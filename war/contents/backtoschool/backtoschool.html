    </span>
    <span class=" articleBody text editorContent " data-editor="span"><p>This guide is intended as a starting point for your journey. It should not be your sole source of&nbsp;information. Once you are on campus, talk to your academic adviser about what services are available&nbsp;to you. Take charge and advocate for yourself.</p>
    </span>
    <span class=" articleBody text editorContent " data-editor="span"><p>Please see your health care provider if you have not been diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury (TBI).&nbsp;Many service members have other conditions that accompany TBI, such as post-traumatic stress. Your&nbsp;provider can help you manage these issues as you return to school.</p>

You don't know exactly what&nbsp;to expect, and it may have been a while since the last time you were in a classroom. Some of the&nbsp;common problems after a TBI can make this decision even more challenging. Ask yourself how&nbsp;well you are managing your time and staying organized. Are you missing a lot of appointments&nbsp;or work deadlines? Are you having a hard time keeping yourself organized? Answering these&nbsp;questions may make the decision easier.</p>

Be open&nbsp;to using those tools and services, even if you think you will only need them for a short period of&nbsp;time. You may have to learn new ways to do things, such as different study or note-taking skills.&nbsp;You may have to use assistive technology, advocate for yourself, and discover better ways to&nbsp;manage or keep track of your time.</p>

            <span class=" articleBody text editorContent " data-editor="span"><p>Think about your ideal learning environment. For example, if you think you need multiple&nbsp;breaks during lectures, online classes may be a good option. Working hard is part of being&nbsp;in the military - the same is true to succeed in school. This means being willing to accept&nbsp;support and help. If you are willing to work hard and receive support, then going back to&nbsp;school is possible.</p>

If you had a diagnosed brain injury, but you haven’t noticed any difficulties, the DSS office can&nbsp;still help you. The word “disability” can mean many different things.

                            <li>Keep a specific schedule that includes class times, time to study, time to read and do&nbsp;assignments, and time to relax. It is important to write this schedule down in either a planner&nbsp;or a smartphone calendar and set reminders to help keep you on track. Choose one tool&nbsp;(phone or planner, not both).

                        <p>Try to keep an open mind about your peers’ opinions. They may not have the same background as you,&nbsp;and you may not always see things the same way. Their life experiences may be different from yours,&nbsp;but you all have gone through difficult times.</p>

                        <p>It takes time to learn about the culture at your school, so try not to get frustrated. If you feel alone,&nbsp;other service members or veterans may share some of your thoughts, like the ones listed below:&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>It is important to connect with your college peers because they can help you with your&nbsp;time in school and later, your civilian life. Look for a community on campus that makes you&nbsp;comfortable. If there isn’t already a group on your campus, start your own!&nbsp;<br>
