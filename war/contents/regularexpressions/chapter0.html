				<h1>Preface</h1>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">This book shows you how to write regular expressions through examples.</span> Its goal is to
				make learning regular expressions as easy as possible. In fact, this book demonstrates
				nearly every concept it presents by way of example so you can easily imitate and try
				them yourself.</p>

				<p>Regular expressions help you find patterns in text strings. More precisely, they are
				specially encoded text strings that match patterns in sets of strings, most often strings
				that are found in documents or files.</p>

				<p>Regular expressions began to emerge when mathematician Stephen Kleene wrote his
				book <em>Introduction to Metamathematics</em> (New York, Van Nostrand), first published in
				1952, though the concepts had been around since the early 1940s. They became more
				widely available to computer scientists with the advent of the Unix operating system—
				the work of Brian Kernighan, Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, and others at AT&amp;T Bell
				Labs—and its utilities, such as <em>sed</em> and <em>grep</em>, in the early 1970s.</p>

				<p>The earliest appearance that I can find of regular expressions in a computer application
				is in the QED editor. QED, short for Quick Editor, was written for the Berkeley Timesharing
				System, which ran on the Scientific Data Systems SDS 940. Documented in
				1970, it was a rewrite by Ken Thompson of a previous editor on MIT’s Compatible
				Time-Sharing System and yielded one of the earliest if not first practical implementations
				of regular expressions in computing. (<strong>Table A-1</strong> in <strong>Appendix</strong> documents the regex
				features of QED.)</p>

				<p>I’ll use a variety of tools to demonstrate the examples. You will, I hope, find most of
				them usable and useful; others won’t be usable because they are not readily available
				on your Windows system. You can skip the ones that aren’t practical for you or that
				aren’t appealing. But I recommend that anyone who is serious about a career in computing
				learn about regular expressions in a Unix-based environment. I have worked in
				that environment for 25 years and still learn new things every day.</p>

				<blockquote>“Those who don’t understand Unix are condemned to reinvent it, poorly.” —Henry
				Spencer</blockquote>

				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber right">vii</div>
				
				<p>Some of the tools I’ll show you are available online via a web browser, which will be
				the easiest for most readers to use. Others you’ll use from a command or a shell prompt,
				and a few you’ll run on the desktop. The tools, if you don’t have them, will be easy to
				download. The majority are free or won’t cost you much money.</p>

				<p>This book also goes light on jargon. I’ll share with you what the correct terms are when
				necessary, but in small doses. I use this approach because over the years, I’ve found
				that jargon can often create barriers. In other words, I’ll try not to overwhelm you with
				the dry language that describes regular expressions. That is because the basic philosophy
				of this book is this: Doing useful things can come before knowing everything about
				a given subject.</p>

				<p>There are lots of different implementations of regular expressions. You will find regular
				expressions used in Unix command-line tools like vi (vim), grep, and sed, among others.
				You will find regular expressions in programming languages like Perl (of course), Java,
				JavaScript, C# or Ruby, and many more, and you will find them in declarative languages
				like XSLT 2.0. You will also find them in applications like Notepad++, Oxygen,
				or TextMate, among many others.</p>

				<p>Most of these implementations have similarities and differences. I won’t cover all those
				differences in this book, but I will touch on a good number of them. If I attempted to
				document all the differences between all implementations, I’d have to be hospitalized.
				I won’t get bogged down in these kinds of details in this book. You’re expecting an
				introductory text, as advertised, and that is what you’ll get.</p>

				<h2>Who Should Read This Book</h2>

				<p>The audience for this book is people who haven't ever written a regular expression
				before. If you are new to regular expressions or programming, this book is a good place
				to start. In other words, I am writing for the reader who has heard of regular expressions
				and is interested in them but who doesn’t really understand them yet. If that is you,
				then this book is a good fit.</p>

				<p>The order I’ll go in to cover the features of regex is from the simple to the complex. In
				other words, we’ll go step by simple step.</p>

				<p>Now, if you happen to already know something about regular expressions and how to
				use them, or if you are an experienced programmer, this book may not be where you
				want to start. This is a beginner’s book, for rank beginners who need some handholding.
				If you have written some regular expressions before, and feel familiar with
				them, you can start here if you want, but I’m planning to take it slower than you will
				probably like.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber left">viii &#124; Preface</div>
				
				<p>I recommend several books to read after this one. First, try Jeff Friedl’s <em>Mastering Regular
				Expressions, Third Edition</em> (see <span class="url">http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565922570
				.do</span>). Friedl’s book gives regular expressions a thorough going over, and I highly recommend
				it. I also recommend the <em>Regular</em> Expressions <em>Cookbook</em> (see <span class="url">http://shop.oreilly
				.com/product/9780596520694.do</span>) by Jan Goyvaerts and Steven Levithan. Jan Goyvaerts
				is the creator of RegexBuddy, a powerful desktop application (see <span class="url">http://www
				.regexbuddy.com/</span>). Steven Levithan created RegexPal, an online regular expression
				processor that you’ll use in the first chapter of this book (see <span class="url">http://www.regexpal.com</span>).</p>

				<h2>What You Need to Use This Book</h2>

				<p>To get the most out of this book, you’ll need access to tools available on Unix or Linux
				operating systems, such as Darwin on the Mac, a variant of BSD (Berkeley Software
				Distribution) on the Mac, or Cygwin on a Windows PC, which offers many GNU tools
				in its distribution (see <span class="url">http://www.cygwin.com</span> and <span class="url">http://www.gnu.org</span>).</p>

				<p>There will be plenty of examples for you to try out here. You can just read them if you
				want, but to really learn, you’ll need to follow as many of them as you can, as the most
				important kind of learning, I think, always comes from doing, not from standing on
				the sidelines. You’ll be introduced to websites that will teach you what regular expressions
				are by highlighting matched results, workhorse command line tools from the Unix
				world, and desktop applications that analyze regular expressions or use them to perform
				text search.</p>

				<p>You will find examples from this book on Github at <span class="url">https://github.com/michaeljames
				fitzgerald/Introducing-Regular-Expressions</span>. You will also find an archive of all the examples
				and test files in this book for download from <span class="url">http://examples.oreilly.com/
				9781449392680/examples.zip</span>. It would be best if you create a working directory or
				folder on your computer and then download these files to that directory before you
				dive into the book.</p>

				<h2>Using Code Examples</h2>

				<p>This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, you may use the code in
				this book in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact us for
				permission unless you’re reproducing a significant portion of the code. For example,
				writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this book does not require
				permission. Selling or distributing a CD-ROM of examples from O’Reilly books does
				require permission. Answering a question by citing this book and quoting example
				code does not require permission. Incorporating a significant amount of example code
				from this book into your product’s documentation does require permission.</p>

				author, publisher, and ISBN. For example: “<em>Introducing Regular Expressions</em> by Michael
				Fitzgerald (O’Reilly). Copyright 2012 Michael Fitzgerald, 978-1-4493-9268-0.”</p>
