				<p><span class="first-sentence">You have already seen some quantifiers at work earlier in this book, but here I’ll talk
				about them in more detail.</span></p>

				<p>For our example this time, we’ll use a Mac desktop application called Reggy (<strong>Figure
				7-1</strong>), as we did in <strong>Chapter 5</strong>. Uncheck <em>Match All</em> at the bottom to start.</p>

				<p>If you are not on a Mac, you can try these examples in one of the applications you’ve
				seen earlier in the book. Paste the right triangle of digits from the <em>triangle.txt</em>. The file
				is in the archive of examples.</p>

				<h2>Greedy, Lazy, and Possessive</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">I’m not talking about your teenager here.</span> I’m talking about quantifiers. These adjectives
				may not sound like good character qualities, but they are interesting features of quantifiers
				that you need to understand if you want to use regular expressions with skill.</p>

				<p>Quantifiers are, by themselves, greedy. A greedy quantifier first tries to match the whole
				string. It grabs as much as it can, the whole input, trying to make a match. If the first
				attempt to match the whole string goes awry, it backs up one character and tries again.
				This is called <em>backtracking</em>. It keeps backing up one character at a time until it finds a
				match or runs out of characters to try. It also keeps track of what it is doing, so it puts
				the most load on resources compared with the next two approaches. It takes a mouthful,
				then spits back a little at a time, chewing on what it just ate. You get the idea.</p>

				<p>A lazy (sometimes called <em>reluctant</em>) quantifier takes a different tack. It starts at the
				beginning of the target, trying to find a match. It looks at the string one character at a
				time, trying to find what it is looking for. At last, it will attempt to match the whole
				string. To get a quantifier to be lazy, you have to append a question mark (?) to the
				regular quantifier. It chews one nibble at a time.</p>

				<p>A possessive quantifier grabs the whole target and then tries to find a match, but it
				makes only one attempt. It does not do any backtracking. A possessive quantifier appends
				a plus sign (+) to the regular quantifier. It doesn’t chew; it just swallows, then
				wonders what it just ate. I’ll demonstrate each of these in the pages that follow.</p>

			<section class="section" data-number="2" data-name="Matching with *, +, and ?">

				<h2>Matching with *, +, and ?</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">If you have the triangle of digits in Reggy, you can now begin testing.</span> First we’ll use the
				Kleene star, named for the man credited as the inventor of regular expressions, Stephen
				Kleene. If you use the star or asterisk following a dot like this:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>.*</code></p>

				<p>it would match, being greedy, all the characters (digits) in the subject text. As you know
				from earlier reading, <code>.*</code> matches any character zero or more times. All the digits in the
				lower box should be highlighted by changing color. Of the Kleene star, an early manual
				said:</p>

				<blockquote>A regular expression followed by “*” [Kleene star] is a regular expression which matches
				any number (including zero) of adjacent occurrences of the text matched by the regular
				expression.</blockquote>

				<p>Now try:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>9*</code></p>

				<p>and the row of nines near the bottom should be highlighted. Now:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>9.*</code></p>

				<div class="pagebreak left"><span class="pageNumber">74</span> | Chapter 7: Quantifiers</div>

				<p>lights up the row of nines and the row of zeros below it. Because <em>Multiline</em> is checked
				(at the bottom of the application window), the dot will match the newline character
				between the rows; normally, it would not.</p>

				<p>To match one or more 9s, try:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>9+</code></p>

				<p>How is that different? You can’t really tell because there are nine 9s in the subject
				text. The main difference is that + is looking for at least one 9, but * is looking for zero
				or more.</p>

				<p>To match zero or one time (optional), use:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>9?</code></p>

				<p>This will match the first occurrence of 9 only. That 9 is considered optional, so because
				it does exist in the subject text, it is matched and highlighted. If you do this:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>99?</code></p>

				<p>then both the first and second 9 are matched.</p>

				<p><strong>Table 7-1</strong> lists the basic quantifiers and some of the possibilities that they have. These
				quantifiers are by default <em>greedy</em>, meaning that they match as many characters as they
				possibly can on the first attempt.</p>

				<h2>Matching a Specific Number of Times</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">When you use braces or squiggly brackets, you can match a pattern a specific number
				of times in a range.</span> Unmodified, these are greedy quantifiers. For example:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>7{1}</code></p>

				<p>will match the first occurrence of 7. If you wanted to match one or <em>more</em> occurrences
				of the number 7, all you have to do is add a comma:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>7{1,}</code></p>

				<p>You've probably realized that both:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>7+</code></p>

				<p>and</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>7{1,}</code></p>

				<div class="pagebreak right">Matching a Specific Number of Times | <span class="pageNumber">75</span></div>

				<p>are essentially the same thing, and that:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>7*</code></p>

				<p>and</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>7{0,}</code></p>

				<p>are likewise the same. In addition:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>7?</code></p>

				<p>is the same as:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>7{0,1}</code></p>

				<p>To find a range of matches, that is, to match <em>m</em> to <em>n</em> times:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>7{3,5}</code></p>

				<p>This will match three, four, or five occurrences of 7.</p>

				<p>So to review, the squiggly bracket or range syntax is the most flexible and precise
				quantifier. <strong>Table 7-2</strong> summarizes these features.</p>

			<section class="section" data-number="4" data-name="Lazy Quantifiers">

				<h2>Lazy Quantifiers</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">Now let’s set aside greediness and get lazy.</span> The easiest way for you to understand this
				is by seeing it in action. In Reggy (making sure <em>Match All</em> is unchecked), try to match
				zero or one 5 using a single question mark (?):</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>5?</code></p>

				<p>The first 5 is highlighted. Add an additional ? to make the quantifier lazy:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>5??</code></p>

				<p>Now it doesn’t appear to match anything. The reason why is that the pattern is being
				lazy, that is, it’s not even forced to match that first 5. By nature, the <em>lazy</em> match matches
				as few characters as it can get away with. It’s a slacker.</p>

				<p>Try this zero or more times:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>5*?</code></p>

				<div class="pagebreak left"><span class="pageNumber">76</span> | Chapter 7: Quantifiers</div>

				<p>and it won’t match anything either, because you gave it the option to match a minimum
				of zero times, and that’s what it does.</p>

				<p>Try it again matching one or more times, &#225; la lazy:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>5+?</code></p>

				<p>And there you go. Lazy just got off the couch and matched one 5. That’s all it had to
				do to keep its day job.</p>

				<p>Things get a bit more interesting as you apply <em>m,n</em> matching. Try this:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>5{2,5}?</code></p>

				<p>Only two 5s are matched, not all five of them, as a greedy match would.</p>

				<p><strong>Table 7-3</strong> lists the lazy quantifiers. When is lazy matching useful? You can use lazy
				matching when you want to match the bare minimum of characters, not the maximum
				possible.</p>

			<section class="section" data-number="5" data-name="Possessive Quantifiers">

				<h2>Possessive Quantifiers</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">A possessive match is like a greedy match, it grabs as much as it can get away with.</span> But
				unlike a greedy match: It does not backtrack. It does not give up anything it finds. It is
				selfish. That is why it is called <em>possessive</em>. Arms folded firmly, it doesn’t give up any
				ground. But the good thing about possessive quantifiers is that they are faster, because
				they don’t do any backtracking, and they also fail in a hurry.</p>

				<div class="pawprints">
					<img src="/contents/regularexpressions/images/pawprints.png">
					<p>The truth is, you can hardly tell the difference between greedy, lazy, and
					possessive matches with the examples in this book. But as you gain more
					experience, and performance tuning becomes important, you’ll want to
					be aware of these differences.</p>
				</div>

				<p>To make sense of this, first we’ll try matching the zeroes with a leading zero, then with
				a trailing zero. In Reggy, make sure <em>Match All</em> is checked, and enter this expression with
				a leading zero:</p>

				<div class="pagebreak right">Possessive Quantifiers | <span class="pageNumber">77</span></div>

				<p class="indented"><code>0.*+</code></p>

				<p>What happened? All the zeroes are highlighted. There was a match. The possessive
				match appears to do the same thing as a greedy match, with one subtle difference: There
				is no backtracking. You can now prove it. Enter this with a trailing zero:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>.*+0</code></p>

				<p>No match. The reason why is there was no backtracking. It gobbled up the entire input
				and never looked back. It wasted its inheritance with riotous living. It can’t find the
				trailing zero. It doesn’t know where to look. If you remove the plus sign, it would find
				all the zeroes as it goes back to a greedy match.</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>.*0</code></p>

				<p>You might want to use a possessive quantifier when you are aware of what is in your
				text, you know where you will find matches. You don’t care if it grabs with gusto. A
				possessive match can help you match with improved performance. <strong>Table 7-4</strong> shows
				the possessive quantifiers.</p>

						<td>Possessive zero or one (optional)</td>

						<td>Possessive zero or more</td>
					</tr>

						<td>{<em>n</em>}+</td>
