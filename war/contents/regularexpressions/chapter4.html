				<h1>Alternation, Groups and<br/>
					Backreferences</h1>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">You have already seen groups in action. Groups surround text with parentheses to help
				perform some operation, such as the following:</span></p>

				<ul>

					<li>Performing alternation, a choice between two or more optional patterns</li>

					<li>Creating subpatterns</li>

					<li>Capturing a group to later reference with a backreference</li>

					<li>Applying an operation to a grouped pattern, such as a quantifer</li>

					<li>Using non-capturing groups</li>

					<li>Atomic grouping (advanced)</li>

				</ul>

				<p>We’ll be using a few contrived examples, in addition to the text from “The Rime of the
				Ancyent Mariner” again, in <em>rime.txt</em>. This time, I’ll use the desktop version of RegExr,
				as well as other tools like <em>sed</em>. You can download the desktop version of RegExr from
				<span class="url">http://www.regexr.com</span>, for Windows, Mac, or Linux (it was written with Adobe AIR).
				Click the Desktop Version link on the RegExr web page (lower-right corner) for more
				information.</p>

			</section>

			<section class="section" data-number="1" data-name="Alternation">

				<h2>Alternation</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">Simply said, <em>alternation</em> gives you a choice of alternate patterns to match.</span> For example,
				let’s say you wanted to find out how many occurrences of the article <em>the</em> are in the “The
				Rime of the Ancient Mariner.” The problem is, the word occurs as <em>THE</em>, <em>The</em>, and <em>the</em>
				in the poem. You can use alternation to deal with this peculiarity.</p>

				<p>Open the RegExr desktop application by double-clicking on its icon. It looks very much
				like the online version but has the advantage of being local on your machine, so you
				won’t suffer the network issues that sometimes occur when using web applications.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber right">41</div>

				<p>I’ve copied and pasted the entire poem in RegExr desktop for the next exercise. I’m
				using it on a Mac running OS X Lion.</p>

				<p>In the top text box, enter the pattern:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>(the|The|THE)</code></p>

				<p>and you’ll see all occurrences of <em>the</em> in the poem highlighted in the lower box (see
				<strong>Figure 4-1</strong>). Use the scroll bar to view more of the result.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/regularexpressions/images/figure4-1.png">
					<figcaption>Figure 4-1. Using alternation in RegExr desktop version</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>We can make this group shorter by applying an option. Options let you specify the way
				you would like to search for a pattern. For example, the option:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>(?i)</code></p>

				<p>makes your pattern case-insensitive, so instead of using the original pattern with alternation,
				you can do this instead:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>(?i)the</code></p>

				<p>Try this in RegExr to see how it works. You can also specify case-insensitivity by
				checking <em>ignoreCase</em> in RegExr, but both will work. This and other options or modifiers
				are listed in <strong>Table 4-1</strong>.</p>

				<p class="table-note">* See “Named Subpatterns” in <span class="url">http://www.pcre.org/pcre.txt</span>.</p>

				<p>Let’s now use alternation with <em>grep</em>. The options in <strong>Table 4-1</strong>, by the way, don’t work
				with <em>grep</em>, so you are going to use the original alternation pattern. To count the number
				of lines where the word <em>the</em> occurs, regardless of case, one or more times, use:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>grep -Ec "(the|The|THE)" rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>and get this answer:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>327</code></p>

				<p>This result does not tell the whole story. Stay tuned.</p>

				<p>Here is an analysis of the <em>grep</em> command:</p>

				<ul>

					<li>The <em>-E</em> option means that you want to use extended regular expressions (EREs)
					rather than basic regular expressions (BREs). This, for example, saves you from
					having to escape the parentheses and the vertical bar, like <code>\(THE\|The\|the\)</code>, as
					you must with BREs.</li>

					<li>The <em>-c</em> option returns a count of the matched lines (not matched words).</li>

					<li>The parentheses group the choice or alternation of the, The, or THE.</li>

					<li>The vertical bar separates possible choices, which are evaluated left to right.</li>

				</ul>

				<p>To get a count of actual words used, this approach will return each occurrence of the
				word, one per line:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>grep -Eo "(the|The|THE)" rime.txt | wc -l</code></p>

				<p>This returns:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>412</code></p>

				<p>And here is a bit more analysis:</p>

				<ul>

					<li>The <em>-o</em> option means to show only that part of the line that matches the pattern,
					though this is not apparent due to the pipe (|) to <em>wc</em>.</li>

				</ul>

				<div class="pagebreak right">Alternation | <span class="pageNumber">43</span></div>

				<ul>

					<li>The vertical bar, in this context, pipes the output of the <em>grep</em> command to the input
					of the <em>wc</em> command. <em>wc</em> is a word count command, and <code>-l</code> counts the number of
					lines of the input.</li>

				</ul>

				<p>Why the big difference between 327 and 412? Because <em>-c</em> gives you a count of matching
				lines, but there can be more than one match on each line. If you use <em>-o</em> with <em>wc -l</em>, then
				each occurrence of the various forms of the word will appear on a separate line and be
				counted, giving the higher number.</p>

				<p>To perform this same match with Perl, write your command this way:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>perl -ne 'print if /(the|The|THE)/' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>Or better yet, you can do it with the <code>(?i)</code> option mentioned earlier, but without
				alternation:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>perl -ne 'print if /(?i)the/' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>Or even better yet, append the <em>i</em> modifier after the last pattern delimiter:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>perl -ne 'print if /the/i' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>and you will get the same outcome. The simpler the better. For a list of additional
				modifiers (also called <em>flags</em>), see <strong>Table 4-2</strong>. Also, compare options (similar but with a
				different syntax) in <strong>Table 4-1</strong>.</p>

			<section class="section" data-number="2" data-name="Subpatterns">

				<h2>Subpatterns</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">Most often, when you refer to <em>subpatterns</em> in regular expressions, you are referring to
				a group or groups within groups.</span> A subpattern is a pattern within a pattern. Often, a
				condition in a subpattern is matchable when a preceding pattern is matched, but not
				always. Subpatterns can be designed in a variety of ways, but we’re concerned primarily
				with those defined within parentheses here.</p>

				<p>In one sense, the pattern you saw earlier:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>(the|The|THE)</code></p>

				<p>has three subpatterns: <em>the</em> is the first subpattern, <em>The</em> is the second, and <em>THE</em> the third,
				but matching the second subpattern, in this instance, is not dependent on matching
				the first. (The leftmost pattern is matched first.)</p>

				<p>Now here is one where the subpattern(s) depend on the previous pattern:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>(t|T)h(e|eir)</code></p>

				<p>In plain language, this will match the literal characters <em>t</em> or <em>T</em> followed by an <em>h</em> followed
				by either an <em>e</em> or the letters <em>eir</em>. Accordingly, this pattern will match any of:</p>

				<ul>

					<li><em>the</em></li>

					<li><em>The</em></li>

					<li><em>their</em></li>

					<li><em>Their</em></li>

				</ul>

				<p>In this case, the second subpattern <code>(e|eir)</code> is dependent on the first <code>(tT)</code>.</p>

				<p>Subpatterns don’t require parentheses. Here is an example of subpatterns done with
				character classes:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>\b[tT]h[ceinry]*\b</code></p>

				<p>This pattern can match, in addition to <em>the</em> or <em>The</em>, words such as <em>thee</em>, <em>thy</em> and <em>thence</em>.
				The two word boundaries (<code>\b</code>) mean the pattern will match whole words, not letters
				embedded in other words.</p>

				<p>Here is a complete analysis of this pattern:</p>

				<ul>

					<li><code>\b</code> matches a beginning word boundary.</li>

					<li><code>[tT]</code> is a character class that matches either an lowercase <em>t</em> or an uppercase <em>T</em>. We
					can consider this the first subpattern.</li>

					<li>Then the pattern matches (or attempts to match) a lowercase <em>h</em>.</li>

					<li>The second or last subpattern is also expressed as a character class <code>[ceinry]</code> followed
					by a quantifier * for zero or more.</li>

					<li>Finally, another word boundary <code>\b</code> ends the pattern.</li>

				</ul>

				<div class="pagebreak right">Subpatterns | <span class="pageNumber">45</span></div>

				<div class="pawprints">
					<img src="/contents/regularexpressions/images/pawprints.png">
					<p>One interesting aspect of the state of regular expressions is that terminology,
					while usually close in meaning, can also range far. In defining
					<em>subpattern</em> and other terms in this book, I’ve examined a variety of sources
					and have tried to bring them together under one roof. But I suspect
					that there are some who would argue that a character class is not a
					subpattern. My take is they can function as subpatterns, so I lump
					them in.</p>
				</div>

			<section class="section" data-number="3" data-name="Capturing Groups and Backreferences">

				<h2>Capturing Groups and Backreferences</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">When a pattern groups all or part of its content into a pair of parentheses, it captures
				that content and stores it temporarily in memory.</span> You can reuse that content if you
				wish by using a backreference, in the form:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>\1</code></p>

				<p>or:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>$1</code></p>

				<p>where <code>\1</code> or <code>$1</code> reference the first captured group, <code>\2</code> or <code>$2</code> reference the second captured
				group, and so on. <em>sed</em> will only accept the <code>\1</code> form, but Perl accepts both.</p>

				<div class="pawprints">
					<img src="/contents/regularexpressions/images/pawprints.png">
					<p>Originally, <em>sed</em> supported backreferences in the range <code>\1</code> through <code>\9</code>, but
					that limitation does not appear to exist any longer.</p>
				</div>

				<p>You have already seen this in action, but I’ll demonstrate it here again. We’ll use it to
				rearrange the wording of a line of the poem, with apologies to Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
				In the top text box in RegExr, after clicking the Replace tab, enter this pattern:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>(It is) (an ancyent Marinere)</code></p>

				<p>Scroll the subject text (third text area) down until you can see the highlighted line, and
				then in the second box, enter:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>$2 $1</code></p>

				<p>and you’ll see in the lowest box the line rearranged as:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>an ancyent Marinere It is,</code></p>

				<p>(See <strong>Figure 4-2</strong>.)</p>

				<div class="pagebreak left"><span class="pageNumber">46</span> | Chapter 4: Alternation, Groups, and Backreferences</div>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/regularexpressions/images/figure4-2.png">
					<figcaption>Figure 4-2. Referencing backreferences with $1 and $2</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>Here is how to accomplish the same result with <em>sed</em>:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>sed -En 's/(It is) (an ancyent Marinere)/\2 \1/p' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>and the output will be:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>an ancyent Marinere It is,</code></p>

				<p>just as in RegExr. Let’s analyze the <em>sed</em> command to help you understand everything
				that is going on:</p>

				<ul>

					<li>The <em>-E</em> option once again invokes EREs, so you don’t have to quote the parentheses,
					for example.</li>

					<li>The <em>-n</em> option suppresses the default behavior of printing every line.</li>

					<li>The substitute command searches for a match for the text “It is an ancyent Marinere,”
					capturing it into two groups.</li>

					<li>The substitute command also replaces the match by rearranging the captured text
					in the output, with the backreference <code>\2</code> first, then <code>\1</code>.</li>

					<li>The <em>p</em> at the end of the substitute command means you want to print the line.</li>

				</ul>

				<div class="pagebreak right">Capturing Groups and Backreferences | <span class="pageNumber">47</span></div>

				<p>A similar command in Perl will do the same thing:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>perl -ne 'print if s/(It is) (an ancyent Marinere)/\2 \1/' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>Notice that this uses the <code>\1</code> style syntax. You can, of course, use the <code>$1</code> syntax, too:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>perl -ne 'print if s/(It is) (an ancyent Marinere)/$2 $1/' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>I like how Perl lets you print a selected line without jumping through hoops.</p>

				<p>I’d like to point out something about the output:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>an ancyent Marinere It is,</code></p>

				<p>The capitalization got mixed up in the transformation. Perl can fix that with <code>\u</code> and
				<code>\l</code>. Here’s how:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>perl -ne 'print if s/(It is) (an ancyent Marinere)/\u$2 \l$1/' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>Now the result looks much better:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>An ancyent Marinere it is,</code></p>

				<p>And here is why:</p>

				<ul>

					<li>The <code>\l</code> syntax does not match anything, but it changes the character that follows
					to lowercase.</li>

					<li>The <code>\u</code> syntax capitalizes the character that follows it.</li>

					<li>The <code>\U</code> directive (not shown) turns the text string that follows into all uppercase.</li>

					<li>The <code>\L</code> directive (not shown) turns the text string that follows into all lowercase.</li>

				</ul>

				<p>These directives remain in effect until another is found (like <code>\l</code> or <code>\E</code>, the end of a
				quoted string). Experiment with these to see how they work.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="4" data-name="Named Groups">

					<h4>Named Groups</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence"><em>Named groups</em> are captured groups with names.</span> You can access those groups by name
					later, rather than by integer. I’ll show you how here in Perl:</p>

					<p class="indented"><code>perl -ne 'print if s/(?<one>It is) (?<two>an ancyent Marinere)/\u$+{two}<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\l$+{one}/' rime.txt</code></p>

					<p>Let's look at it:</p>

					<ul>

						<li>Adding <code>?&lt;one&gt;</code> and <code>?&lt;two&gt;</code> inside the parentheses names the groups <em>one</em> and <em>two</em>,
						respectively.</li>

						<li>$+{one} references the group named one, and $+{two}, the group named two.</li>

					</ul>

					<p>You can also reuse named groups within the pattern where the group was named. I’ll
					show you what I mean. Let’s say you were searching for a string that contained six
					zeros all together:</p>

					<p class="indented"><code>000000</code></p>

					<div class="pagebreak left"><span class="pageNumber">48</span> | Chapter 4: Alternation, Groups, and Backreferences</div>

					<p>It’s a shallow example, but serves to show you how this works. So name a group of
					three zeros with this pattern (the <em>z</em> is arbitrary):</p>

					<p class="indented"><code>(?&lt;z&gt;0{3})</code></p>

					<p>You can then use the group again like this:</p>

					<p class="indented"><code>(?&lt;z&gt;0{3})\k&lt;z&gt;</code></p>

					<p>Or this:</p>

					<p class="indented"><code>(?&lt;z&gt;0{3})\k'z'</code></p>

					<p>Or this:</p>

					<p class="indented"><code>(?&lt;z&gt;0{3})\g{z}</code></p>

					<p>Try this in RegExr for quick results. All these examples will work. <strong>Table 4-3</strong> shows
					many of the possibilities with named group syntax.</p>

			<section class="section" data-number="5" data-name="Non-Capturing Groups">

				<h2>Non-Capturing Groups</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">There are also groups that are non-capturing groups—that is, they don’t store their
				content in memory.</span> Sometimes this is an advantage, especially if you never intend to
				reference the group. Because it doesn’t store its content, it is possible it may yield better
				performance, though performance issues are hardly perceptible when running the simple
				examples in this book.</p>

				<p>Remember the first group discussed in this chapter? Here it is again:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>(the|The|THE)</code></p>

				<p>You don’t need to backreference anything, so you could write a non-capturing group
				this way:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>(?:the|The|THE)</code></p>

				<p>Going back to the beginning of this chapter, you could add an option to make the
				pattern case-insensitive, like this (though the option obviates the need for a group):</p>

				<div class="pagebreak right">Non-Capturing Groups | <span class="pageNumber">49</span></div>

				<p class="indented"><code>(?i)(?:the)</code></p>

				<p>Or you could do it this way:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>(?:(?i)the)</code></p>

				<p>Or, better yet, the <em>pièce de résistance</em>:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>(?i:the)</code></p>

				<p>The option letter <em>i</em> can be inserted between the question mark and the colon.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="6" data-name="Atomic Groups">

					<h4>Atomic Groups</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Another kind of non-capturing group is the <em>atomic group</em>.</span> If you are using a regex engine
					that does backtracking, this group will turn backtracking off, not for the entire regular
					expression but just for that part enclosed in the atomic group. The syntax looks like this:</p>

					<p class="indented"><code>(?&gt;the)</code></p>

					<p>When would you want to use atomic groups? One of the things that can really slow
					regex processing is backtracking. The reason why is, as it tries all the possibilities, it
					takes time and computing resources. Sometimes it can gobble up a lot of time. When
					it gets really bad, it’s called <em>catastrophic backtracking</em>.</p>

					<p>You can turn off backtracking altogether by using a non-backtracking engine like re2
					(<span class="url">http://code.google.com/p/re2/</span>) or by turning it off for parts of your regular expression
					with atomic grouping.</p>

					<div class="pawprints">
						<img src="/contents/regularexpressions/images/pawprints.png">
						<p>My focus in this book is to introduce syntax. I talk very little about
