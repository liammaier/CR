			<section class="intro" data-number="0" data-name="Chapter 3 Introduction">

				<h1>Boundaries</h1>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">This chapter focuses on assertions. Assertions mark boundaries, but they don’t consume
				characters—that is, characters will not be returned in a result.</span> They are also
				known as <em>zero-width assertions</em>. A zero-width assertion doesn’t match a character, per
				se, but rather a location in a string. Some of these, such as <code>^</code> and $, are also called anchors.</p>

				<p>The boundaries I'll talk about in this chapter are:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The beginning and end of a line or string</li>
					<li>Word boundaries (two kinds)</li>
					<li>The beginning and end of a subject</li>
					<li>Boundaries that quote string literals</li>
				</ul>

				<p>To start, I’ll use RegExr again, but this time, for variety, I’ll use the Safari browser
				(however, you can use any browser you like). I’ll also use the same text I used last time:
				the first 12 lines of <em>rime.txt</em>. Open the Safari browser with <span class="url">http://gskinner.com/regexr</span>
				and copy the first 12 lines of <em>rime.txt</em> from the code archive into the lower box.</p>

			</section>

			<section class="section" data-number="1" data-name="The Beginning and End of a Line">

				<h2>The Beginning and End of a Line</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">As you have seen a number of times already, to match the beginning of a line or string,
				use the caret or circumflex (U+005E):</span></p>

				<p class="indented"><code>^</code></p>

				<p>Depending on the context, a <code>^</code> will match the beginning of a line or string, sometimes
				a whole document. The context depends on your application and what options you
				are using with that application.</p>

				<p>To match the end of a line or string, as you know, use the dollar sign:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>$</code></p>

				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber right">29</div>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/regularexpressions/images/figure3-1.png">
					<figcaption>Figure 3-1. RegExr in Safari</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>In RegExr, make sure that <em>multiline</em> is checked. <em>global</em> is checked by default when you
				open RegExr, but you can leave it checked or unchecked for this example. When
				<em>multiline</em> is not checked, the entire target is considered one string.</p>

				<p>In the upper text box, enter this regular expression:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>^How.*Country\.$</code></p>

				<p>This will match the entire line beginning with the word <em>How</em>. Notice that the period
				or dot at the end is preceded by a backslash. This escapes the dot so that it is interpreted
				as a literal. If it was not escaped, what would it match? Any character. If you want to
				match a literal dot, you have to either escape it or put it in a character class (see
				<strong>Chapter 5</strong>).</p>

				<p>If you uncheck <em>multiline</em>, then what happens? The highlighting is turned off. With it
				unchecked and <em>dotall</em> checked, enter:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>^THE.*\?$</code></p>

				<p>and you’ll see that it matches all the text.</p>

				<p>The <em>dotall</em> option means that the dot will match newlines in addition to all other characters.
				Uncheck <em>dotall</em>, and the expression matches nothing. However, the following:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>^THE.*</code></p>

				<div class="pagebreak left"><span class="pageNumber">30</span> | Chapter 3: Boundaries</div>

				<p>will match the first line. Click <em>dotall</em> again, and all text is matched again. The <code>\?$</code> is not
				required to match to the end of the text.</p>

			</section>

			<section class="section" data-number="2" data-name="Word and Non-word Boundaries">

				<h2>Word and Non-word Boundaries</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">You have already seen <code>\b</code> used several times.</span> It marks a word boundary. Try:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>\bTHE\b</code></p>

				<p>and it will match both occurrences of <em>THE</em> in the first line (with <em>global</em> checked). Like
				<code>^</code> or <code>$</code>, <code>\b</code> is a zero-width assertion. It may appear to match things like a space or the
				beginning of a line, but in actuality, what it matches is a zero-width nothing. Did you
				notice that the spaces around the second <em>THE</em> are not highlighted? That is because they
				are not part of the match. Not the easiest thing to grasp, but you’ll get it by seeing what
				it does and does not do.</p>

				<p>You can also match non-word boundaries. A non-word boundary matches locations
				that are not equivalent to a word boundary, like a letter or a number within a word or
				string. To match a non-word boundary, give this a spin:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>\Be\B</code></p>

				<p>and watch what it matches (see <strong>Figure 3-2</strong>). You’ll see that it matches a lowercase <em>e</em>
				when it is surrounded by other letters or non-word characters. Being a zero-width assertion,
				it does not match the surrounding characters, but it recognizes when the literal
				<em>e</em> is surrounded by non-word boundaries.</p>

				<p>In some applications, another way for specifying a word boundary is with:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>\&lt;</code></p>

				<p>for the beginning of a word, and with:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>\&gt;</code></p>

				<p>for the end of the word. This is an older syntax, not available in most recent regex
				applications. It is useful in some instances because, unlike <code>\b</code>, which matches <em>any</em> word
				boundary, this syntax allows you to match either the beginning or ending of a word.</p>

				<p>If you have <em>vi</em> or <em>vim</em> on your system, you can try this out with that editor. Just follow
				these steps. They’re easy even if you have never used <em>vim</em> before. In a command or shell
				window, change directories to where the poem is located and then open it with:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>vim rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>Then enter the following search command:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>/\&gt;</code></p>

				<p>and press Enter or Return. The forward slash (<code>/</code>) is the way you begin a search in <em>vim</em>.
				Watch the cursor and you’ll see that this search will find the ends of words. Press <em>n</em> to
				repeat the search. Next enter:</p>

				<div class="pagebreak right">Word and Non-word Boundaries | <span class="pageNumber">31</span></div>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/regularexpressions/images/figure3-2.png">
					<figcaption>Figure 3-2. Matching non-word boundaries with \B</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p class="indented"><code>/\&lt;</code></p>

				<p>followed by Enter or Return. This time the search will find the beginning of words. To
				exit <em>vim</em>, just type ZZ.</p>

				<p>This syntax also works with <em>grep</em>. Since the early 1970s, <em>grep</em> like <em>sed</em> has been a Unix
				mainstay. (In the 1980s, I had a coworker who had a vanity license plate that said
				<em>GREP</em>.) Try this command from a shell prompt:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>grep -Eoc '\<(THE|The|the)\>' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>The <em>-E</em> option indicates that you want to use extended regular expressions (EREs) rather
				than the basic regular expressions (BREs) which are used by <em>grep</em> by default. The <code>-o</code>
				option means you want to show in the result only that part of the line that matches the
				pattern, and the <code>-c</code> option means only return a count of the result. The pattern in single
				quotes will match either <em>THE</em>, <em>The</em>, or <em>the</em> as whole words. That’s what the <code>\&lt;</code> and <code>\&gt;</code>
				help you find.</p>

				<p>This command will return:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>259</code></p>

				<p>which is the count of the words found.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak left"><span class="pageNumber">32</span> | Chapter 3: Boundaries</div>

				<p>On the other hand, if you don’t include the <code>\&lt;</code> and <code>\&gt;</code>, you get a different result. Do it
				this way:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>grep -Eoc '(THE|The|the)' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>and you will get a different number:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>327</code></p>

				<p>Why? Because the pattern will match only whole words, plus <em>any</em> sequence of characters
				that contain the word. So that is one reason why the <code>\&lt;</code> and <code>\>&gt;</code> can come in handy.</p>

			</section>

			<section class="section" data-number="3" data-name="Other Anchors">

				<h2>Other Anchors</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">Similar to the <code>^</code> anchor is the following, a shorthand that matches the start of a subject:</span></p>

				<p class="indented"><code>\A</code></p>

				<p>This is not available with all regex implementations, but you can get it with Perl and
				PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions), for example. To match the end of a
				subject, you can use <code>\A</code>’s companion.</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>\Z</code></p>

				<p>Also, in some contexts:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>\z</code></p>

				<p><em>pcregrep</em> is a version of <em>grep</em> for the PCRE library. (See <strong>“Technical
				Notes” on page 38</strong> to find out where to get it.) Once installed, to try this syntax with
				<em>pcregrep</em>, you could do something like this:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>pcregrep -c '\A\s*(THE|The|the)' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>which will return a count (<code>-c</code>) of 108 occurrences of the word <em>the</em> (in three cases) which
				occur near the beginning of a line, preceded by whitespace (zero or more). Next enter
				this command:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>pcregrep -n '(MARINERE|Marinere)(.)?\Z' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>This matches either <em>MARINERE</em> or <em>Marinere</em> at the end of a line (subject) and is followed
				by any optional character, which in this case is either a punctuation mark or the
				letter <em>S</em>. (The parentheses around the dot are not essential.)</p>

				<p>You’ll see this output:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>1:THE RIME OF THE ANCYENT MARINERE,<br/>
				10: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an ancyent Marinere,<br/>
				38: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright-eyed Marinere.<br/>
				63: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright-eyed Marinere.<br/>
				105: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God save thee, ancyent Marinere!<br/>
				282:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I fear thee, ancyent Marinere!<br/>
				702: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loves to talk with Marineres</code></p>

				<div class="pagebreak right">Other Anchors | <span class="pageNumber">33</span></div>

				<p>The <code>-n</code> option with <em>pcregrep</em> gives you the line numbers at the beginning of each line
				of output. The command line options of <em>pcregrep</em> are very similar to those of <em>grep</em>. To
				see them, do:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>pcre --help</code></p>

			</section>

			<section class="section" data-number="4" data-name="Quoting a Group of Characters as Literals">

				<h2>Quoting a Group of Characters as Literals</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">You can use these sequences to quote a set of characters as literals:</span></p>

				<p class="indented"><code>\Q</code></p>

				<p>and</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>\E</code></p>

				<p>To show you how this works, enter the following metacharacters in the lower box of
				RegExr:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>.^$*+?|(){}[]\-</code></p>

				<p>These 15 metacharacters are treated as special characters in regular expressions, used
				for encoding a pattern. (The hyphen is treated specially, as signifying a range, inside of
				the square brackets of a character class. Otherwise, it’s not special.)</p>

				<p>If you try to match those characters in the upper text box of RegExr, nothing will
				happen. Why? Because RegExr thinks (if it can think) that you are entering a regular
				expression, not literal characters. Now try:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>\Q$\E</code></p>

				<p>and it will match <code>$</code> because anything between <code>\Q</code> and <code>\E</code> is interpreted as a literal
				character (see <strong>Figure 3-3</strong>). (Remember, you can precede a metacharacter with a \ to
				make it literal.)</p>

			</section>

			<section class="section" data-number="5" data-name="Adding Tags">

				<h2>Adding Tags</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">In RegExr, uncheck <em>global</em> and check <em>multiline</em>, click the Replace tab, and then, in the
				first text box (marked number 1 in <strong>Figure 3-4</strong>), enter:</span></p>

				<p class="indented"><code>^(.*)$</code></p>

				<p>This will match and capture the first line of text. Then in the next box (marked number
				2), enter this or something similar:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang="en"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Rime&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n<br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;$1&lt;/h1&gt;</code></p>

				<p>As you enter the replacement text, you’ll notice that the subject text (shown in the box
				marked number 3) is changed in the results text box (marked number 4), to include
				the markup you’ve added (see <strong>Figure 3-4</strong>).</p>

				<div class="pagebreak left"><span class="pageNumber">34</span> | Chapter 3: Boundaries</div>

				</figure>

				<div class="pagebreak right">Adding Tags | <span class="pageNumber">35</span></div>

				<p>RegExr does well to demonstrate one way to do this, but it is limited in what it can do.
				For example, it can’t save any results out to a file. We have to look beyond the browser
				for that.</p>

			</section>

			<section class="section" data-number="6" data-name="Adding Tags with sed">

				<h2>Adding Tags with <em>sed</em></h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">On a command line, you could also do something similar to what we just did in RegExr
				with <em>sed</em>, which you saw in the last chapter.</span> The insert (i) command in <em>sed</em> allows you
				to insert text above or before a location in a document or a string. By the way, the
				opposite of <em>i</em> in <em>sed</em> is <em>a</em>, which appends text below or after a location. We’ll use the
				append command later.</p>

				<p>The following command inserts the HTML5 doctype and several other tags, beginning
				at line 1:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>
					sed '1 i\
					&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\<br/>
					&lt;html lang="en"&gt;\<br/>
					&lt;head&gt;\<br/>
					&lt;title&gt;Rime&lt;/title&gt;\<br/>
					&lt;/head&gt;\<br/>
					&lt;body&gt;
				</code></p>

				<p class="indented"><code>
					s/^/&lt;h1&gt;/<br/>
					s/$/&lt;\/h1&gt;/<br/>
					q' rime.txt
				</code></p>

				<p>The backslashes (<code>\</code>) at the end of the lines allow you to insert newlines into the stream
				and not execute the command prematurely. The backslashes in front of the quotation
				marks <em>escape</em> the quotes so that they are seen as literal characters, not part of the
				command.</p>

				<p>When you run this <em>sed</em> command correctly, this is what your output will look like:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>
					&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br/>
					&lt;html lang="en"&gt;<br/>
					&lt;head&gt;<br/>
					&lt;title&gt;The Rime of the Ancyent Mariner (1798)&lt;/title&gt;<br/>
					&lt;/head&gt;<br/>
					&lt;body&gt;<br/>
					&lt;h1&gt;THE RIME OF THE ANCYENT MARINERE, IN SEVEN PARTS.&lt;/h1&gt;
				</code></p>

				<p>These same <em>sed</em> commands are saved in the file <em>top.sed</em> in the example archive. You can
				run this on the file using this command:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>sed -f top.sed rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>You should get the same output as you saw in the previous command. If you want to
				save the output to a file, you can redirect the output to a file, like so:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>sed -f top.sed rime.txt > temp</code></p>

				<div class="pagebreak left"><span class="pageNumber">36</span> | Chapter 3: Boundaries</div>

				<p>In addition to showing the result on the screen, this redirect part of the command
				(<code>&gt; temp</code>) will save the output to the file <em>temp</em>.</p>

			</section>

			<section class="section" data-number="7" data-name="Adding Tags with Perl">

				<h2>Adding Tags with Perl</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">Let’s try to accomplish this same thing with Perl. Without explaining everything that’s
				going on, just try this:</span></p>

				<p class="indented"><code>
					perl -ne 'print "&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\<br/>
					&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\<br/>
					&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Rime&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\<br/>
					&lt;body&gt;\<br/>
					" if $. == 1;<br/>
					s/^/&lt;h1&gt;/;s/$/&lt;\/h1&gt;/m;print;exit;' rime.txt
				</code></p>

				<p>Compare this with the <em>sed</em> command. How is it similar? How is it different? The <em>sed</em>
				command is a little simpler, but Perl is a lot more powerful, in my opinion.</p>

				<p>Here is how it works:</p>

				<ul>

					<li>The <code>$.</code> variable, which is tested with the <em>if</em> statement, represents the current line.
					The <em>if</em> statement returns <em>true</em>, meaning it passes the test that the current line is line
					1.</li>

					<li>When Perl finds line 1 with <em>if</em>, it prints the doctype and a few HTML tags. It is
					necessary to escape the quote marks as in <em>sed</em>.</li>

					<li>The first substitution inserts an <em>h1</em> start-tag at the beginning of the line, and the
					second one inserts an <em>h1</em> end-tag at the end of the line. The <em>m</em> at the end of the
					second substitution means that it uses a <em>multiline</em> modifier. This is done so that
					the command recognizes the end of the first line. Without <em>m</em>, the $ would match
					to the end of the file.</li>

					<li>The <em>print</em> command prints the result of the substitutions.</li>

					<li>The <em>exit</em> command exits Perl immediately. Otherwise, because of <code>-n</code> option, it
					would loop through every line of the file, which we don’t want for this script.</li>

				</ul>

				<p>That was a lot of typing, so I put all that Perl code in a file and called it <em>top.pl</em>, also found in the code archive.</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>
					#!/usr/bin/perl -n
				</code></p>

				<p class="indented"><code>
					if ($ == 1) {<br/>
					print "&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\<br/>
					&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\<br/>
					&lt;head&gt;\<br/>
					&lt;title&gt;The Rime of the Ancyent Mariner (1798)&lt;/title&gt;\<br/>
					&lt;/head&gt;\<br/>
					&lt;body&gt;\<br/>
					";<br/>
					s/^/&lt;h1&gt;/;<br/>
					s/$/&lt;\/h1&gt;/m;<br/>
					print;
				</code></p>

				<div class="pagebreak right">Adding Tags | <span class="pageNumber">37</span></div>

				<p class="indented"><code>
					exit;<br/>
					}
				</code></p>

				<p>Run this with:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>perl top.pl rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>You get a similar output as in the previous command, though it is formed a little differently.
				(You can redirect the output with <code>
				&gt;</code>, as with <em>sed</em>.)</p>

				<p>The next chapter covers alternation, groups, and backreferences, among other things.
				See you over there.</p>
