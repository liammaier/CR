				<h1>Lookarounds</h1>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">Lookarounds are non-capturing groups that match patterns based on what they find
				either in front of or behind a pattern.</span> Lookarounds are also considered <em>zero-width
				assertions</em>.</p>

				<p>Lookarounds include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Positive lookaheads</li>
					<li>Negative lookaheads</li>
					<li>Positive lookbehinds</li>
					<li>Negative lookbehinds</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In this chapter, I’ll show you how each of these works. We’ll start out using RegExr on
				the desktop and then move on to Perl and <em>ack</em> (<em>grep</em> doesn’t know about lookarounds).
				Our text is still Coleridge’s well-worn poem.</p>

			</section>

			<section class="section" data-number="1" data-name="Positive Lookaheads">

				<h2>Positive Lookaheads</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">Suppose you want to find every occurrence of the word <em>ancyent</em> that is followed by
				<em>marinere</em> (I use the archaic spellings because that is what is found in the file).</span> To do
				this, we could use a positive lookahead.</p>

				<p>First let’s try it in RegExr desktop. The following case-insentitive pattern goes in the
				text box at the top:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>(?i)ancyent (?=marinere)</code></p>

				<div class="pawprints">
					<img src="/contents/regularexpressions/images/pawprints.png">
					<p>You can also specify case-insensitivity with RegExr by simply checking
					the box next to <em>ignoreCase</em>, but both methods work.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber right">81</div>

				<p>Because you use the case-insensitive option (?i), you don’t need to worry about what
				case you use in your pattern. You are looking for every line that has the word <em>ancyent</em>
				followed hard by <em>marinere</em>. The results will be highlighted in the text area below the
				pattern area (see <strong>Figure 8-1</strong>); however, only the first part of the pattern will be highlighted
				(<em>ancyent</em>), not the lookahead pattern (<em>Marinere</em>).</p>

					<img src="/contents/regularexpressions/images/figure8-1.png">
					<figcaption>Figure 8-1. Positive lookahead in RegExr</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>Let’s now use Perl to do a positive lookahead. You can form the command like so:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>perl -ne 'print if /(?i)ancyent (?=marinere)/' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>and the output should look like this:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>THE RIME OF THE ANCYENT MARINERE, IN SEVEN PARTS.<br/>
				How a Ship having passed the Line was driven by Storms to the cold Country towards<br/>
				the South Pole; and how from thence she made her course to the tropical Latitude of<br/>
				the Great Pacific Ocean; and of the strange things that befell; and in what manner the<br/>
				Ancyent Marinere came back to his own Country.<br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an ancyent Marinere,
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God save thee, ancyent Marinere!
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I fear thee, ancyent Marinere!</code></p>

				<p>There are five lines in the poem where the word <em>ancyent</em> shows up right before the word
				<em>marinere</em>. What if we just wanted to check if the word following <em>ancyent</em> started with
				the letter <em>m</em>, either in upper- or lowercase? We could do it this way:</p>


				<p class="indented"><code>perl -ne 'print if /(?i)ancyent (?=m)/' rime.txt</code></p>

				<div class="pagebreak left"><span class="pageNumber">82</span> | Chapter 8: Lookarounds</div>

				<p>In addition to Marinere, you would get <code>man</code> and Man:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>And thus spake on that ancyent man,<br/>
				And thus spake on that ancyent Man,</code></p>

				<p><em>ack</em> also can do lookarounds as it is written in Perl. The command-line interface for
				<em>ack</em> is very similar to <em>grep</em>.</p>

				<p>Try this:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>ack '(?i)ancyent (?=ma)' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>and you’ll see highlighted results, as shown in <strong>Figure 8-2</strong>.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/regularexpressions/images/figure8-2.png">
					<figcaption>Figure 8-2. Positive lookahead with ack in Terminal</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>With <em>ack</em>, you can specify case-insensitivity with the command-line option <em>-i</em>, rather
				than with the embedded option (<code>?i</code>):</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>ack -i 'ancyent (?=ma)' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>I’ll throw something in here for good measure. If you want to add line numbers to
				<em>ack</em>’s output, you can do several things. You can add the <em>-H</em> option:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>ack -Hi 'ancyent (?=ma)' rime.txt</code></p>

				<div class="pagebreak right">Positive Lookaheads | <span class="pageNumber">83</span></div>

				<p>Or you could add this code with the <em>--output</em> option:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>ack -i --output '$.:$_' 'ancyent (?=ma)' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>This is a bit of a hack, and turns off highlighting, but it works.</p>

			<section class="section" data-number="2" data-name="Negative Lookaheads">

				<h2>Negative Lookaheads</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">The flip side of a positive lookahead is a negative lookahead.</span> This means that as you
				try to match a pattern, you <em>won’t</em> find a given lookahead pattern. A negative lookahead
				is formed like this:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>(?i)ancyent (?!marinere)</code></p>

				<p>Only one character changed: The equals sign (=) in the positive lookahead became an
				exclamation point (!) in the negative lookahead. <strong>Figure 8-3</strong> shows you this negative
				lookahead in Opera.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/regularexpressions/images/figure8-3.png">
					<figcaption>Figure 8-3. Negative lookahead with RegExr in Opera</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>In Perl, we could do a negative lookahead this way:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>perl -ne 'print if /(?i)ancyent (?!marinere)/' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>and this is what we would get back:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>And thus spake on that ancyent man,<br/>
				And thus spake on that ancyent Man,</code></p>

				<div class="pagebreak left"><span class="pageNumber">84</span> | Chapter 8: Lookarounds</div>

				<p>In <em>ack</em>, the same results could be produced with:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>ack -i 'ancyent (?!marinere)' rime.txt</code></p>

			</section>

			<section class="section" data-number="3" data-name="Positive Lookbehinds">

				<h2>Positive Lookbehinds</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">A positive lookbehind looks to the left, in the opposite direction as a lookahead.</span> The
				syntax is:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>(?i)(?&lt;=ancyent) marinere</code></p>

				<p>The positive lookbehind throws in a less-than sign (&lt;), reminding you which direction
				lookbehind is. Try this in RegExr and see what the difference is. Instead of <em>ancyent</em>
				being highlighted, <em>marinere</em> is. Why? Because the positive lookbehind is a condition of
				the match and is not included or consumed in the match results.</p>

				<p>Do it like so in Perl:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>perl -ne 'print if /(?i)(?&lt;=ancyent) marinere/' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>And like this with <em>ack</em></p>

			</section>

			<section class="section" data-number="4" data-name="Negative Lookbehinds">

				<h2>Negative Lookbehinds</h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">Finally, there is the negative lookbehind.</span> And how do you think this one works?</p>

				<p>It is looking to see if a pattern does <em>not</em> show up behind in the left-to-right stream of
				text. Again, it adds a less-than sign (&lt;), reminding you which direction lookbehind is.</p>

				<p>Do this in RegExr and see the results.</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>(?1)(?&lt;!ancyent) marinere</code></p>

				<p>Scroll down to see what you got.</p>

				<p>Then try it in Perl:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>perl -ne 'print if /(?i)(?&lt;!ancyent) marinere/' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>What you should see is this, with no sign of <em>ancyent</em> anywhere:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marinere hath his will.<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright-eyed Marinere.<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright-eyed Marinere.<br/>
					The Marineres gave it biscuit-worms,<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came to the Marinere's hollo!<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came to the Marinere's hollo!<br/>
					The Marineres all 'gan work the ropes,<br/>
					The Marineres all return'd to work<br/>
					The Marineres all 'gan pull the ropes,<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the Marinere's trance is abated."<br/>
					He loves to talk with Marineres<br/>
					The Marinere, whose eye is bright,
				</code></p>

				<div class="pagebreak right">Negative Lookbehinds | <span class="pageNumber">85</span></div>

				<p>And, lastly, do it this way in <em>ack</em>:</p>

				<p class="indented"><code>ack -i '(?&lt;!ancyent) marinere' rime.txt</code></p>

				<p>That wraps up our brief introduction to for lookaheads and lookbehinds, a powerful
				feature of modern regular expressions.</p>

				<p>In the next chapter, you’ll see a full example of how to mark up a document with
				HTML5 using <em>sed</em> and Perl.</p>
