				If climate had no significant impact on Earth’s 
				ecosystems and living things, climate change 
				would be a mere curiosity of planetary science. 
				Instead, we know that ecosystems evolved in 
				concert with predictable annual weather patterns 
				for survival. Changing weather patterns affect 
				where plants can grow and where animals can 
				thrive. Even small changes in climate can tip the 
				delicate balance of competition and cooperation 
				among the residents of an ecosystem. The 
				potential for climate change to disrupt life on 
				Earth makes studying it essential.

				to produce accurate climate forecasts. Living things are vulnerable to climate change; in a warming 
				world, plants and animals will face significant changes in their habitats. Some species have already 
				demonstrated the ability to adapt to a changing climate, but we do not yet have a full understanding 
				of the implications of anthropogenic climate change on the planet’s plant and animal species.
				Long-term environmental observations, fieldwork, and statistical analyses of ecosystem data have yielded 
				important information about the effects of climate change on the biosphere. In the research highlights

				On a global scale, Raymond Huey of the University of Washington and George Gilchrist of the 
				College of William and Mary have found genetic changes in fruit flies that correspond to temperature 
				increases. In their study, they examined a certain type of genetic change known as a chromosomal 
				inversion. More than 40 years ago, scientists documented these genetic rearrangements in wild 
				populations of the fruit fly species Drosophila subobscuraand noted that the frequency of the inversions 
				correlated with the flies’ latitude. Although the exact purpose of the inversion is unknown, it appears 
				to protect the flies against warm temperatures. Huey and Gilchrist used the past data and added 
				information on present-day fruit flies on three continents. Their analysis shows genetic differences 
				between contemporary fruit flies and 1981 populations: Flies at higher latitudes have more of the 
				low-latitude chromosomal inversions. In other words, these flies have undergone genetic adaptation to 
				warmer temperatures. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 13082 BIO/DEB</span>

				Climate change has resulted in heritable genetic changes in species as diverse as birds, squirrels, and 
				mosquitoes, and in traits such as range limits, reproductive patterns, dormancy, and migration. Because 
				the most obvious facet of climate change is increasing temperatures, it is tempting to simply attribute 
				these genetic changes to higher temperatures. However, many species use day length as a critical cue, 
				and changing temperatures can lead to a mismatch between those cues and environmental conditions. 
				As discussed by William E. Bradshaw and Christina M. Holzapfel of the University of Oregon in a 
				recent publication, scientists are discovering that adaptation to changes in day length and the timing of 
				growing seasons can be important when species adapt to climate change. 
			</p></span><span  class = "  articleBody text editorContent " data-editor='span'><p>
				In a study involving the pitcher-plant mosquito, Bradshaw and colleagues experimentally raised 
				mosquitoes from a northern population in a simulated southern climate with shorter days. The 
				mosquitoes laid fewer eggs— 88 percent of the loss was due to transplanted mosquitoes experiencing 
				the incorrect day length relative to temperature. As climate change occurs, many species in the 
				Northern Hemisphere will migrate northward to avoid increasing heat stress. However, species for 
				which day length is an important determinant of development and reproduction will have to adapt 
				to the new day length to avoid a mismatch. This study emphasizes the complex nature of global 
				change and the need to understand how many aspects of that change will interact with organisms

				sizes may have no options but to migrate to cooler climates, suffer declines in population size, or

Damage to the leaves of hardwood trees by herbivorous insects may be reduced in the future as the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> continues to increase. This may alter the feeding behavior of birds and other insect predators in forest ecosystems. Highlight ID: 11035 BIO/IOS</p>

</span><span  class = "  articleBody text editorContent " data-editor='span'><p>
			While investigating the effects of climate change on nitrogen cycling in temperate coastal systems, 
			Rhode Island researchers made the first scientific link between warming and fundamental changes in 
			nutrient cycles. Researchers found that the observed estuary shifted from acting as a nitrogen filter to 
			acting as a nitrogen source—which has a profoundly negative impact on marine ecological systems. 
			Previously, when denitrification (removal of nitrogen) dominated the cycle, coastal marine sediments 
			cleansed the water of excess nitrogen. When nitrogen fixation, the process of converting nitrogen into 
			a biologically usable form of nitrogen (such as ammonium or nitrate), dominated the cycle, more 
			nitrogen was brought into the system. Researchers discovered that the sediments added more than 1.5 
			times the amount of nitrogen from the land and atmosphere combined. If this process is happening 
			in other places, the sediments can produce large amounts of nitrogen, which could have significant 
			consequences for offshore systems. The investigator who led the research is now examining nitrogen 
			cycling in the Louisiana wetlands to determine whether similar conditions exist.

</span><span  class = "  articleBody text editorContent " data-editor='span'><p>
			EcoPod is a PDA-based mobile capture and access system that enhances the value of observations 
			made by researchers and citizen-scientists—trained volunteers who work on real-world questions—
			around the globe by increasing both the efficiency of the identification process and its reliability. 
			Biological studies rely heavily on large collections of observations of species. For example, changes 
			in the abundance of certain species or the timing of life events, such as flowering time, are critical to 
			understand the effects of urbanization and climate change or the invasion of foreign animal species on 
			local crops. Professional efforts are limited by geography and time. Thus, expanded
			access to easy-touse tools can allow amateurs to make important scientific contributions. Communities of amateurs 
			have yielded key insights, for example, in identifying critical habitat for the Monarch butterfly or 
			changes in bird migration patterns and abundance. The challenge with such contributions is their 
			questionable quality.

			Identification is done by decision trees (graphs of decisions with branches showing alternatives), 
			which are called “keys” in biology. EcoPod technology saves time by soliciting as little information 
			from the user as possible to identify a species. This optimization of minimization is accomplished by 
			continuously analyzing the most discriminating questions to ask the user about the specimen at hand 
			and selecting only the characteristics that can be observed in the field at a given time and location; 
			that is, the system has context awareness. At the same time, EcoPod places no restrictions on the order 
			in which its users enter characteristics they observe. The tool records the results of identifications and

			creates a step-by-step record of the identification process, thereby providing an audit trail for quality 
			assurance. The system also has rapid recovery from mistakes and terminates the process when no 
			additional steps are necessary to make an identification. Users may create and attach written notes and 
			photos to decision points along the way. All of this can be uploaded to large databases, such as eBirds 
			or “Butterflies I’ve Seen,” without additional transcription to Web-forms.

Response to Environmental Cues?</strong></p>
</span><span  class = "  articleBody text editorContent " data-editor='span'><p>			
			Why did daffodils and cherry trees bloom in the middle of January in Washington, D.C., in 
			2007? Will such unseasonable flowering be common in the future as global warming leads to 
			milder winters? If so, how will this seasonal mismatch affect crop yields or the persistence of wild 
			plant populations? To answer such questions, it is important to understand how plants combine 
			information from multiple environmental cues—such as day length, growth temperature and past 
			winter chilling—to flower in favorable seasonal conditions, and how natural genetic differences in 
			responses to these cues allow plants to inhabit diverse geographic regions and respond to ongoing 
			climate change. An interdisciplinary research team, headed by Johanna Schmitt, is studying natural 
			genetic variation in flowering responses in the tiny weed <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> (mouse ear cress). This 
			plant—a close relative of crops such as canola, broccoli, and cabbage—is the principal model used in 
			molecular plant genetics research.

			<em>Arabidopsisis</em> native to Eurasia and present throughout most of North America. Across the native 
			range, the species inhabits a wide range of climates, from Mediterranean to subarctic. To investigate 
			the genetic mechanisms underlying this broad climatic range, the research team is collecting molecular, 
			genetic, and ecological data for sets of plants derived from the different ecological and environmental 
			settings (ecotypes) of <em>A. thaliana</em> across the native geographic ranges. They are testing whether observed 
			DNA variation of the ecotypes is associated with natural geographic differences in flowering responses. 
			At the same time, the team is growing the ecotypes under natural field conditions in different sites 
			in Spain, eastern and western Germany, England, and Finland, in collaboration with seven leading 
			European <em>Arabidopsis</em> researchers, to determine how natural genetic variation in the flowering 
			mechanisms affects performance across the climatic range of the species. 
		</p></span><span  class = "  articleBody text editorContent " data-editor='span'><p>
			Preliminary findings suggest that a natural variant of a single gene can change the entire life cycle 
			of the plant from one that requires winter chilling for flowering and has one generation per year to 
			one that does not require chilling to flower and has several generations per year in regions where the 
			growing season is long and mild. As in the United States, recent winter weather has been unusually 
			warm in Europe, so the team has also had an unexpected opportunity to examine its effects on the 
			flowering and reproductive success of <em>Arabidopsis</em> plants under field conditions, taking detailed 
			measurements of the environmental cues the plants experience in each site. Just like the cherry trees in 
			Washington, many of the experimental plants flowered unexpectedly and unseasonably early, which 
			allowed the team to examine the genetic basis of flowering responses to a warming climate.
		</p></span><span  class = "  articleBody text editorContent " data-editor='span'><p>
			Understanding how natural genetic differences affect flowering patterns in response to environmental 
			cues is an important step in recognizing the overall interplay of environmental influences on genetics. 
			This groundbreaking research could not only advance the understanding of plant genetics and 
			development, but could potentially lead to advances in crop engineering and other pioneering fields.
