				This report addresses some of the major questions facing climate change researchers, and how 
				those puzzles are being addressed by NSF-funded activities. Complex computer models are 
				being developed and refined to predict Earth’s future climate. Observations of climate conditions 
				from observatory networks distributed in Earth’s oceans, polar regions, land masses, and near Earth
				orbit improve the accuracy of the climate models. Records of Earth’s past climate provide 
				important insights into the mechanisms involved in climate cycles of the past, and can help to refine 
				computational models by allowing researchers to simulate past climate. But understanding climate 
				is only part of the story—as we improve our knowledge of how Earth’s climate is changing, we 
				also improve our ability to cope with the impacts of global climate change and variability. Through 
				social, economic, and behavioral science, researchers are learning how human behavior factors into 
				climate change—and how human behavior can be modified to ameliorate our impact on Earth’s 
				climate. Physical scientists and engineers are developing alternative ways of creating, storing, and 
				using energy to reduce the amount of carbon that human activities contribute to the atmosphere. 
				Researchers are also building the scientific foundation for the tools that humanity may need in the 
				future to counteract the effects of global climate change.

				Predicting Earth’s future climate depends on advanced computational hardware, software, and

				involve not only bigger and faster supercomputers, but entirely new computer architectures—e.g. 
				data centers that can process massive amounts of data in parallel—and new devices, including smart 
				sensors, smart phones and robots to acquire data. To make the most effective use of the progress in 
				hardware, reliable, advanced, and intelligent software will be essential. Increasingly sophisticated 
				algorithms, new representations of data, and new programming models and languages are a handful 
				of the types of software advances that will be required. New networking tools will not only connect 
				computers and scientists, they will also be essential to acquiring data from remote sensors and 
				instruments, such as satellites, buoys, and environmental sensor stations. As discussed in the following
