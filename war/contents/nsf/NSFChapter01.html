Climate and weather are the result of atmospheric conditions, which are in a constant state of flux. Atmospheric variables—including air density, temperature, moisture content, wind, chemical composition, and aerosol content, to name a few—combine to determine weather and climate. The interplay among all the components of the climate system makes forecasting future weather and climate no easy task. It’s no coincidence that many of the world’s leading researchers in climate and atmospheric science are experts in chaos theory.</p>

Bright white ice is an excellent solar reflector, sending 75–95 percent of the Sun’s rays back into space. The fraction of reflected solar radiation is called “albedo.” By contrast, land and open water reflect less than 30 percent of the sunlight that falls on them.<sup>34</sup> (See the Icesection for more on albedo.)</p>

					Without life on Earth, the composition of this planet’s atmosphere would be radically different. The

					or remove from the atmosphere. Microorganisms living in the soil of a particular region can also have 
					a significant cumulative effect on the amount of carbon and other chemical compounds given offby 
					the land. Vegetation influences the amount of solar energy absorbed. For example, dark forests absorb

				</p></span><span  class = "  articleBody text editorContent " data-editor='span'><p>
					Plants also influence the cycling of water between land and atmosphere. In terms of land use, the

					carbon, heat, and water with the atmosphere. In the past, climate models have tended to oversimplify 
					the effects of land cover and use; future climate models will need to account for these effects to

				Recent studies have suggested that exposure to 
				air pollution generated by transportation sources 
				is linked to increased health risks in populations 
				living near roadways. The factors responsible 
				for increased health risks remain unclear but 
				are likely to include elevated particulate matter 
				concentrations. In this study, Colorado State 
				University researchers deployed an Aerodyne 
				Research, Inc., Aerosol Mass Spectrometer 
				(AMS), acquired with support from an NSF 
				Major Research Instrumentation Grant, to 
				measure near-roadway particulate matter on 
				the grounds of an elementary school located 
				immediately adjacent to US-95 in Las Vegas, 
				Nevada, in January 2008. The AMS measures, with high-time resolution, the mass concentrations 
				of particles smaller than 1 micron in diameter, a size class strongly linked to adverse health effects. 
				This technology, in combination with measurements of pollutant gases and meteorological variables, 
				offers an unprecedented look at the short-term variations in airborne particulate loadings and 
				composition, and new ways to link these to pollutant sources. Excursions in concentrations of particles 
				rich in organic carbon were associated with increases in traffic during the morning rush hour, but 
				unexpectedly large transient increases in this particle type were also observed in the late evening and

				Snow cover on land during the winter months

				Career Development (CAREER) Program grant 
				recipient Alex Hall of UCLA and colleagues 
				discovered an unexpected link between snowalbedo feedback and climate model predictions 
				of summer climate change in the continental

				NSF-funded project, found that various climate 
				models handle snow albedo differently, causing 
				major differences in the simulation of snowpack. 
				In models with strong snow-albedo feedback, the winter and early spring snowpack is significantly 
				reduced, which leads to water shortages. In turn, these water deficits persist in the modeled soil 
				moisture and allow for more evapotranspiration and warmer temperatures. Hall has determined that 
				by incorporating a more realistic snow-albedo feedback into the climate models, the prediction of U.S. 
				climate could be substantially improved on the decadal to centennial timescale.

				Before this work, snow-albedo feedback was not considered a significant factor affecting the

				which will likely result in new measurements of snow albedo, and a new interest in efforts to model 
				snow cover and snow albedo. Current projections from global climate models are of limited use to 
				policymakers and businesses. Regional climate change modeling in particular is in need of dramatic 
				improvements, and improving climate change predictions on a regional scale will lead to much better

				Scientists are increasingly turning their attention to the study of the possible effects of a

				intensifies when the temperature of the lower levels of the atmosphere increases, as is the case when

				there is an increase in total ozone in the high latitudes of both hemispheres of Earth and a decrease in

</span><span  class = "  articleBody text editorContent " data-editor='span'><p>
				Carbon has always been present in the atmosphere, but in natural amounts it can be absorbed by 
				plants during photosynthesis and returned to the atmosphere by decomposition. Carbon is also 
				absorbed by the ocean, where it rides the ocean conveyor belt for centuries before returning to 
				the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels has interrupted the natural balance of these systems. 
				Researchers have recently developed a computer simulation of the global carbon cycle using a 
				specialized version of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). The models show that excess 
				carbon in the atmosphere leads to warmer temperatures. The increased temperatures dry out land 
				and hinder growth of plants in tropical areas, reducing photosynthesis rates. They also warm ocean 
				surface temperatures and slow the conveyor belt, making it harder for carbon to mix downward into 
				the ocean. These changes result in a positive feedback between the carbon and climate systems, so that 
				climate warming acts to increase the airborne fraction of anthropogenic carbon dioxide and amplify 
				the climate change. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 12620 GEO/ATM</span>

				Heat waves in North America and Europe will

				in Europe and North America. As the pattern 
				becomes more pronounced, severe heat waves 
				occur in the Mediterranean region and the

Characterization Experiment</strong></p>
</span><span  class = "  articleBody text editorContent " data-editor='span'><p>
				To fully understand and model the effects of pollution on climate, researchers must learn more about 
				what, exactly, is contained in the pollution. James Anderson and colleagues collected samples of 
				atmospheric aerosols during the Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-Asia) in spring 2001. 
				The objective of this major international field project was to characterize aerosols in the Northwest 
				Pacific region and to understand their impact on the radiative budget in the region. The researchers 
				collected aerosols from both air- and ground-based collection sites, then analyzed the samples using 
				automated scanning electron microscopy and manual transmission electron microscopy. The analysis 
				provided detailed information about particle composition, size distribution, shapes, and state of 
				mixing. Information on shapes and mixing state is very difficult to obtain by any other method, yet it 
				is crucially important to correctly determine the role of aerosols in the regional climate. 
			</p></span><span  class = "  articleBody text editorContent " data-editor='span'><p>
				Perhaps the most important finding is the variety of the East Asian pollution particles, even from samples 
				not mixed with urban pollution. The dust mineralogy and size and shape distributions have a variability 
				that is probably due to the pollution originating in different regions and having different transport 
				histories. Aggregation of mineral particles is common, and the variable degree of aggregation affects both 
				size and shape distributions. A very wide range of shape distributions means that simplifying assumptions 
				in lieu of observations used in modeling optical properties are not valid. Once the dust mixes with urban 
				pollution, several additional consequences ensue. Perhaps the most important consequence for climate 
				change is the common aggregation of black carbon with mineral dust, as this causes the aggregate to 
				absorb light (most aerosol particles only scatter sunlight). The investigators also observed a number 
				of other complex particle interactions that must be taken into account to adequately understand the 
				pollution’s interaction with sunlight. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 1361 GEO/ATM</span>

				Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="subscript">2</span>) emissions from the

				to a team of scientists from the National

				confirms recent satellite observations showing

				density in the thermosphere reduces the drag

				Carbon dioxide cools the thermosphere but warms the atmosphere near Earth’s surface (the 
				troposphere). This paradox occurs because the atmosphere thins with height. Near Earth’s surface, 
				CO<span class="subscript">2</span> absorbs radiation escaping Earth, but before the gas
				molecules can radiate the energy to space, 
				collisions with other molecules in the dense lower atmosphere force the
				CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				molecule to release energy 
				as heat, thus warming the air. In the much thinner thermosphere, a
				CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				molecule absorbs energy 
				when it collides with an oxygen molecule, but there is ample time for it to radiate energy to space 
				before another collision occurs. The result is a cooling effect. As it cools, the thermosphere settles, so 
				that the density at a given height is reduced. Also affecting the thermosphere is the 11-year cycle of 
				solar activity. During the active phase of the cycle, ultraviolet light and energetic particles from the Sun 
				increase, producing a warming and expansion of the upper atmosphere. When solar activity wanes, the 
				thermosphere settles and cools.

				activities. The team used a prediction that calls for a stronger than usual solar cycle over the next decade. 
				The model showed a decrease in thermospheric density from 1970 to 2000 of 1.7 percent per decade, 
				or about 5 percent overall, which agrees with observations. The team found that the decrease was about 
				three to four times more rapid during solar minimum than solar
