				Snow and ice factor into Earth’s climate in a 
				number of important ways. The amount of 
				land-based ice determines global sea level—the 
				geological record shows that higher sea levels 
				occurred during “greenhouse Earth” periods 
				in the past. The reflectivity, or albedo, of 
				snow and ice introduces climate sensitivity, 
				particularly in Earth’s polar regions; as ice 
				disappears, less solar energy is reflected away and more is absorbed, heating the surface, which causes the 
				remaining ice to become more susceptible to melting. Ice also plays an important role in the circulation 
				and currents of the world’s ocean, because the formation and melting of sea ice affects the temperature 
				and salinity of the surrounding seawater, which are important factors driving global ocean circulation 
				(see Seasection). Snow and ice at high elevations at temperate and even tropical latitudes affect local 
				ecosystems and regulate local climate. Throughout the world, human drinking water supplies depend on 
				reliable and predictable patterns of glacial accumulation and thaw, which are threatened by alterations in 
				global temperature and weather patterns. High-altitude glaciers around the world face uncertain futures. 
				They also serve as powerful visual illustrations of a changing climate, as historical photographs reveal the 
				dramatic extent to which many of them have receded. In some cases, they’ve already disappeared.

					Understanding the Greenland ice sheet is essential to predicting sea-level rise. Three main factors

					precipitation, melting, and the flow of ice into the sea. In the past, Greenland’s ice sheet was in an 
					equilibrium state in which the amount of annual accumulation of snow roughly equaled the amount 
					of snow and ice lost to melting and ice flow. Thus, Greenland’s ice mass neither contributed to nor 
					took away from the global sea level. In recent years, however, the amounts of melt water and frozen 
					ice flowing into the sea have increased substantially. Warmer temperatures have also led to increased 
					precipitation (as warm air holds more moisture), but the increase in precipitation does not offset

As evidence continues to point to the poles as both drivers and harbingers of global climate change, NSF-funded researchers are accelerating their efforts to collect data and perform research in these often inhospitable and remote areas. Polar regions offer unusual opportunities for environmental research because the polar ecosystem is sensitive to small changes in climate, rendering them important bellwethers for potential change, and because the polar regions provide information about how organisms—and the people whose livelihood and culture rely on them—adapt to environmental change.<sup>7</sup> In the Arctic, average temperatures have risen at almost twice the rate as the rest of the world in the past few decades. Widespread melting of sea ice, glaciers, and permafrost provide dramatic evidence of the effects of rising temperatures across this region.<sup>8</sup> Meanwhile, Antarctica contains some of the most poorly understood glaciers on the planet, and field research in the Antarctic is vital to improving our ability to predict how rising temperatures will affect Earth’s most massive ice sheet.</p>

				When it comes to massive ice sheets, one of the most difficult questions to answer

				complicated because the underlying crust is rising, making even the most precise

				Snow and ice are important influences in global climate. Earth’s polar regions are experiencing swift 
				and dramatic changes as a result of global climate change, with melting permafrost and rapidly 
				shrinking sea- and land-based ice sheets being some of the most visible changes. The ancient ice 
				reserves on Antarctica and Greenland store accumulated climate data that can help us forecast Earth’s 
				climate future; ironically, these stored records may be in danger of being lost because of the rapid 
				warming, particularly in Greenland. The highlights that follow contain descriptions of some of the 
				many research projects funded by NSF on snow and ice research. Many of the projects are connected 
				with the IPY program and involve partnerships with researchers from around the world. These research 
				efforts not only contribute to our current understanding of Earth’s ice and snow, they also provide 
				critical field experience and training for the next generation of glaciologists, paleoclimatologists, and 
				geoscientists who will continue to monitor the cryosphere.

				Ice plays an important role in both the current climate and the climates of the past, influencing
				the amount of solar radiation reflected back to space, the exchange of heat between the polar ocean
				and the atmosphere, the amount of freshwater entering the ocean, and, indirectly, the strength of
				the global ocean’s overturning circulation. Ice can be difficult for researchers to characterize,
				however, because it can exhibit different thermal behaviors, which depend on variables such as the
				number and size of air bubbles within it. Sea ice is a particularly complicated and dynamic porous
				composite of solid ice, brine, and gases. The microstructure of the ice depends on the temperature
				of the ice, the pressure to which it is subjected, and its history. Since the dynamics of climate
				depend strongly on land and sea ice, good models of the properties of ice are important for accurate

				The International Trans Antarctic Scientific

				Antarctica and the adjacent Southern Ocean. 
				ITASE, a 20-nation consortium, is developing 
				a continent-wide array of annually resolved, 
				instrumentally calibrated records of past climates 
				(temperature, net mass-balance, atmospheric 
				circulation, chemistry of the atmosphere, and 
				forcing) covering the past 200–1,000 years. The 
				initial phase of the U.S. contribution to ITASE 
				(US ITASE) concentrated on West Antarctica. 
				During the 2006–2008 austral field seasons, 
				US ITASE planned to extend its traverses into 
				East Antarctica. Several key results have emerged 
				from the West Antarctic phase of US ITASE. 
				Temperatures are still within the range of natural variability of the past 200 years, exclusive of the 
				Antarctic Peninsula, and are closely associated with changes in major atmospheric circulation patterns. 
				Mass balance variability is primarily controlled by surface/bed topography, with significant variability 
				in regions displaying large gradients in topography. Initial phases of the inland migration of marine air 
				masses can be detected along the Amundsen Sea coast. A significant portion of the natural variability 
				in the strength of the westerlies surrounding Antarctica is attributed to decadal and longer scales of 
				solar variability that affect the production of ozone and, as a consequence, the thermal gradient over 
				Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 11564 OPP/ANT</span>

				Winter lasts nearly three-quarters of the year 
				in the Arctic, yet relatively few scientific 
				studies have been carried out in the Arctic 
				winter because of the significant challenges of 
				conducting scientific research in the extreme 
				cold and dark. Even access to automated 
				measures of environmental parameters has 
				been limited owing to a lack of continuous 
				power and communications at major field sites. 
				Recently, scientists have increasingly recognized 
				the compelling need for winter studies, despite 
				the logistical challenges. Important issues that 
				can only be addressed by winter studies include 
				(1) understanding the radiation balance in 
				the winter and how it is changing, which is 
				essential to understanding climate change in 
				the Arctic; (2) understanding the role of snow and ground temperatures in overwinter carbon and 
				nitrogen cycling, which affects summer growth of vegetation and feedback of greenhouse gases to the 
				atmosphere (one of the principal ways that the Arctic affects global climate); and (3) understanding 
				how animals and plants survive extreme winter conditions and how these adaptations may constrain 
				their response to changing environmental conditions. Although many biological processes are slower 
				in the winter because of low temperatures, microbes, plants, and animals continue to be active 
				through the long winter night, and their activities establish a legacy that affects summer processes. 
				For example, overwinter decomposition by soil microbes sets the conditions for summer uptake of 
				nutrients and growth by plants.

				In September 2007, the extent of sea ice in 
				the Arctic Ocean was 23 percent less than the 
				previous record set in 2005. Results from an 
				array of buoys, deployed as part of the Arctic 
				Observing Network, showed an extraordinarily 
				large amount of bottom melting in the 
				Beaufort Sea associated with this retreat. This 
				observation indicates that local melting of sea 
				ice was largely the result of excess heat in the 
				ocean’s surface waters, not excess heat in the 
				atmosphere. A synthesis of satellite observations 
				and weather forecast data is consistent with 
				this conclusion. The conditions in the Beaufort 
				Sea—more open water leading to more solar heat 
				absorbed, resulting in more melting and more open water—is a classic ice-albedo feedback signature.

				We know that the area and thickness of the 
				Arctic sea ice cover has been decreasing over the 
				past few decades. What about the Antarctic? The

				way as it is in the Arctic. Some reports have 
				even suggested that increases of ice in areas of 
				the Antarctic signal that global warming is a 
				hoax. As in the Arctic, the Antarctic sea ice cover 
				is affected by a complex combination of solar 
				heating and atmospheric pressure patterns and 
				ocean currents. Unlike the Arctic, until now at 
				least, Antarctic sea ice largely disappears on a 
				seasonal basis. The total amount of Antarctic 
				sea ice in a given year doesn’t seem to be changing dramatically, but there have been big changes 
				in particular regions. Previous studies have shown pronounced contrasting trends in annual sea 
				duration and monthly concentration in two regions of the Southern Ocean: decreases in the western

				Antarctic Peninsula and southern Bellingshausen Sea, and increases in the Western Ross Sea region. 
				The recent analysis of satellite observations from 1979–2004 shows that sea ice is retreating a month 
				earlier and advancing a month and a half later in the former region and retreating a month later and 
				advancing a month earlier in the latter region. These trends are strongly correlated with changes in 
				atmospheric pressure patterns. A simple way to think about it is that there is a recurrent band of low 
				pressure or “storminess” that affects the sea ice edge, particularly during spring and fall. Larger scale 
				pressure systems push this band of low pressure around. When these larger scale systems are analyzed 
				statistically, it appears that there is a hemispheric pressure pattern that changes on timescales of decades 
				and is periodically perturbed by El Niño/La Niña climate patterns. Ozone losses and greenhouse 
				gases—both of which affect Earth’s interaction with sunlight—are thought to be driving changes in 
				the Southern Hemisphere pressure patterns connected to the sea ice changes. On the basis of current 
				understanding, continued greenhouse gas release would be expected to reinforce and perhaps expand 
				these regional ice trends to larger areas. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 16777 OPP/ANT</span>

				lies at the base of alpine-type glaciers, the tongues of ice that literally connect the ocean to the ice caps. 
				It is the ability of these glaciers to slide that enables the ice caps to rejoin the ocean, causing the sea 
				level to rise. Scientists from the University of Colorado at Boulder (UCB) have provided some of the 
				first real-time sequences of glacial sliding and have demonstrated that the key to accelerations in glacial 
				velocity is the dynamics of the basal plumbing system and the availability of melt water. Graduate 
				student Tim Bartholomaus and his mentors from UCB have assembled high-resolution velocity, 
				surface uplift, temperature, water pressure, and outlet water discharge data on the Kennicott Glacier in 
				Alaska. These data reveal the intimate connection between water pressure and glacier sliding velocity, 
				and enable Earth scientists to quantify the role of the subglacial plumbing system that at one moment 
				provides safe passage for melt water and at another is overwhelmed and overpressured and enables 
				rapid glacial sliding. Sea-level rise is linked to this dynamic behavior because the rate at which these 
				glacial tongues slide will determine the principal rate at which ice mass is lost and, thus, the rate at 
				which sea level will rise over the next few decades
				and centuries. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 16095 GEO/EAR</span>

				As Earth gets warmer, we look to the geologic

				become. The last time Earth transitioned 
				from a glacial world like the present one to 
				a “greenhouse world” (free of ice) was more 
				than 250 million years ago. NSF researchers 
				document the change using three lines of 
				evidence: (1) chemical information that can 
				tell us past temperatures; (2) fossil evidence of 
				land plants; and (3) hard evidence from rocks 
				in Antarctica that indicate whether or not there 
				were ice sheets there at that time.

				The results tell us two important things. First, 
				atmospheric carbon dioxide content, global 
				temperatures, and ice sheet occurrences are 
				strongly correlated. This finding gives further 
				credence to the idea that anthropogenic increases 
				in atmospheric carbon dioxide will have major 
				effects on global climate. Second, plants respond to climate change in a geologic instant. Europe went 
				from warm, wet forests to dry, cold pine forests and then back again right along with climate change. 
				All this was also accompanied by plant evolution.

				This research suggests that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, in addition to hotter

				A new research study challenges the generally

				not have existed on Earth during past superwarm climate events. Researchers at Scripps 
				Institution of Oceanography at the University 
				of California-San Diego conducted the study, 
				supported by the NSF-funded Integrated Ocean 
				Drilling Program and the German Research 
				Foundation. The study provides strong evidence 
				that a glacial ice cap, about half the size of the 
				modern-day glacial ice sheet, existed 91 million 
				years ago during a period of intense global 
				warming. The study examines chemical and 
				sea-level data retrieved from marine microfossils 
				deposited on the ocean floor 91 million years 
				ago during a period known as the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum. This extreme warming event 
				in Earth’s history raised tropical ocean temperatures to 35–37 degrees Celsius (95–98.6 degrees 
				Fahrenheit), about 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than today, thus creating an 
				intense greenhouse climate. It is likely that an ice sheet about 50–60 percent the size of the modern 
				Antarctic ice cap existed for about 200,000 years, demonstrating that even the super-warm climates 
				of the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum were not warm enough to prevent ice growth. The presence

				closely with peers and faculty mentors, design their own research questions, 
				collect field data, and formulate science hypotheses and conclusions during

				Arctic sea ice has retreated in recent years, especially in the late summer, when ice thickness and 
				area are at a minimum. To analyze how global warming will affect the ice in coming decades, the 
				team studied a series of seven simulations run on the NCAR-based Community Climate System 
				Model (CCSM), one of the world’s leading tools for studying climate change. Having first tested 
				the model to show that it closely matched observations of ice cover since 1870, the team simulated

				atmosphere at the current rate, the Arctic’s future ice cover will go through periods of relative stability 
				followed by abrupt retreat. The research pointed to several reasons for the abrupt loss of ice in a 
				gradually warming world. Open water absorbs more sunlight than does ice, meaning that the growing 
				regions of ice-free water will accelerate the warming trend. In addition, global climate change is

				Laidre’s research addresses questions concerning the vulnerability of Arctic cetaceans to climate change. 
				The Arctic is currently experiencing dramatic changes in sea ice characteristics and marine productivity, 
				which will have cascading effects on Arctic food webs. Three species of cetaceans (narwhal, beluga, 
				and bowhead whale) inhabit the Arctic waters of West Greenland and are ideal indicator organisms 
				for monitoring ongoing biophysical changes affected by a warming climate. Arctic cetaceans’ seasonal 
				movements, distribution, resource selection, and life history parameters are tightly linked with changes 
				in the Arctic environment, making them both vulnerable to climate alterations and good indicators of 
				cumulative changes.

				The main purpose of the project has been to contrast Arctic species inhabiting different ecological

				production in focal areas using satellite telemetry data on whale movements and diving behavior and 
				remotely sensed environmental data. This information has been used to examine resource selection 
				and differential vulnerability using quantitative spatial modeling techniques. Results of this work have 
				facilitated the understanding of the potential effects of climate change on High Arctic top predators 
				and the sustainability of their exploitation by Inuit communities, linking scientific discovery to societal
