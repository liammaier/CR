Sea currents and surface temperature drive weather patterns and create the climate. Evaporation from the sea surface accounts for most of the precipitation that falls on Earth. The ocean&rsquo;s ability to absorb and store energy allows it to serve as a buffer against extreme climatic swings. And, importantly, the ocean has an enormous capacity to remove carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from the atmosphere; researchers estimate that the oceans have absorbed roughly one-third of the anthropogenic carbon released into the air.</p>

Unraveling the role of the ocean in the cycling of carbon in the Earth system has been a challenge for NSF researchers. The ocean contains about 50 times as much CO<sub>2</sub> as the atmosphere. Even slight changes in the marine carbon cycle can substantially influence the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> contributing to the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere. Researchers have found evidence that the marine carbon cycle was a significant factor in transitions to and from past ice ages.3 Modelers need to know how much anthropogenic carbon the ocean can absorb.

Warmer, saltier waters from the Atlantic penetrate the Arctic Ocean beneath layers of colder water, which lie atop the warmer waters and act as a barrier, preventing them from melting sea ice. Once in the Arctic, this water is cooled as it travels cyclonically (counterclockwise) around the perimeter as a boundary current, finally exiting Fram Strait as a colder, fresher water mass.

				The Brown team took advantage of new organic geochemical methods to determine past sea surface 
				temperatures. They extracted alkenones—molecules synthesized by a class of marine algae—from a 
				long deep-sea core recovered by the Ocean Drilling Program just south of the equator in the Eastern 
				Pacific. Quantifying the ratio of two dominant alkenones allowed the investigators to determine past 
				temperatures at the sea surface with high precision. The same sediment core also held clues to past ice 
				ages, in the form of oxygen isotope ratios of bottom-dwelling foraminifera (single-celled organisms 
				that make a carbonate shell). Because the bottom waters of the Pacific ultimately come from the 
				high latitudes of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, comparing the alkenone data (surface 
				conditions) with the benthic isotope data allowed the Brown group to directly compare the response of 
				an important tropical zone to the evolution of the ice ages at high latitudes. A principal finding of the 
				Brown study is that the EEP has cooled rather steadily over the past 5 million years, at a rate of about 1 
				degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) per million years. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 12938 GEO/OCE</span>

				An international team of research scientists on NSF-funded Integrated Ocean Drilling Program 
				(IODP) Expedition 311 set out to learn how gas hydrates are formed. The science party used the 
				U.S. research drilling vessel <em>JOIDES Resolutionon</em> a 43-day expedition in fall 2005. Gas hydrate, a 
				largely frozen natural gas, is very important because it contains methane, a significant greenhouse 
				gas. Gas hydrate is also a potentially important energy resource. Gas hydrate deposits are typically 
				found below the seafloor in offshore locations where water depths exceed 500 meters (1,600 feet) 
				and in Arctic permafrost regions. Contrary to established expectations of how gas hydrate deposits 
				form, Expedition 311 scientists—led by Michael Riedel of McGill University, Montreal, and Timothy 
				Collett of the United States Geological Survey—found unusually high concentrations of gas hydrate 
				at relatively shallow depths: 50–120 meters (160–400 feet) below the seafloor. The lower pressure 
				stability of gas hydrates means that they may be more accessible for mining, but they are also more 
				easily released from sediments during seafloor landslides triggered by earthquakes, which are common 
				in the geologically active area known as the (northern) Cascadia Margin near the coast of the Pacific 
				Northwest, where the study took place. In addition, because methane is a greenhouse gas that 
				contributes to global warming, and warming oceans may be a prime cause of “melting” of seafloor gas 
				hydrates, there is a potential positive feedback: Warming oceans lead to more methane release, which

			</p></span><span  class = "  articleBody text editorContent " data-editor='span'><p>
				Fluctuations in the NPGO are driven by the same fundamental processes that control salinity and

				in the winds that cause coastal upwelling, the process by which subsurface cold water that is rich in 
				nutrients is brought up to the surface. These results strongly support the use of the NPGO as the 
				primary indicator of upwelling strength and nutrient fluxes, and, therefore, the potential for ecosystem 
				change in the California Current System region. Changes in nutrient fluxes drive fluctuations in 
				modeled chlorophyll concentration—an indicator of phytoplankton concentration—that are highly 
				correlated to observed chlorophyll. The model simulations support the hypothesis that variations in 
				phytoplankton biomass in the California Current System region are primarily driven by changes in 
				wind-driven upwelling correlated with the NPGO. The NPGO thus provides a strong indicator of 
				changes in the mechanisms driving oceanic ecosystem dynamics.

				This “bottom-up” forcing is consistent with previous fish catch data and satellite-derived chlorophyll

				NPGO pattern extends beyond the North Pacific and is part of a global mode of climate variability 
				that is evident in global sea-level trends and sea surface temperature. The amplification of the

One of the great mysteries surrounding Earth&rsquo;s emergence from the last ice age, which occurred between 19,000 and 11,000 years ago, is the rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub> ) that occurred as the glacial ice sheets melted. Scientists have known that during this time, the carbon-14 (<sup>14</sup>C, an unstable isotope of carbon) content of the atmosphere fell by approximately 35 percent. The current hypothesis for this radiocarbon conundrum&mdash;the rapid rise in the level of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> as the 14C content of the atmosphere fell&mdash;is that a large reservoir of deep ocean water with accumulated CO<sub>2</sub> suddenly reached the surface and released CO<sub>2</sub>. The stored CO<sub>2</sub> molecules would have been isolated from the atmosphere for thousands of years (which would decrease its <sup>14</sup>C level), thereby giving CO<sub>2</sub> in the postglacial atmosphere the appearance of being older (because it contained less <sup>14</sup>C).</p>

The researchers propose that during the deglaciation, a deep reservoir of old water spread northward from the Southern Ocean via the Antarctic Intermediate Water Current. When this old, CO<sub>2</sub>-rich, 14C-depleted water surfaced along the Baja coast and elsewhere, the excess dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> in the water left the ocean. This had the effect of reducing the atmosphere&rsquo;s radiocarbon content and contributed to the rapid CO<sub>2</sub>rise in the atmosphere, as documented in high-latitude ice cores.

				Oceanographers participating in the NSFfunded Eddies Dynamics, Mixing, Export, 
				and Species composition (EDDIES) study 
				have demonstrated that episodic, eddy-driven 
				upwelling—in which ocean surface waters are 
				replaced by water that comes up from below—
				may supply a significant fraction of the nutrients 
				required to sustain primary productivity in the 
				subtropical ocean. The importance of ocean 
				eddies (circular, rotating bodies of ocean water 
				with warm or cold water cores) in stimulating 
				ocean productivity through the enhanced 
				upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water to the 
				surface had been speculated for over a decade. 
				Large areas of the ocean, such as the central 
				subtropical North Atlantic, are characterized by 
				low productivity, largely because phytoplankton 
				growth is limited by the delivery of plant 
				nutrients to the sunlit surface zone. Nevertheless, 
				productivity in these regions is higher than expected based on current knowledge of ocean mixing 
				processes. In 2004 and 2005, EDDIES researchers sampled 10 different ocean eddies in the Northern 
				Atlantic Ocean. Two different types—a “cyclone” eddy (counterclockwise rotating with density surfaces 
				pushed up in the center in a dome shape) and a “mode-water” eddy (clockwise rotating with a thick 
				lens of constant density water below the surface)—were sampled repeatedly. The different types have 
				distinct surface signatures that allow researchers to use remote sensing techniques to locate them, then 
				tag and track them by releasing surface drifters in their core. This sophisticated approach allowed the 
				researchers to sample the eddies and their evolution in great detail over 2 months, tracking them using 
				two research vessels and employing high-tech instrumentation, such as a video plankton recorder, 
				acoustic doppler current profiler, conductivity, temperature, depth recorders, and a tracer that directly 
				measured the horizontal and vertical dispersion of water properties such as temperature, salinity, and 
				plankton concentration.
			</p></span><span  class = "  articleBody text editorContent " data-editor='span'><p>
				The main result of this study is that the interactions of cyclone and mode-water eddies with the wind 
				result in very different biological responses. The eddy-wind interactions enhance the vertical supply of 
				nutrients in mode-water eddies by moving surface water away from the center of the eddy. The result 
				is sustained primary biological production at the surface and the creation of subsurface maxima in 
				phytoplankton and zooplankton communities. In contrast, the biological production in cyclones is 
				more ephemeral because of a reverse effect of the wind interacting with cyclones. These results explain 
				how higher than expected production can be achieved in mid-ocean regions and points to the need to 
				include explicit representations of eddy-wind interactions and response in future ocean and climate

				In 2006, NSF awarded a grant to support a new Science and Technology Center for Coastal Margin 
				Observation and Prediction (CMOP). The mission of the CMOP is to study coastal margins using 
				observation and prediction technologies to facilitate long-term integrated descriptions and analyses 
				of coastal margin physics, chemistry, and biology. CMOP will enable researchers to focus on novel 
				technological and scientific opportunities to answer major questions about the impact of climate on 
				coastal margins, the role of coastal margins on global elemental cycles, and the seaward extent of human 
				impacts. This work, focused on the Columbia River, will lead to transformative understanding of critical

				Of the many documented effects of global 
				climate change, the bleaching of corals—a 
				stress response caused by elevated seawater 
				temperature in which corals lose their 
				nutrient-providing symbiotic algae (called 
				zooxanthellae)—continues to attract the interest 
				of coral reef biologists around the world. Recent 
				research conducted by Andrea Grottoli from 
				Ohio State University at the Hawaii Institute 
				for Marine Biology has revealed that when 
				certain corals bleach, they can continue to 
				survive by consuming zooplankton from the 
				surrounding seawater.
			</p></span><span  class = "  articleBody text editorContent " data-editor='span'><p>
				While corals have long been known to consume 
				zooplankton, some species of coral appear to be able to survive bleaching by increasing their rates of 
				feeding to compensate for the loss of food normally supplied by the zooxanthellae when these cells 
				reside safely in their coral host. Grottoli and her group made this discovery by conducting feeding 
				and physiological studies on three species of coral found on reefs in Hawaii. An often-noted effect 
				of coral bleaching is that corals with a mounding shape or morphology are more likely to survive a 
				bleaching event than those with a branching morphology. The study found that one of these species, 
				the branching coral <em>Montipora capitata</em>, exhibited the greatest increase in feeding on zooplankton after 
				bleaching and recovered faster as well, but another branching species, <em>Porites compressa</em>, did not. 
			</p></span><span  class = "  articleBody text editorContent " data-editor='span'><p>
				The implications of these results are that predicting coral survival or recovery on the basis of 
				morphology does have exceptions, and many species of coral may be able to survive the repeated 
				effects of thermal stress and bleaching by increasing their feeding rates. Increased feeding in the face 
				of continuing environmental stress depends on the availability of zooplankton in the water, which 
				may also be affected by the very same thermal
				stress events that cause corals to bleach. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 13490 GEO/OCE</span>

More Signs of Global Climate Change</strong></p>
</span><span  class = "  articleBody text editorContent " data-editor='span'><p>
				Tropical ocean waters have become dramatically saltier over the past 40 years, while oceans closer 
				to Earth’s poles have become fresher. These large-scale, relatively rapid oceanic changes suggest that 
				recent climate changes, including global warming, may be altering the fundamental planetary system 
				that regulates evaporation and precipitation and cycles freshwater around the globe. The study, led by 
				Ruth Curry of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), provides direct evidence that 
				the global water cycle is intensifying. This result is consistent with global warming hypotheses that 
				suggest ocean evaporation will increase as Earth’s temperature does. By comparing recent and historical 
				salinity observations, the investigators observed that surface waters in tropical and subtropical Atlantic 
				Ocean regions have become markedly saltier. Simultaneously, much of the water column in the high 
				latitudes of the North and South Atlantic became fresher. This trend appears to have accelerated in the 
				years since 1990, when 10 of the warmest years occurred since records began in 1861. The scientists 
				estimated that net evaporation rates over the tropical Atlantic have increased by 5 percent to 10 percent 
				over the past four decades. These findings are particularly significant as pressure on freshwater resources 
				has become critical in many areas around the world. An acceleration of Earth’s global water cycle can 
				potentially affect global precipitation patterns that govern the distribution, severity, and frequency of 
				droughts, floods, and storms. It would also exacerbate global warming by rapidly adding more water 
				vapor—itself a potent, heat-trapping greenhouse gas—to the atmosphere. And it could continue to 
				freshen North Atlantic Ocean waters to a point that could disrupt ocean circulation and trigger further 
				climate changes. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 8053/ Press Release 03-145 GEO/OCE</span>
