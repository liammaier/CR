					<div class="intro-text">
						<p><strong>A well-known joke</strong> tells of a man out for an evening walk. He meets a drunk who is on his hands and knees under a streetlight."What are you doing?" asks the man. "Looking for my car key," replies the drunk. "You lost it here?" asks the man in conversation as he begins to help look. "No, I dropped it by the tavern." "Then why are you looking over here?" "The light's better," the drunk replies. The joke lampoons a principle&mdash;the best place to look for something is where it's likely to be found&mdash;that is key to finding information.</p>
						<p>In this chapter we discuss searching for information and evaluating its accuracy. To find anything, we have to look where it's likely to be found. Historically, libraries have housed well-organized archives, collections, and other information resources that are good places to look. Now many of those resources are available online, so we can update the "visit the library" advice: Log in to the library. To find what we're looking for, we must also understand the hierarchical organization of information. Hierarchy speeds searching, and recognizing hierarchies when we see them helps us find information faster. Of course, using a computer to search greatly extends our reach, so we also need to understand how search engines work, how they organize the information they store, and how to interpret search results. If we are going to use search engines effectively, we need to ask the right questions, which is as important as looking in the right place. But finding information and finding truthful, accurate, insightful information are two different things. So we must be aware that deceptive information lurks on the Internet and learn to recognize accurate sources. Finally, we test our understanding by deciding whether information on a Web page is true or false.</p>

				<h2>Searching in All the Right Places</h2>
				
				<p><span class="first-sentence">Ask a reference librarian where to find a <em>Scientific American</em>&ndash;type article on black holes and the reply will always be "<em>Scientific American</em>."</span> Yet many of us ask questions like that because we don't think about where to look for the information we want. Reference librarians do think about it, and we can learn from them and become better information gatherers. That's important because on the Web we don't have a librarian's help. The key to finding information is to think logically and creatively.</p>

					<h3>The Obvious and Familiar</h3>
					
					<p><span class="first-sentence">If we're going to "look in the right place," we need to know where the information we want can be found.</span> Like <em>Scientific American</em>, many sources are obvious and familiar if we think about it:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>To find tax information, ask the federal (IRS) or state tax office.</li>
						
						<li>
							To find the direction to Dover from London, look at a map of the United Kingdom.
						</li>
						
						<li>To find out how many shares of IBM stock are outstanding, check the company's annual report.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						Many of the answers we want to find have an obvious source, so we can simply guess the
						online address: <code>www.irs.gov</code>, <code>www.mapquest.com</code>, and <code>www.ibm.com</code>, respectively.
					</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="3" data-name="Libraries Online">
					
					<h3>Libraries Online</h3>
					
					<p><span class="first-sentence">One advantage that research librarians have over most of us is that they know about many more information sources than we do.</span> Their advantage can be our advantage if we use libraries. Libraries remain substantial information resources despite the growth of the Internet. Most college libraries and many large public libraries let you access not only the online catalog of their own collections, but also many other information resources. These libraries are just a "click away."</p>
					
					<p>For example, the University of Washington's Libraries site, <code>www.lib.washington.edu</code>, opens with an inviting page presenting a series of links to online information resources (see Figure 5.1(a)). You can search in the UW catalog or a large number of other collections. In the Find It menu, clicking on the Article & Research Databases link transports you to a new page linking to hundreds of databases (see Figure 5.1(b)). Many of these resources are commercial databases that UW subscribes to, so only UW students and faculty can use them. However, your library probably gives you access to similar collections. Checking these sources is a quick and easy way to find information.</p>
					
					<p>In addition to linking to these huge database resources, UW's librarians have helped us even more. At the bottom of the Articles & Research Databases page (Figure 5.1(b)) is the section "Starting points for research by subject."</p>

					</figure>
					
					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">128</div>
					
					<p>These are topic-specific pages that the librarians have set up. They bring together many of the library's resources on specific topics. Clicking on Cinema Studies, we see a page devoted specifically to that topic (see Figure 5.1(c)). And a little down this page is the link for "Cinema Studies e-journals, A&ndash;Z." In three clicks we can begin to poke around the archives on the exact topic of interest to us.</p>
					
					<p>The point is not that UW's librarians have done an especially nice job, though I think they have, but that libraries in general provide many online facilities that are well organized and trustworthy. For example, the Chicago Public Library, <code>www.chipublib.org</code>, lists similar resources on its Books, Movies And More > Online Research page, and the Library of Congress, <code>www.loc.gov/library/</code>, has huge online collections and services for Internet users. These resources are free and open to everyone. So, to find out information, go (electronically) to the library.</p>

					<h3>Pre-Digital Information</h3>
					
					<p><span class="first-sentence">The online digital library is not yet a substitute for going to the physical library and checking out traditional paper books and journals.</span> Despite the billions of Web pages and digital documents, most of the <em>valuable information typically found in a library is not online.</em> Most of humankind's pre&ndash;1985 knowledge is not yet digitized. And in some cases where paper documents have been digitized, the online version is missing footnotes, references, and appendices, has unreadable equations, or is in other ways incomplete. So, while the best place to begin your research is at the online library, don't be surprised if the information you need is not yet digitally available.</p>

			<section class="section" data-number="5" data-name="How Is Information Organized?"> <!-- section2 -->
				
				<h2>How Is Information Organized?</h2>
				
				<p><span class="first-sentence">To help us find information, librarians, archivists, Web-page designers, and others who organize collections of information give the collections a structure to make them easier to search.</span> The process is simple: All of the information is grouped into a small number of categories, each of which is easily described. This is the top-level <em>classification</em>. Then, the information in each category is also divided into a few subcategories, each with a simple description. These are the second-level classifications (see Figure 5.2). Those subcategories are also divided into still smaller categories with brief descriptions, the third-level classifications. And on and on. Eventually, the classifications become small enough that it's possible to look through the whole category to find the information you need.</p>
				
				<p>For example, a source of information about radio stations in the U.S. that carry National Public Radio might use their geographical region as its top-level classification, making the top-level categories:</p>
				<blockquote>Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, North Central, South Central, Mountain, Pacific</blockquote>
			
				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">129</div>
			
				<figure>
				
					<img src="/contents/fluency/images/figure5.2.png">
					
					<figcaption><span class="figureId">Figure 5.2</span> Top-level, second-level, and third-level classifications of a collection.</figcaption>
			
				</figure>
			
				<p>Within each region, the second-level classification might use the state, making the Pacific category's subcategories:</p>
				
				<blockquote>Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington</blockquote>
				
				<p>The third-level categories could be large cities with multiple public radio stations in populous states like California. When the final classification is small enough&mdash;Hawaii has only four public radio stations&mdash;no finer classification is needed.</p>
				
				<p>There are several important properties of classifications.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>The descriptive terms must cover all of the information in the category and be easy for a searcher to apply. The breakdown of regions by country, state, and city has this property.</li>
					<li>The subcategories do not all have to use the same classification. So, the Pacific category could be categorized by states and the Northeast could be categorized by cities.</li>
					<li>The information in the category defines how best to classify it.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>This structure is called a hierarchy. As with the directory hierarchy we discussed in Chapter 3, it is a natural way to organize information. Remember that hierarchies are often drawn as trees. One very famous hierarchy is the "tree of life," the biological taxonomy of organisms. It is too large to display as a tree, but Table 5.1 shows the layers of classification for human beings, from the top-level (highest) classification&mdash;kingdom&mdash;to the last (lowest)&mdash;species. Because hierarchies are a logical way to organize information, we find them</p>

				<p>everywhere. And because they are so intuitive, we don't often consciously notice them. Our goal for the rest of this section is to recognize hierarchies when we see them because being aware of them speeds up our information discovery.</p>
				
				<div class="fluency-bit"><strong class="fluency-bit-title">Choose to Exclude.</strong>Hierarchies work well not because of what we choose, but because of what we don't choose. For example, suppose a collection has a million items divided into 10 (roughly) equal-size categories. Picking a category eliminates from consideration the 900,000 items in the other categories. If the chosen category is also classified into 10 categories, the next choice eliminates another 90,000 items. With two choices we eliminated 990,000 items!</div>
				
				<p>For example, consider the National Public Radio Web site, <code>www.npr.org</code>, shown in Figure 5.3. We might visit this site to find audio information about current news. The site uses hierarchical organization in several ways.</p>
				
				<p>Studying the page, we first notice that the information is divided into two categories: <em>navigation</em> information at the top, and <em>content</em> information in the remainder of the page. More navigation links are scatterered throughout the content information, and at the bottom of the page. This navigation plus content structure is a standard format. The navigation links are provided for people checking the page for specific information, while the content information is for casual visitors who are browsing the latest stories NPR is covering. Notice this organization when visiting a new page.</p>
				
				<section class="subsection" data-number="6" data-name="Recognizing a Hierarchy">
					
					<h3>Recognizing a Hierarchy</h3>
					
					<p><span class="first-sentence">The navigation links define the hierarchy.</span> The six dark topic buttons across the top of the page are the <em>top level</em> of the NPR site's hierarchy. Clicking on</p>

						<figcaption><span class="figureId">Figure 5.3</span> The National Public Radio (NPR) homepage <code>http://www.npr.org</code>.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<p>any of these displays the links of the second level of the hierarchy below that top-level topic. For example, clicking on the News button displays a menu of nine second-level classifications:</p>
					
					<p><em>US, World, Opinion, Politics, Business, Technology, Science, Health</em> and <em>Sports</em></p>
					
					<p>Clicking on the <em>Programs</em> button, as shown in Figure 5.4(a) displays the four
					second-level classifications:</p>
					
					<p><em>News/Talk, Entertainment, Music</em> and <em>Special Series</em></p>
					
					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">132</div>

					</figure>
					
					<p>and under each of these, third level classifications. Below each of these will be more links, specialized to the kinds of information in that part of the collection.</p>
					
					<p>At the bottom of the page under "NPR Always On" is a slightly different hierarchical organization of this same information (see Figure 5.4(b)). Its structure is a large table with the top level going across and the second level going down. The difference is that the buttons at the top are designed for coverage, that is, to provide a path to all information, while the table is designed to give fast access to the most popular portions of the site.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="7" data-name="More Structural Information">
					
					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">133</div>
					
					<h3>More Structural Information</h3>
					
					<p><span class="first-sentence">In Figure 5.3 notice that the content of the page is organized into three columns.</span> The three columns can be filled separately. This allows the site designers to cluster related stories flexibly. For example, in the upper left corner are the breaking news stories. Halfway down the page the columns stop at the same point, a break signaling the end of the "top of the page."</p>
					
					<p>At this point (shown at the bottom of Figure 5.3) the three columns resume with headings <em>news, arts d7 life</em>, and <em>music</em>. We recognize these as the three main top-level headings listed in the dark topic buttons across the top of the page. Under each of these headings are second-level headings for that topic. So, for example, the news column has content information for each of the second-level classifications, <em>US, world</em>, and so forth. Thus, the hierarchical structure of NPR's site is presented again within the content information. Such consistency not only produces an easy-to-understand site for the casual visitor, it allows the frequent visitor to become familiar with the site's structure, probably simplifying navigation.</p>
				
				</section> <!-- Section 7 -->
				
				<section class="subsection" data-number="8" data-name="Design of Hierarchies">
					
					<h3>Design of Hierarchies</h3>
					
					<p><span class="first-sentence">Figure 5.5 shows the top two levels of the NPR site hierarchy drawn as a <strong>tree</strong>.</span> At the root is the Home page, and the leaves (not shown) are either content pages or further levels of classification.</p>
					
					<p>The tree is drawn on its side with the <em>root (Home)</em> to the left and the <em>leaves</em> (content pages, or lower hierarchical classifications) to the right (not shown). Hierarchy trees often are drawn sideways because it's more convenient to write (English) text that way. It is also common to draw trees upside down, with the root at the top. Either way, the important point is not the orientation, but the branching metaphor.</p>
					
					<p>Hierarchies us a general set of rules for their design and terminology:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Because hierarchy trees often are drawn with the root at the top, we say, "going up in the hierarchy" and "going down in the hierarchy." (Similar language&mdash;higher and deeper&mdash;was used with directory hierarchies in Chapter 3.) The terms are relative to the root being drawn at the top. So "going up" means the classifications become more inclusive; they are closer to the root. "Going down" means the classifications become more specific; they are farther from the root.</li>
						<li>The greater-than symbol (>) is a common way to show going down in a hierarchy through levels of classification:<br/><em>Home</em> > <em>Music</em> > <em>Browse Artists A-Z</em> > <em>C</em> > <em>The Cave Singers</em></li>
					</ul>
					
					<p><span class="paragraph-header">A two-level hierarchy.</span> The hierarchy shown in Figure 5.5 is a <em>two-level hierarchy</em> because there are two levels of "branching." Counting levels of a hierarchy can sometimes be a little confusing because of all the connecting lines, but it's</p>
					
					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">134</div>
					
					<figure>
						<img src="/contents/fluency/images/figure5.5.png">
						<figcaption><span class="figureId">Figure 5.5</span> The top two levels of the NPR hierarchy tree; the root (Home) is shown at left, and the leaves (not shown) would be listed on the right under each topic.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<p>easy if we keep two points in mind. First, the tree always has a root&mdash;the collection's name; in this case, that's Home. Second, all trees have leaves&mdash;the items themselves; in this case, the third-level pages, not shown. Because they exist without any hierarchy, the root and leaves do not count as levels of the hierarchy. When we ignore the root and leaves in Figure 5.5, we see two levels of classification.</p>
					
					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">135</div>
					
					<p><span class="paragraph-header">Overlapping and partitioning of levels.</span> There is not one best way to classify information; stories can be listed as a leaf more than once. For example, the story about books for fashion conscious people on a budget can be reached several ways:</p>
					
					<p><em>Home > Arts & Life > Books > Three Books for Frugal Fashionistas <br/>Home > Listen > Latest Program > Three Books for Frugal Fashionistas</em></p>
					
					<p>When every leaf appears only once in the hierarchy, the groupings are called <strong>partitionings</strong>. The tree of life is a partitioning because every species is listed once. When groupings "overlap," meaning that an item is listed in more than one category, the leaves are repeated. Classifications that are convenient for the searcher often overlap, making such hierarchies easy to use.</p>
					
					<p><span class="paragraph-header">Number of levels may differ.</span> The number of classifications in a hierarchy does not need to be the same for all items. That is, the number of levels between a leaf and the root does not need to be the same for every leaf. Some groupings might require more levels of classification to reduce the group to a manageable size. For example, the <em>Browse Artists A&ndash;Z</em> under <em>music</em> asks first for the first letter of the artist's name; this makes the path at least one level longer than, say, news on the music page.</p>

				<h2>Searching the Web for Information</h2>
				
				<p><span class="first-sentence">A <strong>search engine</strong> is a collection of computer programs that helps us find information on the Web.</span> Though programs for text searching existed long before the Web, the explosion of Web&ndash;based digital information and its distribution across the planet made the invention of search engines necessary. No one organizes the information posted on the Web, so these programs look around to find out what's out there and organize what they find. It's a big task. How do search engines do it?</p>
				
				<section class="subsection" data-number="10" data-name="How a Search Engine Works">
					
					<h3>How a Search Engine Works</h3>
					
					<p><span class="first-sentence">The first step, called <em>crawling</em>, looks at every page in the collection of pages to be searched.</span> As the <strong>crawler</strong>&mdash;the software that does the crawling&mdash;looks through the pages, it builds an index. The index is a list of tokens (such as words) that are associated with the pages. For each token, the crawler creates a list of the URLs of pages found to be associated with that token. So, for example, we imagine that the indexed search for the word "cat" might look something like the list shown in Figure 5.6.</p>
					
					<p>The second step in an indexed search is called <em>query processing</em>. The user presents tokens to the <strong>query processor</strong>&mdash;the software that processes the queries&mdash;that it looks up in the index. So, if you type c&ndash;a&ndash;t into your favorite search engine, it looks up the word in the index and returns to you the list of the pages associated with "cat" in the index.</p>
					
					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">136</div>
					
					<figure>
						<img src="/contents/fluency/images/figure5.6.png">
						<figcaption><span class="figureId">Figure 5.6</span> Sample results of searches near the entry "cat" in an index produced by a Web crawler. Some of the lists are very long&mdash;there are over 800,000,000 URLs following <em>cat</em>.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<p>By creating the index ahead of time, search engines are able to answer user queries very quickly, even if the original crawling takes a long time.</p>
					
					<div class="fluency-bit"><strong class="fluency-bit-title">Three Little Words.</strong> The crawler considers almost anything followed by a space or punctuation symbol a token, except short words like <em>a, an,</em> and <em>the</em>. But even these words can become tokens by being part of important phrases, like <em>The New York Times</em>.</div>
			
				</section> <!-- Section 10 -->
				
				<section class="subsection" data-number="11" data-name="Multiword Indexed Searches">
					
					<h3>Multiword Indexed Searches</h3>
					
					<p><span class="first-sentence">Generally, when we make a multiple&ndash;word query, we want the pages returned by the query processor to be appropriate for all of the words.</span> That is, when we type</p>
					
					<p><code>red fish blue guppy</code></p>
					
					<p>we mean that each page returned should be associated with <em>all</em> of these words. (This is called an AND&ndash;query because it instructs the query processor to find pages relevant to the words <code>red</code> and <code>fish</code> and <code>blue</code> and <code>guppy</code>. We learn more about AND&ndash;queries and other forms of queries momentarily.)</p>
					
					<p>The problem for the query processor is that there is no index entry corresponding to a <em>set</em> of tokens, just the lists for the individual words. There is no time to crawl the Web to build an index for that set of words. What is a query processor to do?</p>
			
					<p><span class="paragraph-header">Intersecting Queries </span>To locate pages containing these words, the query processor simply fetches the lists and <strong>intersects</strong> them, meaning the query processor finds which URLs are on all of the lists. To make the task of inter-</p>
					
					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">137</div>
					
					<p>secting multiple lists a little easier, the URL lists might be alphabetized. This speeds up the processing because it is possible to notice easily when the same URL is on multiple lists. So, for example, for the index lists of the three tokens</p>
					
					<table class="example aligned">
						<tr>
							<th><code>token1</code></th>
							<th><code>token2</code></th>
							<th><code>token3</code></th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><code>www.ab.com</code></td>
							<td><code>www.aa.com</code></td>
							<td class="highlighted"><code>www.rs.org</code></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="highlighted"><code>www.rs.org</code></td>
							<td><code>www.ab.com</code></td>
							<td><code>www.zz.edu</code></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><code>www.ru.com</code></td>
							<td><code>www.m.edu</code></td>
							<td></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td>
							<td class="highlighted"><code>www.rs.org</code></td>
							<td></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					
					<p>the result of the intersection is <code>www.rs.org</code>, because that URL is associated with each of the three tokens as requested.</p>
					
					<p><span class="paragraph-header">Rules for intersecting alphabetized lists.</span> To intersect several alphabetized lists, the computer follows these simple rules:</p>
					
					<ol>
						<li>Put a marker such as an arrow at the start of each list.</li>
						<li>If all markers point to the same URL, save it, because all tokens are associated with the page.</li>
						<li>Advance the marker(s) one position for whichever URL is earliest in the alphabet.</li>
						<li>Repeat rules 2-3 until some marker reaches the end of the list.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p>The result is a list of the URLs saved in Step 2. Figure 5.7 illustrates this process.</p>

					<p>In summary, indexed search is very powerful because the computer takes the time to crawl the data (Web pages) and build an index first. Then all it needs to do is find the index entries for each word and intersect the lists to find the information we want. This is how a search engine like Google can look at billions of Web pages and give our answer back in one quarter of a second.</p>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">With the index telling the query processor all of the pages containing each word, it makes sense to try to get the most out of the "crawl-then-query" idea.</span> For this reason, query processors usually give us the option for an Advanced Search. Figure 5.8 shows the GUI for Google's <em>Advanced Search</em>, but others are similar.</p>
					
					<p><span class="paragraph-header">Logical operators.</span> Basic queries, including the "red fish blue guppy" query previously, are AND&ndash;queries: They require that all words given must be associated with the page for it to be a hit. A good way to think about AND&ndash;queries is that the page is a hit if</p>
					
					<p><code>red AND fish AND blue AND guppy</code></p>
					
					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">139</div>

						<figcaption><span class="figureId">Figure 5.8</span> Google Advanced Search GUI: The highlighted field is for AND words, the next is for phrases, the third is for OR words, and the fourth is for NOT words.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<p>are all associated with the page. When we write the query this way, we are using the word AND as a <strong>logical operator</strong>. A logical operator specifies a logical relationship between the words it connects. So, <code>red AND fish</code> says that the two logical tests for "Is <em>red</em> associated with the page?" AND "Is <em>fish</em> associated with the page?" must both be true. AND&ndash;queries are specified using the highlighted line of the Advanced Search GUI in Figure 5.8.</p>
					
					<p>Another logical operator is OR. An <strong>OR</strong>&ndash;query such as</p>
					
					<p><code>marshmallow OR strawberry OR chocolate</code></p>
					
					<p>hits on pages that are associated with one (at least, but possibly more) of the words. Using the Advanced Search GUI in Figure 5.8, OR&ndash;queries are given on the third line. The logical operator in <code>marshmallow OR strawberry</code> says that one or the other (or both) of the logical tests&mdash;"Is <em>marshmallow</em> associated with the page?" OR "Is <em>strawberry</em> associated with the page?"&mdash;is true.</p>
					
					<div class="try-it">
						<p><strong>5.2 Once Is Enough.</strong>To answer OR&ndash;queries like lisa OR bart OR homer, the query processor simply combines the index list for each word. One problem is that a page associated with <code>bart</code> may also be associated with <code>homer</code>, so that page will be listed for both words. Removing such duplicates is very similar to intersecting alphabetized lists. Revise the four rules for Intersect Alphabetized Lists to create new rules that will remove duplicates.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">140</div>
					
					<p>The fourth line of the Advanced Search window is for specifying words that are not to be associated with the page. In advanced searches that do <em>not</em> use the handy GUI shown in Figure 5.8, we use the logical operator NOT to specify such words; the construction is a NOT&ndash;query. So, for example, we write</p>
					
					<p><code>tigers AND NOT baseball</code></p>
					
					<p>to find pages about the striped animal rather than Detroit's major league baseball team. Notice that the AND is included because we want both requirements to be true: "Is <em>tigers</em> associated with the page?" AND NOT "Is <em>baseball</em> associated with the page?"</p>
					
					<p>In addition to the logical operators, the second line of the Advanced Query GUI allows phrases to be specified. But the easiest way to do this is simply to put the phrase in quotes.</p>
					
					<p><span class="paragraph-header">Combining logical operators.</span> Sometimes the queries we are interested in need AND, OR, <em>and</em> NOT operators. Because the logical operators work like arithmetic, we can combine them and group them using parentheses. So, we can write</p>
					
					<p><code>(marshmallow OR strawberry OR chocolate) AND sundae</code></p>
					
					<p>to require that one (or more) of the flavors and the word <em>sundae</em> be associated with the page. Write the OR portion of the query in parentheses so that it is clear that the flavors go together.</p>
					
					<p>If the OR&ndash;terms did not use the parentheses, as in</p>
					
					<p><code>marshmallow OR strawberry OR chocolate AND sundae</code></p>
					
					<p>the query would be ambiguous. <em>Ambiguous</em> means that it has two or more meanings. One possible meaning is the one given above with parentheses. Another possible meaning would be parenthesized as</p>
					
					<p><code>marshmallow OR strawberry OR (chocolate AND sundae)</code></p>
					
					<p>which allows hits on pages associated with only the word <em>marshmallow</em> or only the word <em>strawberry</em>, because <em>sundae</em> is required only for <em>chocolate</em>.</p>
					
					<p>It is usually acceptable to write queries in the form shown here using capital letters for the logical operators and parentheses to make the associations clear. In Google, it is also acceptable to use the following form in the basic search:</p>
					
					<img src="/contents/fluency/images/google7.png">
					
					<p>For Google, the AND is unnecessary because Google queries interpret a space to mean AND, making</p>
					
					<img src="/contents/fluency/images/google8.png">
					
					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">141</div>
					
					<p>an equivalent query. But not all Advanced Search software accepts blank, so it is wise to use the AND; it is rarely a mistake.</p>
					
					<div class="fluency-bit"><strong class="fluency-bit-title">Plus Numbers.</strong> Google ignores numbers on queries such as <code>rocky 3</code>. However, including a plus sign in front of the number tells Google not to ignore it and to use it as part of the query. Therefore, queries like <code>apollo +13</code> finds pages about that specific flight.</div>
					
					<p>Google has other nice features: Minus (&ndash;) as an abbreviation for NOT; it should be snuggled up right next to the associated word. Also, if the OR&ndash;words are all grouped together they don't need to be enclosed in parentheses, assuming that what you're looking for is one of the OR-choices together with whatever the remainder of the query specifies. So we can write</p>
					
					<p><code>simpson bart OR lisa OR maggie &ndash;homer &ndash;marge</code></p>
					
					<p>to get data on the Simpson children.</p>
					
					<div class="try-it">
						<p><strong>5.3 Sunny Day Driving.</strong> Write a query for Google's basic <em>I'm Feeling Lucky</em> search window to find pages about convertibles for any of these brands: Corvette, Mazda, and Porsche.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="fluency-bit"><strong class="fluency-bit-title">Shortsightedness.</strong> Search engines crawl only a fraction (substantially less than half) of the Web. Because it is growing so fast, there are always new pages to be visited. Librarians call the pages not crawled, the "Invisible Web." There are other reasons that crawlers miss pages:
						
						<ul>
							<li>No page points to it, so it never gets on the "to do" list</li>
							<li>The page is synthetic&mdash;that is, created on&ndash;the&ndash;fly by software for each user</li>
							<li>The encoding is a type the crawler does not recognize, that is, not HTML, PDF, etc.</li>

				<h2>Searching the World Wide Web</h2>
				
				<p><span class="first-sentence">Applying your general knowledge of searching and our preceding discussion of advanced search, we are now ready to learn how to make effective queries.</span> The two topics of importance in this section are:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>How do search engines decide whether a page is a hit?</li>
					<li>How do search engines decide what order to list the hits?</li>
				</ul>
				
				<section class="subsection" data-number="14" data-name="What Is a Hit?">
				
					<h3>What Is a Hit?</h3>
				
					<p><span class="first-sentence">It seems pretty obvious that a <strong>hit</strong> is a page that has (or doesn't have, if NOT is used) the words on it that the user gives in the query.</span> That's nearly right, but</p>
					
					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">142</div>
					
					<p>the exact details might surprise you. So, for example, suppose you are planning to write a report on the kind of star known as a red giant, and you type</p>
				
					<p><code>red giant</code></p>
				
					<p>into Google. You get back 4.9 million hits. In looking at the first five (see Figure 5.9), you can already see a problem. The first hit is for a software company, and the fifth hit is for a rock band. This is not surprising. Red Giant is a good name, so we expect to hit on pages about things named "red giant" that are not stars. But we don't want to go through all those pages, either.</p>

					<h3>Looking at the Search Results</h3>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">After adjusting the search to</span></p>

					<p><code>red giant &ndash;software &ndash;music</code></p>

					<p>the hits drop to 824,000, which is still ridiculously large. One thing that is interesting about the pages returned is that they all contain the words <em>red giant</em> in that order. But, an AND&ndash;query only requires that the two words appear <em>somewhere</em>; they do not have to be together, nor do they have to be in that order. Did we just get lucky? No, but we'll explain why we get all astronomy pages in a moment. Farther down in the list are pages about such things as <em>giant red</em> sculptures, squirrels, kangaroos, mustard plants, racehorses, and tropical fish. Also listed are pages in which the two words are used separately, without either modifying the other, as in a recipe for "<em>giant</em> beans baked with roasted <em>red</em> chili peppers."</p>

					<p>But curiously, there are pages in the list that contain one word, <em>red</em>, without containing the other, <em>giant</em>. For example, the page <code>redballproject.com/chicago/index.php</code> contains the word <em>red</em> but not <em>giant</em>. So, why is it a hit for</p>
					
					<figure>
						<img src="/contents/fluency/images/figure5.9.png">
						<figcaption><span class="figureId">Figure 5.9</span> The first five hits for the query <em>red giant</em> using Google.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">143</div>
					
					<p>the search <code>red giant</code>? The answer is that for a word to describe a page, the word doesn't actually have to be <em>on</em> the page. Specifically, the index for a word, say <em>red</em>, is not limited to pages <em>containing</em> the word. It also includes pages in which the word is used in the URL, as in <code>www.nusantara.com/2005/ 08/red-ball-project-by-kurt-perschke.html</code> (see Figure 5.10). And, most importantly, the index for a word includes pages in which the word is used in the <em>anchor text</em> of another page.</p>

				</section> <!-- Section 15 -->
				
				<section class="subsection" data-number="16" data-name="Anchor Text">

					<h3>Anchor Text</h3>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Recall that when a link is used in a Web page, it has two parts: the URL and the anchor.</span> So, if a Web page contains the following</p>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&hellip; Today, in Chicago a giant red ball was sighted on Jaume Street&hellip;</p>

					<p>and the <em>giant red ball</em> anchor has the URL <code>redballproject.com/chicago/index.php</code>, then the Google crawler finds</p>

					<p><code>&hellip;Chicago a &gt;a href="http://redballproject.com/chicago/index.php"&lt;giant red ball&gt;/a&lt;</code></p>

					<p>and assumes that the words <em>giant, red</em>, and <em>ball</em> all describe the page, so it adds the URL to the indexes of those three words. Although the page doesn't contain the word <em>giant</em>, the word was used in anchor text from some other page. That got the page into the index for <em>giant</em> and made it a hit for the query <em>red giant</em>.</p>

					<p>The idea behind including a page in the indexes of any words used in anchor text is that they may be a better description for the page than the page's actual content. Imagine a page about Sarah Silverman. It might always refer to her</p>
					
					<figure>
						<img src="/contents/fluency/images/figure5.10.png">
						<figcaption><span class="figureId">Figure 5.10</span> Photo from a page related to an art installation by Kurt Perschke in Chicago called the Red Ball Project, The pages are listed in a <code>red giant</code> search, but do not contain the word <em>giant</em>; it hits because <em>giant </em>was used in the anchor text.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">144</div>
					
					<p>as "Sarah" or use some other description for her like "the comedienne"; it may never use her whole name. But if your home page links to that page with the text</p>
					
					<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&hellip;this is the best page about Sarah Silverman that I know&hellip;</code></p>
					
					<p>then your link gives better information&mdash;her last name&mdash;than does the page itself. Use of the anchor text makes the crawl&ndash;then&ndash;query approach much more effective than it would be if it used just the content of the page.</p>
				
				</section> <!-- Section 16 -->
				
				<section class="subsection" data-number="17" data-name="Page Rank">
					
					<h3>Page Rank</h3>
					
					<p><span class="first-sentence">In the 824,000 hits for the <em>red giant</em> query, the pages listed at the start are all important and relevant.</span> How does the query processor know to list those pages first, ahead of pages about giant red squirrels, for example?</p>
					
					<p>The order in which hits are returned to a query is determined by a number Google calls the <strong>PageRank</strong>. The higher the PageRank, the closer to the top of the list a page will be. Google pioneered the page ranking idea as a way to determine which pages are likely to be most important to you. Of course, the computer has no way of actually knowing what is important to you, but page ranking works pretty well.</p>
					
					<p><span class="paragraph-header">Links to other pages.</span> Although Google has not revealed the complete information about how PageRank weights sites, we do know that it works like a voting system. If page A, <code>www.shoutOut.net/A.html</code>, links to page B, <code>www.celeb.com/B.html</code>, then in the Google page ranking system, A's link adds to B's importance.</p>
				
					<img src="/contents/fluency/images/extra5.1.png">
					
					<p>It is as if <code>shoutOut</code>'s link is a vote for the <code>celeb</code> page. Pages that are linked to a lot have a higher page ranking and, therefore, are assumed to be more important. This seems to make sense.</p>
					
					<p>A second important property of Google's page ranking system is that links from pages with a high page ranking are viewed as more important than links from pages with a low page ranking. So, if <code>shoutOut</code> has a high page ranking, its link will contribute more to <code>celeb</code>'s rank than, say, a link from <code>celeb.fanClub.org/myPatheticPage.html</code> that has a low page ranking.</p>
					
					<p>The PageRank is computed by the crawler, because as it looks at page A, it can notice the links to another page B and score one for B. Counting the number of links to a page is not sufficient, however, because it doesn't take into consideration that some links are more important than others. So, after the crawling is completed, the PageRank is computed and stored with each</p>
					
					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">145</div>
					
					<p>page. Then, as the query is being processed, the URLs that are found by the intersecting process can be sorted by their page ranking, highest to lowest, and returned to the user in that order.</p>
					
					<p>Red giant hits. So, now we know how the order of the hits was determined. It is not surprising, therefore, that among our first half dozen hits for <code>red giant &ndash;software &ndash;music</code></p>
					
					<p><code>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant<br/>www.historyoftheuniverse.com/starold.html<br/>imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/971016.html<br/>hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/astro/redgia.html<br/>www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/R/redgiant.html<br/>nrumiano.free.fr/Estars/fading.html</code></p>
					
					<p>there is a hit on Wikipedia. It is often listed in the first few items of a Web search, because Wikipedia must be linked to a lot, giving it a high page ranking. It also explains why a NASA site is among our top hits, and why another hit is Georgia State University. These are likely to be authoritative sites and so should have high page ranking because of many references. The <code>historyoftheuniverse</code> site is a page for a book, and publishers are frequently linked, raising its page ranking. Finally, the fifth and sixth hits are free online encyclopedias of science, which are probably also very popular.</p>
					
					<p>But why are these (and the next several hundred that follow) all devoted to stars rather than, say, giant red squirrels or other pages that match <em>red</em> and <em>giant</em>? The answer again lies in the anchor text. As we learned earlier, the text used on one Web page to describe another is often the best descriptor of the page. So, in computing page ranking, Google gives additional PageRank importance to pages for those words used in the anchor text. This makes sense: If many people use the words <em>red giant</em> in anchor text pointing at, say, a NASA page, then it is a page that is likely to be of interest to someone making a query <em>red giant</em>, and it should appear at the top of the list for that query. It is this property that explains why pages about stars come to the top of our <em>red giant</em> list, and not pages about squirrels.</p>

					<h3>Restricting Global Search</h3>
					
					<p><span class="first-sentence">Many sites offer the opportunity to perform a <strong>site search</strong>, which means looking only on their site.</span> The site search is usually offered on the home page with a search window and a <strong>Go</strong> button. If you know the site has the information you want, it is advisable to go there and perform a site search. This is usually the fastest way to find the right page. Notice that for many, many sites, it is possible to guess the right URL: <code>www.irs.gov</code> for tax information, or <code>www.princeton.edu</code> for information on Princeton University, or <code>nytimes.com</code> for information from <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>
			
				</section> <!-- Section 18 -->
				
				<section class="subsection" data-number="19" data-name="Focused Searches">
					
					<h3>Focused Searches</h3>
					
					<p><span class="first-sentence">Often when we need information we don't care where it's found, and we ask a search engine to check the whole WWW.</span> The result is frequently many,</p>
					
					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">146</div>
					
					<p>many hits that take time to look through. So, when we know more about the topic we're searching for, we can direct the search by adding additional constraints; see the bottom of Google's Advanced Search page in Figure 5.8.</p>
				
					<p><span class="paragraph-header">Constrained searches.</span> The constraints help us pinpoint the pages we want. For example, suppose we remember seeing a video of an art school's arts festival called Manifest. It was a slick name and a great video, but you don't remember much else about it. There must be a Web site for it&mdash;can we find it?</p>
					
					<p>Starting out, we search <code>art manifest</code> and get</p>
					
					<img src="/contents/fluency/images/google1.png">
					
					<p>which is kind of humorous&mdash;"Painters of the world, unite!"&mdash;but the page we are trying to find isn't in the top ten. Thinking that it's an art school, we try searching on <code>art school manifest</code> and get</p>
					
					<img src="/contents/fluency/images/google2.png">
					
					<p>which is better, but again the page we want isn't in the top ten list.</p>
					
					<p>Although that exhausts what we remember about the festival, it isn't the end of our search.</p>
					
					<p>At the bottom of the Google Advanced Search GUI, we are offered the filtering options (note others under the plus sign).</p>
					
					<img src="/contents/fluency/images/google3.png">
					
					<p>Guessing that the school will be in the <code>.edu</code> domain, we limit the search to that. Now, searching only <code>manifest</code> with that limitation delivers the page we're looking for at the top of the top ten list.</p>
					
					<img src="/contents/fluency/images/google4.png">
					
					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">147</div>
					
					<p>That's impressive, considering the hefty list of hits for <code>manifest</code>. We decide to make greater use of such tools in the future, and settle back to watch the video again.</p>
					
					<img src="/contents/fluency/images/google5.png">
					
					<p><span class="paragraph-header">Page ranking local searches.</span> There is one more way that these filtering tools can help. Many large sites like National Public Radio, the Internal Revenue Service, YouTube, and so forth provide a local search through their own documents. Often these searches work well, especially if the search term you're looking for is reasonably rare, and so the number of hits is small. But when it's not, and the hit list is large, the local search is often either unordered&mdash;presented in the sequence that the search engine found them&mdash;or else in some order that doesn't help you, say chronological.</p>
					
					<p>In such cases, making the same search but restricting it to a specific domain&mdash;for example, <code>www.youtube.com</code>&mdash;works because the page ranking information orders the hits. The local search doesn't know the page ranking information and so cannot give you the advantages of that ordering. Such searches are usually very, very effective.</p>
					<div class="fluency-tip"><strong class="fluency-tip-title">Finding the Needle.</strong> Narrowing the search to the right page is the first task, but finding the information can mean more searching on the page itself. Remember that browsers have a word&ndash;search facility, <em>Find</em>, under the <em>Edit</em> menu. To search on a page, use <em>Find</em>.

				<h2>Web Information: Truth or Fiction?</h2>
				
				<p><span class="first-sentence">One of the great benefits of the World Wide Web is how much it has expanded people's freedom of expression.</span> It is possible in many countries of the world to publish anything on the Web, uncensored by companies or govern&ndash;</p>
				
				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">148</div>
				
				<p>ments. This is a benefit, but, like all freedoms, this one carries with it some important responsibilities&mdash;not so much for the speaker, but for the reader or listener. Because anyone can publish anything on the Web, some of what gets published is false, misleading, deceptive, self&ndash;serving, slanderous, or simply disgusting. We have to be alert for this and always ask, <em>"Is this page legitimate, true, and correct?"</em> In this section we consider whether the pages we've found in our search provide reliable information.</p>
				
				<section class="subsection" data-number="21" data-name="Do Not Assume Too Much">
					
					<h3>Do Not Assume Too Much</h3>
					
					<p><span class="first-sentence">The first thing to look for is who or what organization publishes the Web page.</span> For example, health information from the Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization, or the American Medical Association is about the best you can access. These respected organizations try to publish current and correct information, so we can trust their Web pages. The published information is based on science; therefore, new discoveries might occasionally invalidate something. But we're not discussing the philosophical aspects of the <em>nature of truth</em> here. We can assume that respected organizations publish the best information available at the time, and we're unlikely to find better.</p>
					
					<p>Checking the organization that publishes the information seems like overkill. After all, if the Web site's domain name is <code>ama&ndash;assn.org</code>, it claims to be the AMA page, and it's giving out medical information, it must be the American Medical Association, right? In fact, it is. But just because a page seems to be from a certain organization and the domain name <em>seems</em> plausible, it isn't necessarily true. Domain names are not checked. Anyone could have reserved the domain name <code>ama-assn.org</code> and published bogus health information. You must be wary.</p>
					
					<p>To illustrate that sites are not always what they appear to be, consider the hoax perpetrated by the site <code>www.gatt.org</code>. The domain name looks like it is related to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the free&ndash;trade agreement of the 1990s. The site looks like the official publication of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the free&ndash;trade group that followed on from the GATT treaty. The page shows the WTO logo, gives the actual WTO address, and posts WTO&ndash;related free&ndash;trade news. However, the site is actually run by an <em>anti</em>&ndash;free&ndash;trade organization known as the Yes Men.</p>
					
					<p>According to the January 7, 2001, <em>New York Times</em>, organizers of a meeting of international trade lawyers in Salzburg, Austria, sent mail to <code>www.gatt.org</code> inviting WTO President Moore to speak at their meeting. From <code>www.gatt.org</code> came an email reply declining on behalf of Mr. Moore, but offering (a fictitious) speaker, Dr. Andreas Bichlbauer, as a substitute. The meeting organizers accepted Dr. Bichlbauer who came to their October 2000 meeting and gave a very offensive speech critical of Italians and Americans. The perpetrators of the hoax even claimed that a WTO protestor threw a cream pie at Dr. Bichlbauer. They claimed that the pie contained a <em>bacillus</em>, that Bichlbauer had taken ill and was hospitalized, and that he had died. The whole hoax, which</p>	
					
					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">149</div>
					
					<p>caused much embarrassment, began when someone assumed that <code>www.gatt.org</code> was a legitimate WTO site.</p>

					<h3>A Two-Step Check for the Site's Publisher</h3>
					
					<p><span class="first-sentence">How can you find out if a site is legitimate? A two-step process can help.</span></p>
					
					<ol>
						<li>The InterNIC site <code>www.internic.net/whois.html</code> lists the company that assigned the site's IP address (i.e., domain). Type in the domain name, such as <code>company.com</code>. In some instances you will receive the registration information for the domain directly. In most cases, how- ever, the InterNIC information about the domain includes a site called a <code>WhoIs Server</code> maintained by the company that assigned the address. That site will tell you who owns the domain.</li>
						<li>Go to the <code>WhoIs Server</code> site and type in the domain name or IP address again. The information returned is the owner's name and physical address.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p>When checking a Web site, remember to pull out the domain name from the URL.</p>
					
					<p>Elaborate hoaxes like <code>gatt.org</code> are rare, although there have been others. A more likely situation is that information is unintentionally wrong or simply fictional. "Urban legends"&mdash;stories like alligators living in the New York City sewer system&mdash;fall into the first category. People pass along the information as true, although they don't have primary evidence or an authoritative basis for believing it. Urban myths are usually harmless, but not always. Stories in the second category, fictional and humorous, are meant to entertain us. April Fools' pages, alien spaceships visiting Seattle's Space Needle, and reports of one&ndash;ton squirrels are common and fun. Still, it's best to approach Web pages with some skepticism.</p>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Finally, if the information is important to you, check more than one source.</span> After all, it is very easy to use the Internet to find information, and it's equally easy to use it to cross&ndash;check information. Ask yourself, "If this information were true, what other source could directly or indirectly confirm it?" Of course, we must be equally skeptical about the supporting information. For example, we cannot count the number of sites referencing information as proof that it's true, because by that reasoning the alligators&ndash;in&ndash;the&ndash;sewer urban legend would seem to be supported by the 105,000 hits on <code>alligator AND sewer</code>. A better approach is to find sites that speak directly to the urban legend topic, such as <code>www.snopes.com</code>.</p>

				<h2>The Burmese Mountain Dog Page</h2>
				
				<p><span class="first-sentence">To test our ability to assess a site, suppose we have found <code>burmesemountaindog.info</code>, a site describing the Burmese Mountain Dog (see Figure 5.11).</span> The page looks authoritative, describing itself as the official site of the Burmese Mountain Dog Club of America. It has been posted by someone claiming DVM credentials, probably meaning doctor of veterinary medicine. There are photographs, links to the American Kennel Club, and so on.
				The page seems completely legitimate and meets most of the criteria that Internet users have listed as indicating authenticity. If we ask Google to find</p>

					<figcaption><span class="figureId">Figure 5.11</span> The Burmese Mountain Dog page.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				
				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">151</div>
				
				<p><code>burmese mountain dog</code>, we get 604,000 hits. Many people would probably accept the page as truthful.</p>
				
				<p>Because the page has a link to the American Kennel Club, <code>akc.org</code>, which lists all breeds the club recognizes, its possible to check out the Burmese Mountain Dog. In the AKC's list of breeds, we find that there is no Burmese Mountain Dog, but there is a Bernese Mountain Dog, named for Berne, Switzerland. What gives? First, we ask if <code>akc.org</code> is legitimate by using the <code>InterNIC WhoIs</code> service, and we find that it is. Next, we check <code>50megs.com</code> and find it is a free Web hosting site. This seems reasonable because if the Burmese Mountain Dog is not yet recognized by the AKC, perhaps an independent group of enthusiasts is behind the site. Accepting that the AKC is giving correct information about the Bernese Mountain Dog, we conclude that either the Burmese page is a fake or the Burmese Mountain Dog is not yet a recognized breed.</p>
			
				<p>It is interesting that there are so many hits on Burmese Mountain Dog, but when we ask Google to look up <code>bernese mountain dog</code> we get 754,000 hits, so the Bernese seems to be even more popular. The similarity of names suggests that someone has made a comparison, so we check for pages citing both breeds. Searching <code>bernese burmese mountain dog</code> yields 26,500 hits.</p>
				
				<p>The first hit is to the <code>museumofhoaxes.com</code>, and the next hit says, "There is no such thing as a <strong>Burmese</strong> mountain dog breed."</p>
				
				<p>We check the site and find that that author claims Burmese Mountain Dogs are a hoax. But a few sites later in the hit list is a site with pages and pages of photos of Burmese Mountain Dogs. Who's right? A quick look at several of the pages shows photos of what the AKC calls a Bernese Mountain Dog but the photographer calls a Burmese Mountain Dog. Obviously people are mispronouncing and misspelling the name, and the two are not separate breeds. So, we visit <code>www.burmesemountaindog.org</code> to see a different spoof, and finally return to the original page to admire how skillful a hoax it is.</p>

					<li>Libraries are excellent primary resource tools.</li>
					<li>Large public and university libraries have extensive online resources.</li>
					<li>Libraries not only provide information digitally, they also connect us with "pre-digital" archives&mdash;the millions of books, journals, and manuscripts that still exist only in paper form.</li>
					<li>We need software and our own intelligence to search the Internet effectively.</li>
