					<strong>We have </strong>seen the benefits of using spreadsheets to
					organize lists of information. By arranging similar information into columns and using a separate row for
					each new list item, we can easily sort data, use formulas to summarize and compute values, get help from
					the computer to set up series, and so forth. Spreadsheets are very powerful, but with databases it's
					possible to apply even greater degrees of organization and receive even more help from the computer.
				</p>
				<p>
					The key idea is to supply metadata describing the properties of the collected information. Recall that
					metadata is simply information describing (the properties of ) other information. We have seen the idea of
					specifying metadata in Chapter 8, when we saw tags - the metadata - describe the content of the <em>Oxford
					English Dictionary</em>, enabling the computer to help us search for words and definitions. Some databases
					use tags for metadata, others use different kinds of metadata, but the same principles apply: Knowing the
					structure and properties of the data, the computer can help us retrieve, organize, and manage it.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this chapter we distinguish between the everyday concept of a table and a relational database
					table. Next, we explain how to set up the metadata for collections of information to create a database.
					The principles are straightforward and intuitive. We will make the metadata tangible by using a notation
					called XML. After introducing basic table concepts, we present the five fundamental operations on tables
					and the Join operation. The concepts of physical database and logical database are connected by the
					concept of queries, and we illustrate how to build a user's logical view from physical tables. Finally,
					the convenience of Query By Example is illustrated using simple examples.

		<section class="section" data-number="1" data-name="Differences Between Tables and Databases">
			<h2>Differences Between Tables and Databases</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="first-sentence">When we think of databases, we often think of tables of information. For example, your iTunes or similar
				application records the title, artist, running time, and so on in addition to the actual MP3 data (the music).</span>
				Your favorite song is a row in that table. Another example is your state's database of automobile registrations
				recording the owner's name and address, the vehicle identification number (VIN), the license plate number, and
				such. Your car is a row in the registration database table. And as a last example, the U.S. Central Intelligence
				Agency (CIA) keeps an interesting database called the World Factbook; see
				https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html. They have a demographic table that records
				the country name, population, life expectancy, and so on. The U.S. is a row in the demography table.
			</p>
			
			<section class="subsection" data-number="2" data-name="Comparing Tables">
				<h3>Comparing Tables</h3>
				<p><span class="first-sentence">To see the difference between these database tables and other forms of tables, such as spreadsheets and
				HTML tables, consider the row for Canada in the CIA's demographic database.</span> This row is displayed as</p>
				<table class="one-row">
					<tr>
						<td><strong>Canada</strong></td>
						<td>32805041</td>
						<td>1.61</td>
						<td>5</td>
						<td>80.1</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
		
				<p>in a table with column headings such as Country, Population, and Birthrate. In the file it is represented as</p>
				
				<code>
					<pre>
&lt;demogData&gt;
	&lt;country&gt;Canada&lt;/country&gt;
	&lt;population&gt;32805041&lt;/population&gt;
	&lt;fertility&gt;1.61&lt;/fertility&gt;
	&lt;infant&gt;5&lt;/infant&gt;
	&lt;lifeExpct&gt;80.1&lt;/lifeExpct&gt;
&lt;/demogData&gt;
					</pre>
				</code>
				
				<p>
					where the tags identify the population, fertility or birthrate, infant mortality (per 1,000 live births),
					and life expectancy. That is, we are shown a row of data as it appears in any other table, but inside the
					computer it has a tag identifying each of the data fields.
				</p>
				<p>How does this data appear in other table forms? In a spreadsheet, the following is the row for Canada. </p>
				
				<img src="/contents/fluency/images/spreadsheet01.png" />
				
				<p>
					The entries for Canada are the same, but the software knows the values only by position, not by their
					meaning. So, if a cell is inserted at the beginning, causing all of the data to shift right one position,
				</p>
		
				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">473</div>
		
				<img src="/contents/fluency/images/spreadsheet02.png"/>
				
				<p>
					the identity of the information is lost. Spreadsheets rely on position to keep the integrity of their data;
					the information is not known by its <code>&lt;country&gt; </code>tag, but rather as A37.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					HTML tables are possibly even worse. The usual Web page presentation of the data for Canada is represented
					in HTML as
				</p>
				<code>
					<pre>
&lt;tr&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;Canada&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;32805041&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;1.61&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;80.1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
					</pre>
				</code>
				
				<p>
					where we recall that <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> is a table row tag and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> is a table data tag. These tags simply
					identify Canada's data as table entries with no unique identity at all; that is, the same kind of <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>
					tags surround all of the different forms of data. HTML is concerned only with how to display the data, not with
					its meaning.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="subsection" data-number="3" data-name="The Database's Advantage">
				<h3>The Database's Advantage</h3>
				
				<p>
					<span class="first-sentence">The metadata is the key advantage of databases over other approaches to recording data as tables.</span> Here's
					why. Suppose we want to know the life expectancy of Canadians. Database software can search for the
					<code> &lt;country&gt;</code> tag surrounding Canada. When it's found, the<code> &lt;country&gt;</code> tag will be one of several tags
					surrounded by <code>&lt;demogData&gt;</code> tags. These constitute the entry for Canada in the database. The software can
					then look for the <code>&lt;lifeExpct&gt; </code>tag among those tags and report the data that they surround as the data for
					Canada. The computer knew which data to return based on the availability of the metadata.
				</p>
				
				<p>The tags for the CIA database just discussed fulfill two of the most important roles in defining metadata.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Identify the type of data:</strong> Each different type of value is given a unique tag.</li>
					<li><strong>Define the affinity of the data:</strong> Tags enclose all data that is logically related.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					The <code>&lt;country&gt;</code>,<code> &lt;population&gt;</code>, and similar tags have the role of identification because they
					label the content. The <code>&lt;demogData&gt;</code> tag has the role of implementing affinity because it keeps an entry's
					data together. There are other properties of data that metadata must record, as you will see throughout this
					chapter, but these are perhaps the most fundamental.

		<section class="section" data-number="4" data-name="XML: A Language for Metadata Tags">
			<h2>XML: A Language for Metadata Tags</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="first-sentence">To emphasize the importance of metadata and to prepare for our own applications of database technology, let's take
				a moment to discuss the basics of <span class="keyword">XML</span>.</span> XML stands for the Extensible
				Markup Language, and like the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), it is basically a tagging scheme, making it
				rather intuitive. The tagging scheme used for the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> (OED) in Chapter 8 was a
				precursor to XML, and the demographic data of the last section was written in XML.
			</p>
			<p>
				What makes XML easy and intuitive is that there are no standard tags to learn. <em>We think up the tags we
				need!</em> Computer scientists call this a <em>self-describing language</em>, because whatever we create becomes the
				language (tags) to structure the data. There are a couple of rules - for example, always match tags - but
				basically anything goes. Perhaps XML is the world's easiest-to-learn "foreign" language.
			</p>
			<p>
				The same people who coordinate the Web - <span class="keyword">the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</span> - developed
				XML. As a result, it works very well with browsers and other Web-based applications. So, it comes as no surprise
				that just as XHTML must be written with a text editor rather than a word processoruse a fg to avoid
				unintentionally including the word processor's tags, we must also write XML in a simple text editor for the same
				reason. Use the same editor that you used in Chapter 4 to practice writing Web pages: TextWrangler for Mac users
				and Notepad++ for Windows users.
			</p>
			
			<div class="fluency-tip">
				<strong class="fluency-tip-title">Use a Text Editor for XML.</strong> Like XHTML, XML should be written using a text
				editor like Notepad++ or TextWrangler rather than a word processor like Word or Word Perfect. Text editors give
				you only the text you see, but word processors include their own tags and other information that could confuse
				XML.
			</div>
			<section class="subsection" data-number="5" data-name="An Example from Tahiti">
				<h3>An Example from Tahiti</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="first-sentence">Let's use XML to define tags to specify the metadata for a small data collection.</span> Given the following size
					data (area in km2) for Tahiti and its neighboring islands in the Windward Islands archipelago of the South
					Pacific,
				</p>
				<table class="data small">
					<tr>
						<td>Tahiti</td>
						<td>1048</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Moorea</td>
						<td>130</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Maiao</td>
						<td>9.5</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Mehetia</td>
						<td>2.3</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Tetiaroa</td>
						<td>12.8</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
						
				<p>
					we want to add the metadata, that is, identify which data is an island name and which is the area. As
					usual, the tag and its companion closing tag surround the data. We choose <code>&lt;iName&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;area&gt;</code> as the
					tags and write:
				</p>
				
				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">474</div>
				
				<code>
					<pre>
&lt;iName&gt;Tahiti&lt;/iName&gt; 		&lt;area&gt;1048&lt;/area&gt;
&lt;iName&gt;Moorea&lt;/iName&gt; 		&lt;area&gt;130&lt;/area&gt;
&lt;iName&gt;Maiao&lt;/iName&gt; 		&lt;area&gt;9.5&lt;/area&gt;
&lt;iName&gt;Mehetia&lt;/iName&gt; 		&lt;area&gt;2.3&lt;/area&gt;
&lt;iName&gt;Tetiaroa&lt;/iName&gt; 	&lt;area&gt;12.8&lt;/area&gt;
					</pre>
				</code>
				<p>
					These tags are used in the identification role. Notice that we chose <code>&lt;iName&gt;</code> rather than, say,
					<code>&lt;island name&gt;</code>. This is because XML tag names cannot contain spaces. But because both uppercase and
					lowercase are allowed - XML is case sensitive - we capitalize the "N" to make the tag more
					readable. All XML rules are shown later in this section in Table 16.1.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Though we have labeled each item with a tag describing what it is, we're not done describing the data. We
					need tags describing what sort of thing the name specifies and the area measures. That's an island, of course.
					So we enclose each entry with an <code>&lt;island&gt;</code> tag, as in
				</p>
				<code>
					<pre>
&lt;island&gt;&lt;iName&gt;Tahiti&lt;/iName&gt; 		&lt;area&gt;1048&lt;/area&gt;&lt;/island&gt;
&lt;island&gt;&lt;iName&gt;Moorea&lt;/iName&gt; 		&lt;area&gt;130&lt;/area&gt;&lt;/island&gt;
&lt;island&gt;&lt;iName&gt;Maiao&lt;/iName&gt; 		&lt;area&gt;9.5&lt;/area&gt;&lt;/island&gt;
&lt;island&gt;&lt;iName&gt;Mehetia&lt;/iName&gt; 		&lt;area&gt;2.3&lt;/area&gt;&lt;/island&gt;
&lt;island&gt;&lt;iName&gt;Tetiaroa&lt;/iName&gt; 	&lt;area&gt;12.8&lt;/area&gt;&lt;/island&gt;
					</pre>
				</code>
				
				<p>
					The <code>&lt;island&gt;</code> tag serves in the affinity role to keep the two facts together; that is, Tahiti is
					grouped with its area and it is separated from Moorea and its area.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					We're nearly done. The islands are not just randomly dispersed around the ocean. They are part of an
					archipelago, the proper name for a group of islands. So, we naturally invent one more tag, <code>&lt;archipelago&gt;</code>,
					and surround all of the islands with it. The result is shown in Figure 16.1.
				</p>

				<h3>Expanding the Use of XML</h3>
				<p><span class="first-sentence">Given the XML encoding of two archipelagos - the Windward Islands and the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands - it seems reasonable to combine the encodings.</span></p>
				<p>
					To create a database of the two archipelagos, we place them in a file, one after the other. This might seem
					odd because the Windward Islands have only two data values - name and area - while the Gal&aacute;pagos
					Islands have three - name, area, and elevation. But this is okay. Both archipelago encodings use the same
					tags for the common information, which is the key issue to consider when combining them. Extra data is allowed
					and, in fact, we might want to gather the elevation data for the Windward Islands.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the two archipelagos combined into one database, we want to include the name of each to tell them
					apart easily. Of course, this means adding another tag for the name. We could use <code>&lt;name&gt;</code>, which is
					different from the <code>&lt;iName&gt;</code> tag used before. But in the same way that we added &#8220;i&#8221; to remind
					ourselves that it is an island name, it is probably wise to use the same idea to create a more specific tag
					name. Let's adopt the tag <code>&lt;a_name&gt;</code>. Notice the use of underscore, which is an allowed punctuation symbol
					for XML. We will place the name inside the <code>&lt;archipelago&gt;</code> tag, since it is data about the archipelago.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, we have two archipelagos and we need to group them together by surrounding them with tags; these
					tags will serve as the root element of our
				</p>
					
				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">477</div>
				<p>
					XML database. A <span class="keyword">root element</span> is the tag that encloses all of the content of the XML
					file. In Figure 16.1 the <code>&lt;archipelago&gt;</code> tag was the root element, but now with two archipelagos in the
					file, we need a new tag to enclose them. They are both geographic features of our planet, so we will use<code>
					&lt;geo_feature&gt;</code> as the tag that surrounds both archipelagos. The final result of our revisions is shown in
					Figure 16.2.
				</p>
				<p>
					Notice that the text in the file has been indented to make it more readable. Like XHTML, XML doesn't care
					about white space - spaces, tabs, and new lines - when they are between tags. This allows us to format
					XML files to simplify working with them, but the indenting is only for our use.

					paired double quotes. If the content of the tag attribute requires quotes or an apostrophe (the single
						quote), then enclose the attribute value in the other form of quotes. So, we might have 
				</p>
				<code>&lt;entry warnIfNone="Ain't there!"&gt; The user entered this data. &lt;/entry&gt;</code>
				<p>for one instance, and</p>
				<code>&lt;entry warnIfNone='I say, "Please enter" '&gt; The data is from a user.&lt;/entry&gt;</code>

				<p>
					Understanding how to write tag attributes is easy enough. Even the rules for using quotes are
					straightforward. But, we want to use them wisely, which requires some thought.

					The best advice about attributes is to use them for additional metadata, not for actual content. So,

				<code>&lt;archipelago name="Galapagos"&gt;</code>
				<p>
					we chose not to because the name of an archipelago is content. A better use is to give an alternate form of

				<p>
					which records that the second "a" in Gal&aacute;pagos is accented. The name of the islands is still given
					using a normal tag, but specifying accent marks separately simplifies searching and display options.

				<h3>Effective Design with XML Tags</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="first-sentence">XML is a very flexible way to encode metadata.</span> As we have described the archipelagos, we have used a few
					basic guidelines to decide how to use the tags. To emphasize these rules, let's review our thinking in creating

				<div class="rule">

						<span class="ruleName">Identification Rule: Label Data with Tags Consistently.</span> You can choose whatever

					Notice that one of the advantages of enclosing data with tags is that it keeps the data together. For

					differently than the oneword island names since the tags keep the two words together.
				</p>
				<p>
					You may think that because we can choose our own tag names, it might be difficult to combine databases
					written by two different people - without planning ahead, they will probably choose different tags. Luckily,
					such differences are easily resolved: Because the tags are used consistently, it is possible to edit a file
					using Find/Replace to change the tag names. (There are other, more sophisticated ways to make them consistent,
					too.) For example, if your friend, who gathered the archipelago data for the Northern Hemisphere, used
					<code> &lt;Name&gt;</code> for the archipelago name rather than <code>&lt;a_name&gt;</code>, use Find to locate
				</p>
				
				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber"> 479 </div>
				
				<p>
					<code>&lt;Name&gt;</code> and Replace to substitute <code>&lt;a_name&gt;</code>. Of course, searching for Name alone and replacing it
					with a_name does not work since it would match and ruin the <code>&lt;iName&gt;</code> tags. (If such cases do get in the
					way, use the placeholder technique described in Chapter 2.)
				</p>
				<div class="rule">
					<p>
						<span class="ruleName">Affinity Rule: Group Related Data. </span>Enclose in a pair of tags all tagged data
						referring to the same entity. Grouping it keeps it all together, but the idea is much more fundamental:
						Grouping makes an association of the tagged data items as being related to each other, properties of the same
						thing.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					We applied this rule when we grouped the island name and area data inside <code>&lt;island&gt;</code> tags. We did this
					because both items referred to the same thing, the island. This is an important association, because the area
					data is not just area data about some random place on the earth; it is the area data for a specific place that
					is named Tahiti. This is an extremely important result from the simple act of enclosing data in tags.
				</p>
				<p>
					When we added elevation data as an additional feature of islands, we included it inside the <code>&lt;island&gt;</code>
					tags for the same reason. As the elevation data shows, it is not necessary for every instance of an object to
					have data for the same set of characteristics.
				</p>
		
				<div class="rule">
					<p>
						<span class="ruleName">Collection Rule: Group Related Instances. </span>When you have several instances of the
						same kind of data, enclose them in tags; again, it keeps them together and implies that they are related by
						being instances of the same type.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<p>
					When we had a group of five islands from the same area of the ocean, we grouped them inside an
					<code>&lt;archipelago&gt;</code> tag, and when we had a group of two archipelagos, we grouped them inside a
					<code>&lt;geo_feature&gt;</code> tag. We also added the names to the archipelagos using <code>&lt;a_name&gt;</code>, because as a
					collection they also have this additional property that we want to record.
				</p>
				<p>
					Notice that the Affinity Rule and Collection Rule are different. The Affinity Rule groups together the data
					for a single thing - an island. Typically, the tags of the data values will all be different reflecting the
					different properties of the thing. The Collection Rule groups together the data of several instances of the same
					thing. Typically, in this case the tags - in our case <code>&lt;islands&gt;</code> - will be the same. The first
					association is among properties of an object, the second is among the objects themselves, which we also call
					entities. Notice that being grouped by the Collection Rule doesn't preclude being an object; the islands grouped
					together form a larger object, the archipelago, and so it has properties, too, such as a name.

			<h2>Tables and Entities</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="first-sentence">You have seen how you can record metadata about a collection of data values using XML tags.</span> For the moment,
				let's set aside the topics of tagging and XML, and focus directly on table database systems generally. I want you
				to understand the concepts of database organization and the desirable properties embodied in the metadata, not
				simply the way to encode that structure with tags. We'll return to tagging later in the next chapter, but for now,
				think of tables pure and simple.
			</p>
			<p>
				The kind of database approach we will discuss is known as a relational database. <span >Relational
				databases</span> describe the relationships among the different kinds of data - the sort of ideas embodied in
				Affinity and Collection Rules -  allowing the software to answer queries about them. Although every relational
				database can be described by XML, it is not true that anything described by XML is a relational database. It may
				seem that relational databases are limited, but their power is enormous.
			</p>
			
			<div class="fluency-bit">
					<strong class="fluency-bit-title">A Bright Idea.</strong> Though many people contributed to the creation of relational
					databases, E. F. Codd of IBM is widely credited with the original concept. He received the Association of
					Computing Machinery's Turing Award, the field's Nobel Prize, for the idea.

				<h3>Entities</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="first-sentence">What <em>do</em> we want in database tables?</span> Entities. &#8220;Entity&#8221; is about as vague as &#8220;thing&#8221; and
					&#8220;stuff,&#8221; but the inventors of databases didn't want to limit the kinds of information that can be
					stored. An <span class="keyword">entity</span> is anything that can be identified by a fixed number of its
					characteristics, called <span class="keyword">attributes</span>; the attributes have names and values, and the
					values are the data that is stored in the table. (Unfortunately, <em>attributes</em> is an overused word in computing; in
					relational databases, think of an attribute as a &#8220;column of a table,&#8221; where the &#8220;attribute
					names&#8221; are the column headings and the &#8220;attribute values&#8221; are the entries. We use the term <em>tag
					attributes</em> when we mean the attributes of XML.)
				</p>
				<p>
					To relate entities and attributes to the metadata discussion earlier in this chapter, think of the
					attribute's name as the tag used in the Identity role, and the attribute values as the content enclosed in the
					tags. An entity is a group of attributes collected together by a tag used in the Affinity role. When describing
					affinity, we noted that the tagged data that we were grouping together all applied to one object, which was why it
					made sense to enclose it in tags. That object is the entity - the thing that the data applies to. Think of the
					tag used in affinity as the entity's name, and the tags that we allow within it as its attributes. So, an
					&#8220;island&#8221; is an entity, and its attributes include &#8220;name,&#8221; &#8220;area,&#8221; and
					&#8220;elevation&#8221;; see Figure 16.4. An &#8220;archipelago&#8221; is also an entity.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					So, an entity defines a table. The name of the entity is the name of the table, and each of its possible
					attributes is assigned a column with the column

					heading being the attribute name. The values in the columns are the attributes' values, and the rows are the
					entity instances. We say  <span class="keyword">entity instances</span> for a row because a specific set of values
					for the attributes of an entity - that is, the content of the row - define one particular object, an
					instance of the entity. So, &#8220;name&#8221; and &#8220;area&#8221; are attributes of &#8220;island&#8221;
					generally, but &#8220;Tahiti&#8221; and &#8220;1048&#8221; define a specific island; a row with those values is an
					instance of the &#8220;island&#8221; entity. Any table containing specific rows is said to be a <span class="keyword">table instance</span>.
				</p>
						
				<p>
					In addition to having a name, attributes also have a <span class="keyword">data type</span>, such as number, text,
					image, and so on. (We haven't been concerned about data types so far.) The data type defines the form of the
					information that can be stored in a field. By specifying the data type, database software can prevent us from
					accidentally storing bad information in a table. To connect the data type to the tagging discussed earlier, think
					of the type as a tag attribute, as in <code>&lt;name type="text"&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;area type="number"&gt;</code>, though database
					software uses other forms of metadata to record the data type.

				<div class="fluency-bit">
					<strong class="fluency-bit-title">For the Record. </strong>Because databases are so important and long-studied, the

					quintuple, sextuple, and septuple. Rows are often called <span class="keyword">records</span>, a holdover from computing's punch-card
					days. Attributes are also known as <span class="keyword">fields</span> and <span class="keyword">columns</span>; an attribute's data type is sometimes

			<section class="subsection" data-number="12" data-name="Properties of Entities">		
				<h3>Properties of Entities</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="first-sentence">One curious property of a relational database table is that it can be empty.</span> That is, the table has no
					rows. (Visualize the idea by deleting the last four rows of the table in Figure 16.4.) It seems odd, but it
					makes sense. Once we agree that an entity is anything defined by a specific set of attributes, then in principle
					a table exists with a name and column headings. When we specify entity instances, we'll have rows. So, among the
					instances of any table is the &#8220;empty instance.&#8221;
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="property">Instances are unordered. </span>Each distinct table is a different table instance.
					Two table instances will have a different set of rows. And, tables with the same rows, but reordered - that
					is, the same rows are listed in different sequence, say one sorted and the other unsorted - are the same table instance. Thus, the order of the rows
					doesn't matter in databases. We need to list them in some order, of course, but any order will do.
				</p>
						
				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">483</div>
				
				<p>
					The attributes (columns) are also considered to be unordered, though we must list them in some order. Since
					the attributes have a name - think of the column heading or the tag - they do not have to be tracked by
					position.
				</p>
				<p>
					Notice that the columns are unordered and the rows are unordered, but that doesn't mean that data in the
					table can go anywhere. Columns stay as columns, because they embody a kind of data being stored, and the items
					in a row stay as a row, because they are descriptive of an individual entity. The freedom to move the data is
					limited to exchanging entire rows or exchanging entire columns.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="property">Uniqueness. </span>There are few limits on what an entity can be. Things that can be
					identified or distinguished from each other based on a fixed set of attributes qualify as entities, which covers
					almost everything. Amoebas are not entities, because they have no characteristics that allow us to tell them
					apart. (Perhaps amoebas can tell each other apart, and if we could figure out how, then the characteristics on
					which they differ could be their attributes, allowing them to become entities.) Of course, one-celled animals
					are entities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because entities can be distinguished by their attributes, they are unique. Accordingly, in a database
					table no two rows can be the same. Unique instances is usually what we intend when we set up a database. For
					example, the database containing information about registered students at a college intends for each
					row - corresponding to a student - to be unique since the students are. When we set up the database, we
					ensure that we store information that uniquely identifies each student - such as name, birth date, parents'
					names, and permanent address.
				</p>
				<p>
					In cases where the entities are unique but it is difficult to process the information, we might select an
					alternate encoding. For example, killer whales can be distinguished by the arrangement of their black-and-white
					markings. Even though images can be stored in a database, it is difficult to compare two images to determine if
					they show the same whale. So, we assign names to the killer whales, which are easy to manipulate, letting a
					human do the recognition and assign the name.
				</p>
				<p>Notice that the two rows can have the same value for some attributes, just not all attributes.</p>
				<p>
					<span class="property">Keys. </span>The fact that no two rows in a database table are identical motivates us
					to ask which attributes distinguish them. In most cases, there will be several possibilities. Single attributes
					might be sufficient, like island name, or pairs of attributes like island name and archipelago name may be
					needed if certain island names, like Santa Maria, are common. Or we may have to consider three or more
					attributes taken together to ensure uniqueness. Any set of attributes for which all entities are different is
					called a <span class="keyword">candidate key</span>. Because database tables usually have several candidate
					keys, we choose one and call it the primary key. The <span class="keyword">primary key</span> is the one that the database system will use to
					decide uniqueness.
				</p>
		
				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">484</div>
				
				<p>
					Notice that candidate keys qualify only if they distinguish among all entities forever, not just those that
					are in the table at the moment, that is, the given instance. For example, all currently registered college
					students might have different names (first, middle, and last taken together), making the name attribute unique
					for the current class. But, as we know, there are many people with identical names, and so that triple is not an
					actual candidate key.
				</p>
				<p>
					If no combination of attributes qualifies as a candidate key, then a unique ID must be assigned to each
					entity. That's why your school issues students IDs: Some other student might match you on all of the attributes
					that the school records in its database, but because the school doesn't want to worry about the possibility of
					two distinct students matching on its key, it issues an ID number to guarantee that one attribute distinguishes
					each student.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="property">Atomic data. </span>In addition to requiring a description of each attribute's type
					of data - for example, number, text, or date - databases also treat the information as <span class="keyword">atomic</span>, that is, not decomposable into any smaller parts. So, for example, an address
					value
				</p>
				<code>1234 Sesame Street</code>
				<p>
					is treated in a database table as a single sequence of ASCII characters; the street number and the street
					name cannot be separated. This is why forms -  both paper and Web - have separate fields for street,
					city, state, and postal code: Most uses of address information must manipulate the city, state, and postal code
					information independently, which means the data must be assigned to separate fields.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The &#8220;only atomic data&#8221; rule is usually relaxed for certain types of data, such as dates, time,
					and currency. Strictly speaking, a date value 01/01/1970 must be treated as a single unity; any use of the date
					that refers to the month alone has to store the date as three attributes: day, month, and year. But database
					software usually bends the rules, allowing us to specify the format of the data attribute, say dd/mm/yyyy, which
					allows the program to understand how the field decomposes. This format saves us the trouble of manipulating
					three attributes.

				<h3>Database Schemes</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="first-sentence">Though tags may be a precise way to specify the structure of a table, it is a cumbersome way to define a table.</span>
					Accordingly, database systems specify a table as a <span class="keyword">database scheme</span> or <span class="keyword">database schema</span>.
					The scheme is a collection of table definitions that gives the name of the table, lists the attributes and their data types, and identifies the primary key. Each database system has
					specific requirements for how a scheme is presented, so there are no universal rules. We use an informal
					approach in which the attributes are given by their name, a data type, and a comment describing the meaning of
					the field. Figure 16.5 shows a database scheme for the Island table.

				<h3>XML Trees and Entities</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="first-sentence">As mentioned earlier, relational database tables and XML trees are not the same.</span> A full explanation of the
					differences is for database experts, but basically relational databases are more restrictive than XML trees; the
					limits make them more powerful and allow them to do more for us, as you'll soon see. For us, the main difference
					concerns the Collection Rule: When entity instances are grouped, all entities within the tag must have the same
					structure, because that structure defines the attributes that make up a row.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, the Island table for the Gal&aacute;pagos in Figure 16.4, which is a legal relational database
					table, can be encoded in XML as shown in the answer to Try It Exercise 16.1 on page 505. So, the relational
					formulation and the XML formulation are the same. But, when we added the <code>&lt;a_name&gt;</code> tags inside of the
					<code>&lt;archipelago&gt; </code>tags, we violated the relational requirement that all entities have the same structure: The
					<code>&lt;a_name&gt;</code> was not an<code> &lt;island&gt; </code>entity. Including the <code>&lt;a_name&gt;</code> tag made sense for XML, but not
					for the relational model. So, they are related but not identical.

				<h3>Database Tables Recap</h3>

					<span class="first-sentence">Summarizing the important points of the last few sections, tables in databases are not simply an
					arrangement of text, but rather they have a structure that is specified by metadata.</span> The structure of a database
					table is separate from its content. A table structures a set of entities - things that we can tell apart by
					their attributes - by naming the attributes and giving their data types. The entities of the table are
					represented as rows. We understand that rows and columns are unordered in databases, though when they are listed
					they have to be listed in some order. Tables and fields should have names that describe their contents, the
					fields must be atomic (i.e., indivisible), and one or more attributes define the primary key (i.e., field(s)
					with the property of having a different value for every row in any table instance ever).

		<section class="section" data-number="16" data-name="Operations on Tables">
			<h2>Operations on Tables</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="first-sentence">A database is a collection of database tables.</span> The main use of a database is to look up information. Users
				specify what they want to know and the database software finds it. For example, imagine a database containing
				Olympic records. There might be a table of participants for each Olympics, including attributes of name, country, and
				event; there might be a table of the medal winners for each Olympics, including attributes for the medal, the
				winner's name, the winner's country, and perhaps the score, distance, time, or other measure of the achievement.
				The database has many tables, but if we want to know how many marathon medalists have come from African countries,
				there is no table to look in - the table of medalists probably includes all winners in all sports, not just
				marathon winners from African countries. The data is in the database, but it's not stored in a single table where
				we, or the computer, can look it up. What we need to do is describe the information we want in such a way that the
				computer can figure out how to find it for us.
			</p>
	
			<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">486</div>
			
			<p>
				<span class="keyword">Database operations</span> allow us to ask questions of a database in a way that lets the
				software find the answer for us. For example, we will ask for the number of African marathon winners by asking:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<em>Put together the medalists for all of the Olympic Games (the operation will be called union), find the rows
				of medalists who won in the marathon (the operation will be called select), and pick out those who come from
				African countries (the operation will be called join). Count the resulting rows, which is the answer we want.</em>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This example illustrates two important points. First, we can perform operations on tables to produce tables.
				It's analogous to familiar operations on numbers: Operations like addition combine two numbers and produce another
				number; operations like union combine two tables and produce another table. Second, the questions we ask of a
				database are answered with a whole table. If the question has a single answer - who won the marathon in
				2000? - then the table instance answering the question will have only a single row. Generally there will be
				several answers forming the table. Of course, if there is no answer, the table will be empty.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In this section we illustrate the idea of combining tables to produce new tables. For this example, we
				imagine a table of the countries of the world as might be used by a travel agency. Its structure and sample
				entries are shown in Figure 16.6. Using that table, Nations, we'll investigate the five fundamental operations
				that can be performed on tables: Select, Project, Union, Difference, and Product.

					<span class="first-sentence">The Select operation takes rows from one table to create a new table.</span> Generally we specify the Select

					syntax:
				</p>		
				
				<p>Select <em>Test</em> From <em>Table</em></p>
				
				<p>
					The <em>Test</em> is to be applied to each row of the given table to decide if the row should be included in the
					new result table. The <em>Test</em> is a short formula that tests attribute values. It is written using attribute
					names, constants like numbers or letter strings, and the relational operators &lt;, &le;, &ne;, =, &ge;, &gt;.

					(pronounced pro &middot; JECT) is the operation that builds a new table from the columns of an existing table. We only

				<code><strong>Project</strong> <em>Field_List</em> <strong>From</strong> <em>Table</em></code>
				
				<p>
					For example, to create a new table from the Nations table without the capital and position

				</p>
				
				<code> <strong>Project</strong> Name, Domain, Interest <strong>From</strong> Nations </code>

					Project does not <em>always</em> result in a table with the same number of rows as the original table. When the
					new table includes a key from the old table (e.g., Name), the key makes each row distinct, so the new table will
					include fields from all rows of the original table. But if some of the new table's rows are the same - which
					can't happen if key columns are included, but can if there is no key among the chosen columns - they will be
					merged together into a single row. The rows have to be merged because of the rule that the rows of any table
					must always be distinct. If rows in one table are merged, the two tables will, of course, have different numbers
					of rows. So, for example, to list the Interest descriptions that travel agents use to summarize countries, we
					create a new table of only the last column of Nations.
				</p>
				
				<code> <strong>Project</strong> Interest <strong>From</strong> Nations </code>
				
				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">489</div>
				
				<p>
					This produces a one-column table with a row for each descriptive word: Beach appears once, Mountains
					appears once, and so on. Thus, the table has as many rows as unique words, and because of merging, it does not have as many rows as Nations.
				</p>
				<p>
					We often use Select and Project operations together to &#8220;trim&#8221; base tables to keep only some of
					the rows and some of the columns. To illustrate, we define a table of the countries with northern capitals,
					called Northern, and define it with the command
				</p>
				<code> At60OrAbove = (<strong>Select</strong> Latitude &ge; 60 AND N_S = 'N' <strong>From</strong> Nations)</code>
				<p>
					which is the table we created earlier. To throw away everything except the name, domain, and latitude to
					produce Northern, we write
				</p>
				<code> Northern = (<strong>Project</strong> Name, Domain, Latitude <strong>From</strong> At60OrAbove) </code>
		
				<p>as shown in Figure 16.9.</p>

				<p>
					First a temporary table is created with the four countries, just as before. Then the desired columns are

					and <code>Difference</code> to contain only the intended information. This is a powerful approach that we
					will use repeatedly in later sections.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					To illustrate, suppose your traveling companions volunteer to tutor students preparing for the National
					Geographic Society's Geography Bee. Each friend agrees to tutor students "on their part of the world," that is,
					in the quarter ofthe planet from which they come. So, Isabella, who comes from Argentina in the southern and
					western hemispheres, agrees to tutor students on the geography of that part of the world, and so on. Then you
					can produce a master list of who's responsible for each country. We'll call it the <code>Master</code>
					table. It is produced by these commands:
				</p>
		
				<div class="clear"></div>

				<code>
					<pre>
Super  = Nations X Travelers
Assign = (Select N_S = 'S' AND E_W = 'W'
		  AND Friend = 'Isabella' From Super) 
	   + (Select N_S = 'S' AND E_W = 'E'
		  AND Friend = 'Brian' From Super) 
	   + (Select N_S = 'N' AND E_W = 'E'
		  AND Friend = 'Wen' From Super) 
	   + (Select N_S = 'N' AND E_W = 'W'
		  AND Friend = 'Clare' From Super) 
Master = Project Name, Friend From Assign
					</pre> 
				</code>

				<p>
					Notice that we have used <code>Product</code> (<code>X</code>), <code>Union</code> (+),
					<code>Select</code>, and
					<code>Project</code>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					How do these commands work? The <code>Super</code> table is the product table dis-cussed earlier with a row
					for each nation paired with each friend (see Figure16.12). Then the <code>Assign</code> table is created by
					the <code>Union</code> operation (+) that com-bines four tables, each created by a <code>Select</code>
					operation from <code>Super</code>. The first <code>Select</code> keeps only those countries from <code>Super</code>
					with Isabella's name that are also in the southern and western hemispheres. The second <code>Select</code>
					keeps only those countries from <code>Super</code> with Brian's name that are in the southern and
					easternhemispheres. The same kind of operations are used for Wen and Clare. The resulting <code>Assign</code>
					table has 230 rows-the same as the original <code>Nations</code> table-with one of your friends' names
					assigned to each country.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					We know that all of the countries are in the <code>Assign</code> table because every coun-try is in one of
					the four hemisphere pairs, and in <code>Super</code> there is a row for each country for each friend. When
					the right combination "comes up," the country will be chosen by one of the four <code>Selects</code>. In
					addition, <code>Assign</code> has the property that each person is given countries in "their" part of the
					world. (Wen has beenassigned the greatest amount of work!) Finally, we throw away all of the loca-tion
					information to create our <code>Master</code> list, keeping only the names of the countries and the friends
					responsible for tutoring students about that geogra-phy. Part of the result is shown in Figure 16.13.
				</p>

					We have introduced five basic operations on tables. They are straightforwardand simple. It is surprising,
					therefore, that these five are the only operations needed to create any table in a relational database. In

					<span class="first-sentence">Join combines two tables, like the Product operation does, but it doesn't necessarily produce all

					only the rows from the given tables that match on those fields, not all pairings of rows, as does Product. We
					write the Join operation as follows:

				<code>Table1 <img class="symbol" src="/contents/fluency/images/join.png" alt="joinSymbol"> Table2 <strong>On</strong> Match</code>
		
				
				<p>
					The unusual "bow tie" symbol suggests a special form of Product in which the two tables "match up." <em>Match</em>
					is a comparison test involving fields from each table, which when true for a row from each table produces a
					result row that is their concatenation. To refer to attributes in each table, we use the notation <em>Table.Field</em>,
					as in <code>Master.Name</code>.

					Iceland, and Norway. We combine those four rows with their corresponding rows in Northern to produce the
					four-row result shown inFigure 16.14. As you see, Join associates the information from the rows of two tables in
					a sensible way. Thus, Join is used to create new associations of infor-mation in the database.

				<p>
					There are at least two ways to think about the Join operation. One way is to see it as a "lookup" operation
					on tables. That is, for each row in one table, locate a row (or rows) in the other table with the same value in
					the common field; if found, combine the two; if not, look up the next row. That's how we explained it in the
					last paragraph. Another way is to see it as a Product operation forming all pairs of the two tables, and then
					eliminating all rows that don't match in the common fields. Both ideas accurately describe the result, and the
					computer probably uses still another approach to produce the Join table.
				</p>
				
				<p>

			<h2>Structure of a Database</h2>
			
			<p>
				<span class="first-sentence">You have learned that by using the five primitive operations and Join we can create tables from tables to
				answer questions from a database.</span> But usually these operations are used in a slightly different way. We don't
				usually ask a single question and quit. Rather, we want to arrange the information of adatabase in a way that
				users see a relevant-to-their-needs view of the data that they will use continually. Figure 16.15 shows a
				schematic of this idea.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In Figure 16.15 you see that there are two forms of tables. The physical data-base, stored on the disk drives of
				the computer system, is the permanent repository of the database. The logical database, also known as the<em>
				view of the database</em>, is created for users on-the-fly and is customized for their needs. Why do we use this
				two-level solution? The answer requires that we look a little closer at the two groups of tables.
			</p>
			
			<section class="subsection" data-number="27" data-name="Physical and Logical Databases">
				<h3>Physical and Logical Databases</h3>
				
				<p>
					<span class="first-sentence">The point of the two-level system is to separate the management of the data, which is typically done at the
					physical database level, from the presentation of the data, which typically involves many different versions for
					many different users.</span>
				</p>

						<span class="figureId">Figure 16.15</span> Structure of a database system. The physical database is the
						permanent repository of the data; the logical database, or view of the database, is the form of the database
						the users see. The transformation is implemented by the query processor, and is based on queries that define
						the logical database tables from the physical database tables.
					</p>
				</figcaption>
				
				<p>
					<span class="property">Physical database.</span> The physical database is designed by database
					administra-tors so that the data is fast to access. More importantly, the physical databaseis set up to avoid
					redundancy, that is, duplicating information. It seems obvi-ous that data should not be stored repeatedly
					because it will waste space, but disk space is <em>extremely </em>cheap, implying that that isn't the reason to
					avoid redundancy. Rather, if data is stored in multiple places in the physical database, there is a
					chance - possibly, a good chance - that when it's changed in one place, it will not be changed in every other place
					where it is stored. This causes the data to become <em>inconsistent</em>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					For example, if your school stores your home address, and your major depart-ment also stores a separate
					copy of your address, then when you notify the school of your new residence, both addresses should be changed.
					But, with multiple copies, that might not occur. If the database contains two different addresses for you, then
					the school has no idea which address is correct; per-fectly good information gets turned into garbage because it
					is inconsistent.For this reason, database administrators make sure that there is only one copy of each piece of
					data. That is, data is not stored redundantly.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					It might seem risky to keep only one copy of the data: What happens if itaccidentally gets deleted or the disk
					crashes? Database administrators worry about this problem all the time, and have a process of making backup
					copies of the database, which they store in a safe place, <em>never to be used</em>. That is, until the data is
					accidentally deleted or the disk crashes-in other words-when the other copy is gone. There is still only one
					copy.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Avoiding redundancy is obviously good, but keeping one copy seems to ignore the fact that multiple users
					need the information. The administration needs to send tuition bills, the dean needs to send notification that
					you "made the list,"and the Sports Center needs to send you the picture of your photo finish;
				</p>
				
				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">498</div>
			
				<p>they all need your address. Where do they get their copy? That's where the logical database comes in.</p>
				
				<p>
					<span class="property">Logical database.</span> The logical database shows users the view of the
					informa-tion that they need and want. It doesn't exist permanently, but is created for them fresh every time
					they look at it. This solves the problem of getting everyone a copy of the address. It's retrieved from the one
					copy stored in the physical database, and provided to the users as needed, fresh every time.Creating a new copy
					each time is essential, because if it were to be created once and then stored on the user's computer, then there
					would be two copies of the information again-the copy in the physical database and the one in thelogical
					database-making the data redundantly stored. So, it never stays onthe user's computer; it's always recreated. As
					a result, when you notify the administration that you moved in the morning, the dean can send you a
					con-gratulatory letter in the afternoon and have your correct address.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The other advantage of creating specialized versions of the database for each user is that different users
					want to see different information. For example, theSports Center needs to record a student's locker number, but
					no other unit on campus cares. Similarly, the fact that a student is on academic probation is information that
					most users of the school's database don't need to know, and it should not be included in their view. In
					principle, each user wants a different view of the database.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<span class="property">Queries.</span> Queries are the key to making this two-level organization work. Each
					user group, say the dean's office, needs a version of the database created for them. For each user table a query
					is formulated. A <span class="keyword">query</span> is a specification using the five operations and Join that define a
					table from other tables. Think of the query as being written as described in the previous sections, but it is
					actually written in the standard database language <span class="keyword">SQL</span>, short for <span class="keyword">Structured
					Query Language</span>. Then, when the dean clicks on the table of Spring Term Grades, the database system runs the
					query that defines that table, creating it and displaying it to the dean. It probably doesn't exist in that form
					in the physi-cal database, but Select, Project, and the other operations can define how to create it from the
					data that is physically stored. On the next day, when the dean opens the table of Spring Term Grades again, a
					new copy will be created, which means that the grade change made the previous afternoon by some physics
					pro-fessor (and stored in the physical database) will be visible to the dean.
				</p>
		
				<p>It all seems pretty complicated, but it is not. Indeed, in the next section youwill see that it is all rather straightforward.</p>

					other campus units will want to access the address information, but they shouldn't have access to all of the
					information (especially the sensitive information) about each student. The addresses are stored in a different
					table, the <code>Home_Base</code> table, which can have a lower security rating. Though these two tables are separate, they
					are not independent. The <code>Student_ID</code> connects each row in <code>Student</code> with his or her address in Home_Base. We say
					that there is a relationship between the two entities.

				<p>
					<span class="property">The idea of relationships.</span> A <span class="keyword">relationship</span> is a correspondence
					between rows of one table and the rows of another table. Relationships are part of the meta-data of a database,
					and because they are critical to building the logical data-base from the physical database, we give them names
					and characterize their properties.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The relationship between <code>Student</code> and <code>Home_Base</code> - that
					is, for each row in <code>Student</code> there is a single row in <code>Home_Base</code>
					(found by the <code>Student_ID</code>) - will be 
					called <em>Lives_At.</em> Setting up the tables in this way is largely equivalent to stor-ing the address in
					<code>Student</code>, but not all relationships are so close. This one is especially close because it is based on the
					<code>Student_ID</code>, which is the key for both tables. (Recall that keys are unique, meaning no two rows can have the
					same value.) The <em>Lives_At</em> relationship is said to be one-to-one.
				</p>
				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">501</div>		
				<p>
					Because we used the key <code>Student_ID</code> in both tables, we not only can find the address for each student, but we can
					also find the student for each address.That is, there is a second relationship in the opposite direction, which
					we can call <em>Home_Of</em>, meaning that the home base entry is the address of the student who has that ID.
					Like <em>Lives At, Home_Of</em> is a one-to-one relationship,because each row in <code>Home_Base</code>
					corresponds to a single row in Student.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<span class="property">Relationship examples.</span> Familiar relationships that we encounter every day
					illustrate that their description often ends with a preposition.
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><em>Father Of,</em> the relationship between a man and his child</li>
					<li><em>Daughter Of,</em> the relationship between a girl and her parent</li>
					<li><em>Employed_By,</em> the relationship between people and companies</li>
					<li><em>Stars_In,</em> the relationship between actors and movies</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					Names of database relationships should be meaningful to help people workingwith the database, but like all
					names in computing, the computer doesn't know whether the name makes sense or not.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<span class="property">Relationships in practice.</span> Database software systems need to know what
					rela-tionships exist among the tables if they are to help us create the logical data-bases. The systems allow us
					to define relationships among tables. The detailsare specific to each system, of course, but the example of <em>Lives_At
					</em>and <em>Home_Of</em> are shown in Figure 16.17 as they would appear in Microsoft Access.

				</p>
				
				<p>
					<span class="property">Constrution using <strong>Join</strong>.</span> The relationships between the <code>Student</code> 
					and <code>Home_Base</code> tables allow us to construct a single table, <code>Master_List</code>,
					which contains the combined information from both tables. How? Using the natural Join operation, described
					earlier in this chapter. Recall that the natural Joincreates a table out of two other tables by joining rows
					that match - it's an equality test - on specified fields. Thus, we write
				</p>
				
				<code><pre>
Master_List = Student <img class="symbol" src="/contents/fluency/images/join.png" alt="joinSymbol"/>	 Home_Base
			  <strong>On</strong> Student.Student_ID = Home_Base.Student_ID
				</pre></code>
					
				<p>
					where the match is on the common field of <code>Student_ID</code>. Fields of the resulting table are shown in Figure
					16.18. We don't lose anything by storing the basic student information in one table and the addresses in
					another, because with this simple command, we can create a table that recombines the information just as if it
					were stored in a single table.

				<p>
					The important idea here is that although we chose to store the information in two tables, we never lost the
					association of the information because we keptthe <code>Student_ID</code> with the
					addresses. The relationship <em>Lives_At</em> lets us connecteach student with his or her address by the <code>
					Student_ID</code>. The approach gives usthe flexibility to arrange tables so as to avoid
					problems of redundancy—though we haven't demonstrated that benefit yet—while keeping track of important
					information, like where a person lives.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<span class="property">Practical construction using QBE.</span> Though it wasn't difficult to write the
					natu-ral Join query in the last section to create the <code>Master_List</code> table,
					database systems can make it even easier for us. A technique developed at IBM in the1970s, called<span class="keyword"> Query By
					Example (QBE)</span>, is available to us in the Microsoft Access system. Basically, the software gives us a template
					of a table, and we fill in what we want in the fields. That is, we give an example of what we want inthe table,
					referencing fields from other tables that have already been defined.The software then figures out a query that
					creates the table from the sample table. It couldn't be easier! Figure 16.19 shows the QBE query window that
					will create <code>Master_List</code>.
				</p>
				
				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">503</div>
				
				<p>
					The database software automatically creates the query needed for Master_List.What query did it create? We can
					ask and find out what it generated; seeFigure 16.20. The query is expressed in SQL, the standard database
					querylanguage. If we could read SQL - it's actually not too hard - we'd see that thisquery is the query we created
					above for <code>Master_List</code>.

					full home addresses. (Someone else in the dean's office will need them.) The students' home towns are enough

					<code>Home_Base</code>, the college's currentaddress list. The information for each student
					must be associated to create the <code>Deans_View</code> table, and the <code>Join</code> operation is
					the key to doing it. The expression

					<span class="property">Trim the table.</span> The resulting table contains too much information, of course,
					because it has all the columns from the three tables. The dean doesn't want to see so much information. So, the
					second step is to retrieve only the columns the dean wants to see.
				</p>
				
				<p>The Project operation retrieves columns:</p>

				<div class="clear"></div>
				
				<code><pre>
Deans_View =
   <strong>Project</strong> Nickname, First_Name, Last_Name, Birthdate<
		   City, State, Major, Grade_Point, Factoid, Summer_Plans
   <strong>From</strong>    Dean_Data_Collect
				</pre></code>
				
				<p>
					In English, the query says, "Save the Nickname column, First_Name column,and so forth, from the table,
					<code>Dean_Data_Collect</code>, that is formed by joining - that is, associating on <code>Student_ID</code> - the
					three tables <code>Top_Scholar</code>, <code>Student</code>, and <code>Home_Base</code> ." 
					This is precisely what the dean wants. The query defines the
					<code>Deans_View</code> table. Although the dean probably thinks the table exists physically, it is created fresh every time
					it's needed.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The join-then-trim strategy used to create the Dean's View is a standard approach to creating logical
					tables: a supertable is formed by joining several physical tables. These are then trimmed down to keep only the
					information of interest to the user. The <code>Deans_View</code> query used <code>Project</code>, but <code>Select</code> and <code>Difference</code> are also
					frequently used.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<span class="property">Software creates dean's view</span>. If we add <code>Top_Scholar</code>
					to the Access database schema given in Figure 16.16, and include the one-to-one relationship between it and the
					other tables based on the <code>Student_ID</code>, as shown in Figure 16.17, then we can use Query By Example again to define
					the Dean's View,saving ourselves the effort of working out our own query, though writing SQL directly wouldn't
					be that difficult. Figure 16.23 shows the QBE window from Microsoft Access that defines the Dean's View from the
					three tables.

					For the record, the SQL query that Access produced for us based on our example from Figure 16.23 is shown
					in Figure 16.24. It is the identical query we developed ourselves, expressed in SQL syntax. (Notice that SQL
					uses the word "Select" where we used "Project"; the concepts are the same, but the term is different between the
					theory of relational databases and the SQL language. This naming inconsistency is an annoying feature of the
					study of databases.)

				<span class="first-sentence">In this chapter we followed a path from XML tagging through to the con-struction of logical views using QBE.</span>
				You learned a lot, including:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>XML tags are an effective way to record metadata in a file.</li>
				<li>Metadata is used to identify values, can capture the affinity among values of the same entity, and can collect together a group of entity instances.</li>
				<li>Database tables have names and fields that describe the attributes of the entity contained in the table.</li>
				<li>The data that quantitatively records each property has a specific datatype and is atomic.</li>
				<li>There are five fundamental operations on tables: Select, Project,Union, Difference, and Product. These operations are the only ones you need to create new tables from other database tables.</li>
				<li>Join is an especially useful operation that associates information from separate tables in new ways, based on matching fields.</li>
				<li>Relationships are the key to associating fields of the physical database.</li>
				<li>The physical database resides on the disk drive; it avoids storing data redundantly and is optimized for speed.</li>
				<li>The main approach for creating logical views from physical data isthe join-and-trim technique.</li>
				<li>There is a direct connection between the theoretical ideas of data-base tables and the software of database systems.</li>
