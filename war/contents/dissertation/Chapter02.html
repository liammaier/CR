				Population: Adults with Acquired Brain Injury
			</h2>

			<p>
				This focus of this study is adults with reading comprehension problems after 
				acquired brain injury (ABI). ABI can occur from a number of causes that generally fall 
				into two categories: traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and non-traumatic brain injuries
				(Brain Injury Association of America of America, n.d; BIAA). Traumatic brain injuries are 
				those sustained via external damage to the head such as from falls, sports concussions, 
				gunshot wounds, or motor vehicle accidents
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="80">(Lezak, 1995;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="81">Lezak et al., 2012;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="85">Luria, 1975)</span>.
				Non-traumatic injuries are those acquired from other sources of neurological 
				damage. Examples from this category include medical issues such as brain tumors or 
				strokes; toxicity such as from poisoning or drug overdoses; or deprivation of oxygen to 
				the brain (i.e. anoxia) such as from near-drowning
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="80">(Lezak, 1995;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="81">Lezak, et al., 2012;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="85">Luria, 1975)</span>.
				Additional non-traumatic neurological damage can also result from medical 
				interventions such as chemotherapy and radiation, or surgical interventions
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="81">(Butler et al., 2009;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="81">Lezak, et al., 2012)</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Given the diverse mechanisms of injury, the impairment profiles of adults with 
				ABI are also diverse. A common problem following ABI with the potential to impact 
				reading comprehension is cognitive impairments
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="80">(Lezak, 1995;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="81">Lezak, et al., 2012;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="112">Sohlberg & Turkstra, 2011)</span>.
				Cognitive impairments include problems with attention, working memory, and executive functions
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="80">(Lezak, et al., 2012;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Sohlberg & Mateer, 2001)</span>.
				These key cognitive functions are critical in the selection and organization of 
				incoming information; in the retrieval and transfer of information to and from long-term

				Individuals with impaired attention from acquired brain injury may have difficulty 
				focusing on tasks, selecting relevant stimuli, sustaining attention over time, or alternating 
				attention between multiple stimuli
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="119">(Sohlberg & Mateer, 2001)</span>. Problems with working 
				memory may challenge individuals’ abilities to retain incoming content long enough to 
				do something meaningful with it; working memory deficits may also involve an inability 
				to suppress or “clear” irrelevant information ultimately exhausting available capacity 
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="6">(Baddeley, 2000;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">2002;</span>

					<span class="cite-use" data-ref="112">Sohlberg & Turkstra, 2011)</span>. 
				Executive dysfunction may impair individuals’ abilities to self-monitor thinking and 
				behavior, and/or to self-regulate goal-directed behaviors 
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="68">(Kennedy & Coelho, 2005;</span>

					<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Sohlberg & Mateer, 2001)</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Deficits in attention, working memory and executive processes may stem from a 
				variety of mechanisms of injury with damage to diverse areas of the brain
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="81">(Lezak et al., 2012)</span>. For the purposes of reading to learn, attention, working memory and executive 
				functions are interdependent; they are all required for the selection and organization of 
				incoming information; the retrieval and transfer of information to and from long-term 
				memory; and the active manipulation, integration and construction of information 
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="6">(Baddeley, 2000;</span>

			<p>
				The reading comprehension intervention developed and evaluated in the current 
				study aimed to compensate for the effects of cognitive impairments on reading to learn.
				However, a number of other factors can and do contribute to difficulties with reading

				impairments, reading comprehension may be impacted by ongoing somatic issues such as 
				chronic pain, psychosocial factors such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression 
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="63">(Hoge et al., 2008)</span>. Other factors such as level of background knowledge, motivation for 
				reading or attending school, and availability of supports can also impact reading 
				comprehension performance

				Comprehension Theory: Structure Building Framework 
			</h2>

			<p>
				What happens during the reading comprehension process varies depending on the 
				characteristics of three elements: the reader, the text and the activity, and the 
				sociocultural context where those elements interact
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="106">(RRSG, 2002)</span>. This study evaluated
				an intervention designed to assist (a) adult readers with acquired brain injury, (b) reading 
				expository text, (c) for the purposes of learning new content—as would be expected in 
				post-secondary academic contexts. The RAND Reading Study Group stressed that 
				researchers must incorporate all three elements in their studies while also grounding

				research in available theory, even as the models continue to evolve
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="106">(2002)</span>. Theoretical 
				models should be logically sound and empirically validated
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="106">(RRSG, 2002;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="112">Sadoski & Paivio, 2007)</span>.
				Particularly important for intervention research, theoretical models should 
				also be clinically useful for framing the selection and evaluation of intervention 
				components
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="106">(RRSG, 2002;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="112">Sadoski & Paivio, 2007)</span>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Ideally, a model would conceptualize reading comprehension of expository text, 
				and be validated on a range of populations that included both skilled and unskilled 
				readers. Even more, the ideal model would account for individual differences within the 
				ABI population and take into account other important aspects of the sociocultural context 
				that could influence reading. This ideal model would conceptualize the entire process in 
				such a way that points of entry for intervention could be identified, and that support the
				rationale for why a proposed intervention might work. A single model that meets these 
				criteria does not exist thus it was necessary to integrate theory across models. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Perhaps the most seminal reading model from the cognitive psychology literature 
				is the construction-integration model
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="35">(CI model; Kintsch, 1988, 1998)</span>. The CI model 
				conceptualizes comprehension occurring in two phases: construction and integration
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="35">(Kintsch, 1988, 1998)</span>. The construction phase of the CI model begins through bottom-up 
				activation of propositions in long-term memory by incoming propositions that have 
				overlapping arguments with prior knowledge. With continued incoming information, 
				activation spreads to entire networks—or schemas—of specific content knowledge stored 
				in long-term memory
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="35">(Kintsch, 1988, 1998)</span>. Integration occurs in the CI model between 
				incoming content and existing background knowledge as similarities and differences 
				either reinforce existing links or result in the formation of new links. The strength of the

				final activation, based on a connectionist algorithm, determines how well new content is 
				stored in long-term memory
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="35">(Kintsch, 1988, 1998)</span>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				A limitation of the CI model for intervention research is that validation has 
				primarily focused on successful comprehenders
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="35">(Kintsch, 1988, 1994, 1998)</span>. Although 
				the model does explain why readers who have more background knowledge are better 
				comprehenders than readers with less background knowledge
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="35">(Kintsch, 1988, 1998;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="135">van Dijk & Kintsch, 1983)</span>;</span>
				the model does not adequately account for differences in how 
				good versus poor comprehenders approach reading, except to say that these readers have 
				differences in background knowledge
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="48">(Graesser, 2007)</span>. Despite a key assumption of the 
				model that background knowledge includes knowledge of strategies required to
				accomplish different construction and integration processes, the description of how those 
				strategies are employed is vague
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="135">(van Dijk, & Kintsch, 1983;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="48">Graesser, 2007)</span>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Multiple models have evolved from the seminal framework provided by the CI 
				model more useful for intervention research
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(e.g. Gernsbacher, 1991;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="47">Goldman, Varma, & Cote, 1996;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="51">Graesser, Swamer, Baggett, & Sell, 1996;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="139">Zwann & Radvansky, 1998)</span>. 
				The structure building framework (SBF) is one example
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997)</span>. Like 
				many models of comprehension, the goal of comprehension in the structure building 
				framework is to build a coherent mental representation, or structure, of what is read. 
				Coherence describes how all of the ideas of a text fit together to form a thematic whole 
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="57">(Halliday & Hasan, 1976;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="60">Hasan, 1984)</span>. When readers have a coherent understanding of 
				an expository text, they have a logical, organized understanding of what the main idea of 
				a text was, and how ideas were presented to support that idea
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Hasan, 1998;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="82">Long & Chong, 2001;</span>

				understanding of the text evolves over time at two different levels: globally and locally 
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="50">(Graesser et al., 2003;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="74">Kintsch, 2004;</span>
				Lorch, 1995)</span>. The ability develop a coherent 
				understanding of discourse is tied to the cohesiveness of the discourse. Local coherence 
				develops through the use of cohesive devices, such as pronouns or conjunctions, to 
				enable recognition of the relationship between common constituents between sentences in 
				close proximity to one another
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="49">(Graesser & Forsyth, 1997;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="74">Kintsch, 2004;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="75">Kintsch & van Dijk, 1978)</span>.
				Global coherence develops as ideas within a text are related to the overall 
				theme or structure of the text; that is, the global cohesiveness
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="49">(Graesser & Forsyth, 1997; </span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="74">Kintsch, 2004;</span>
					<span class="cite-use" data-ref="75">Kintsch & van Dijk, 1978)</span>. The global cohesiveness of discourse occurs 
				through the use of <em>macrostructural elements</em>. In narrative discourse macrostructural 
				element, also known as story grammar components—include characters, the setting, a 
				problem, and a resolution
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Coelho, 2002)</span>.  
			</p>

			<p>
				According to the SBF, reading comprehension begins through the activation of 
				memory nodes stimulated by incoming information
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997)</span>. The 
				structure building process then evolves through three component processes: (a) laying a 
				foundation structure, (b) mapping incoming information onto the foundational structure, 
				and (c) shifting to establish new structures when incoming information is less coherent 
				with the previous information
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997)</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The SBF is centered upon two general cognitive processes that dominate many 
				connectionist theories of comprehension and cognition: enhancement and suppression
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997)</span>. In the SBF these two processes serve as mechanisms for 
				spreading or inhibiting activation during the process of building coherent mental 
				structures. A particular appeal of the SBF is that the model has been validated with both

				good and poor comprehenders. A second appeal is that it describes the comprehension 
				process in a way that suggests points of entry for intervention. A third appeal is that 
				converging evidence provides a strong rationale for guiding the intervention development 
				process, including studies of poor comprehenders within the context of this model, 
				findings from other studies that characterize similarly impaired processes in adults with 
				brain injuries, and outcome results on interventions that target these processes so may be 
				helpful to this population.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Characteristics of good comprehenders in the SBF</strong>. Good comprehenders are 
				able to form a coherent structural representation of a text
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="50">Graesser et al., 2003;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="57">Halliday & Hasan, 1976;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="74">Kintsch, 2004)</span>.
				As noted earlier, 
				coherence is not a property of the text; a coherent understanding is what writers bring to 
				the writing process as they write text, and what readers develop during reading process as 
				they read the text; cohesive devices support this process
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="57">(Halliday & Hasan, 1976;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="49">Graesser & Forsyth, 1997)</span>.
				The SBF describes how readers accomplish this goal.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong><em>Laying a foundation</em></strong>. Proficient readers begin the process of constructing a 
				coherent understanding by laying a foundation. Laying a foundation means they establish 
				a preliminary structure about the topic of the text
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991,1997)</span>. As readers 
				begin reading, the incoming information stimulates activation of related memory nodes
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997)</span>. Through enhancement and suppression processes this 
				activation spreads to enable retrieval of relevant background knowledge and topicspecific schema
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997)</span>. 
			</p>

			<div class="pagebreak">
				<span class="pageNumber">
					14
				</span>
			</div>

<!-- Page 15 -->

			<p>
				Evidence for laying a foundation comes from studies that show that participants 
				slow down when they encounter the first constituent of presented content
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="1">(Aaronson & Ferres, 1983;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Gernsbacher, 1996;</span>
					<span class="cite-use" data-ref="56">Haberlandt, 1984)</span>.
				For example, they read the first 
				sentence of a paragraph slower than the second sentence
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="56">(Haberlandt, 1984)</span>. This 
				phenomenon is the advantage of first mention
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Gernsbacher, 1988)</span>. First mentioned 
				elements are thought to be more accessible because they were used to lay the foundation 
				for comprehension. Readers are more likely to consider the first sentence of paragraph as 
				conveying the main idea, even when the theme is actually specified later in the paragraph 
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Gernsbacher, 1988;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="71">Kieras, 1981)</span>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong><em>Mapping ideas onto the foundation.</em></strong> After laying a foundation, proficient readers 
				continue the process of developing a coherent representation of the text by mapping
				relevant incoming information onto currently activated, existing structures
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997)</span>.
				Proficient readers accomplish this by recognizing the markers of cohesion in 
				the text
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="134">(van den Broek, Risden, & Husebey-Hartmann; 1995;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997)</span>. 
				The way sentences in a text are connected through overlapping ideas and other cohesive 
				devices help readers construct a coherent understanding of the text
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="57">(Halliday & Hasan, 1976)</span>.
				There are many types of cohesive devices; examples include the use of causal 
				connectors, such as because or the use of pronouns to refer to previously mentioned 
				ideas. In the SBF, recognition of cohesion particularly supports the construction of local 
				coherence
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991,1997)</span>. Proficient readers map adjacent ideas onto 
				currently activated structures to further develop and expand understanding
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997)</span>.  
			</p>

			<div class="pagebreak">
				<span class="pageNumber">
					15
				</span>
			</div>

<!-- Page 16 -->

			<p>
				Evidence from mapping comes from studies that show that proficient readers read 
				coherent information faster than they read incoherent information
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="4">(Anderson, Garrod & Sanford, 1983;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Gernsbacher, 1996;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="61">Haviland & Clark, 1974)</span>.
				Readers also read causally related clauses conjoined by causal connectors (e.g. because) more quickly than causally 
				related clauses not connected (e.g. I bought an umbrella. It was raining outside.).
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong><em>Shifting to create structures.</em></strong> Information that does not include local markers of 
				coherence (i.e. cohesion devices) would not be mapped onto currently activated 
				structures
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997)</span>. Such information may be irrelevant; proficient 
				readers are able to suppress irrelevant information
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997)</span>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				On the other hand, information not related to currently activated substructures 
				may still be related to the overall theme of a text. In this case, rather than suppressing the 
				information, proficient readers are able to shift away from currently activated structures 
				or substructures to begin the process of building new structures or substructures 
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997)</span>. One way proficient readers recognize that content is related 
				to the overall theme of the chapter is through macrostructural elements
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="35">(Kintsch, & van Dijk, 1978;></span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="83">Lorch, 1995)</span>.
				Macrostructures are the elements within the text that form the overall organization of the text
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="49">(Graesser, & Forsyth, 1997;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="35">Kintsch, & van Dijk, 1978)</span>. 
				For example, a table of contents and headings provides a macrostructure to orient readers 
				to how the content of a text is organized. Proficient readers detect macrostructural 
				elements (i.e. global cohesion devices) and reflect on this macrostructure as they read in 
				order to construct global coherence
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="49">(Graesser & Forsyth, 1997; Long & Chong, 2001)</span>.
				Good cohesion is necessary but not sufficient for good coherence. 
			</p>

			<div class="pagebreak">
				<span class="pageNumber">

				</span>
			</div>

<!-- Page 17 -->

			<p>
				As readers encounter information that does not fit the local structure but still 
				relates to the global macrostructure of the overall theme of a chapter, they shift to 
				construct new structures or substructures
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997)</span>. Evidence for 
				shifting comes from studies that show that when readers encounter content that changes 
				the topic or point of view, they take longer to comprehend it
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="4">(Anderson et al., 1983;</span> 
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="41">Gernsbacher, 1997;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="101">Olson, Duffy & Mack, 1984)</span>. Additional evidence shows that 
				information presented just before shifting is more difficult to recall than information 
				presented afterwards; this evidence suggests that the former structure is no longer 
				activated and that working memory is focused on the new structure
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="4">(Anderson et al., 1983; Clements, 1979)</span>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Characteristics of poor comprehenders in the SBF.</strong> A well-validated finding of 
				the SBF is that poor comprehenders are inefficient at suppression
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="41">(Gernsbacher, 1997;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="42">Gernsbacher & Faust, 1991;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="44">Gernsbacher, Varner, & Faust, 1999)</span>.
				According to the SBF, 
				poor readers particularly struggle with mapping because they have difficulty suppressing 
				irrelevant information. Overloaded with too much information, poor readers struggle to 
				detect cohesive markers and macrostructural elements needed to formulate a coherent 
				representation of the text. Because they are unable to see the relationships between ideas, 
				poor readers do not map new overlapping information onto already activated structures.
			</p>

			<p>
				Consequently, poor readers have a tendency to “overshift”
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="41">(Gernsbacher, 1997;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="44">Gernsbacher et al., 1999)</span>.
				Unable to integrate incoming information with either locally or 
				globally related content, they treat all information as new information. They may lay a 
				foundation when they encounter new information, but they never map related information

			<p class="noIndent">
				onto it. With each new foundation they lay, they forget content from previously activated 
				structures. 
			</p>

				Although suppression of irrelevant information cannot be directly targeted 
				through self-regulation (e.g. try to forget the image of a pink elephant), evidence from 
				studies of poor comprehenders shows poor readers benefit from enhancement of relevant 
				information
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="44">(Gernsbacher et al., 1999)</span>. Perhaps poor readers benefit from strategies that 
				serve to enhance relevant content so that activation of the relevant content is greater than 
				any inappropriate activation of irrelevant content. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Studies of poor comprehenders to validate the SBF have primarily been in highly 
				controlled laboratory studies
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(e.g. Gernsbacher, 1997;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="44">Gernsbacher et al., 1999)</span>. One 
				possibility not yet tested under the model is whether readers with limited background 
				knowledge and/or impaired planning or organization may struggle to lay adequate 
				foundations as they begin the reading process. In this case, the problem would not be 
				related to difficulty suppressing. Instead, an adequate foundational structure may never 
				be activated. Perhaps readers with these issues may benefit from strategies that ensure 
				adequate activation of a foundational structure prior to encountering text.

				<strong>Characteristics of adult readers with ABI.</strong> How does the reading 
				comprehension performance of adults with ABI fit with the SBF theoretical framework?
				Although specific cognitive processes are not addressed under the SBF, inefficient 
				suppression could be related to a number of cognitive problems such as inattention, 
				impaired working memory, and executive dysfunctions.

				The very limited research that has investigated reading comprehension and 
				cognition in adults with acquired brain injury does suggest a possible relationship 
				between cognitive impairments and reading comprehension performance
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Laatsch & Krisky, 2006;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="115">Schmitter-Edgecombe & Bales, 2005;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="113">Salmen, 2004;</span>
				<span class="cie-use" data-ref="0">Sullivan et al., in submission)</span>.
				A study by Schmitter-Edgecombe and Bales
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="115">(2005)</span> compared think-aloud 
				comments of readers with severe ABI to controls produced after reading each sentence of 
				a narrative. Compared to controls, readers with ABI were more likely to be restricted to 
				the content of the recently read sentence. These readers did not demonstrate integration of 
				ideas across the narrative compared to controls. Researchers hypothesized differences in 
				working memory contributed to the difference
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="115">(2005)</span>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				From the perspective of the SBF, these findings align with findings of other poor 
				comprehenders. Similar to other poor comprehenders, readers with ABI may also have 
				difficulty mapping, or integrating, incoming information onto activated structures. This 
				suggestion is corroborated by another study involving readers with ABI, <em>Strategies to 
				Improve Reading</em> (STIR)
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="119">(Sohlberg et al., 2011)</span>. The STIR study included a withinsubject
				comparison of adult readers with ABI (n=17) in two conditions: with reading 
				comprehension strategy prompts and without. Each participant read four 500-word 
				expository science passages on netbooks with two passages linked to the strategy 
				condition and two to the non-strategy condition. In the strategy condition, strategy 
				prompts were delivered at three different points in the reading process: before reading, 
				during reading, and after reading. Before reading, readers were presented with the four 
				main headings from the passage, then prompted to read each heading aloud. During 
				reading, readers were prompted to highlight key ideas. Highlighted ideas were saved into

				an outline form. After reading readers were presented with the outline of their highlights 
				and prompted to write a summary of their notes. Comprehension and retention of each 
				passage were evaluated using a sentence verification task (SVT) and a free recall task. 
			</p>

			<p>
				No significant differences were found on the dependent variables between the 
				strategy and the no-strategy conditions
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="119">(Sohlberg et al., 2011)</span>. However, a post-hoc 
				analysis revealed that readers were variable in their response to strategy prompts
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Griffiths & Sohlberg, 2012;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="119">Sohlberg et al., 2011)</span>. For the post-hoc analysis, the scores 
				on the no-strategy SVT were subtracted from the scores on the strategy condition SVT to 
				obtain a difference score for each participant. Difference scores were then sorted from 
				highest to lowest. Strategy usage of the five participants with the highest difference 
				scores—high responders—and the five participants with the lowest difference scores—
				low responders—were compared.  Of particular interest to this study was that the low 
				responders highlighted substantially more information than the high responders
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="119">(Sohlberg et al., 2011)</span>.
				This observation would be consistent with the idea in the SBF that the low 
				responders could not discern between relevant and irrelevant information so treated all 
				information as important. Furthermore, unlike high responders, low responders wrote 
				fewer or no summaries of their highlights when prompted to do so
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="119">(Sohlberg et al., 2011)</span>. 
				From the perspective of the SBF, summarizing information should facilitate the 
				integration or mapping of information onto foundational structures. Multiple factors may 
				be involved in why low responders did not write summaries

				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="14">(Brown, et al., 1993)</span>.  This finding and interpretation

			</p>

			<p>
				Further support for the suggestion that readers with TBI struggle with suppression
				during reading is provided by Laatsch and Krisky

				the neurological activity during reading comprehension of three adult subjects with a 
				history of severe TBI against matched controls using functional magnetic resonance

				the subjects with TBI was greater overall than the controls, and that more areas of the

				a problem with suppression, the finding does document differences in levels of activation

				based on the macrostructure—the overall theme and logical organization of the text. 
				Implicit details were based on the integration of two content units within the same

				Collectively the research on discourse-level processes in people with brain injury

				Intervention Options: Reading Comprehension Strategies
			</h2>

			<p>
				<strong>Current evidence for interventions.</strong> The research evaluating reading 
				comprehension intervention options for adults with cognitive impairments after ABI is 
				extremely limited. At the time of this writing, a literature search using databases from 
				multiple disciplines yields only two studies. The first study located was an unpublished 
				dissertation that examined the effects of an intervention conducted with adult college 
				students with traumatic brain injury enrolled in a remedial reading course
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="89">(Mann, 2006)</span>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The focus of the intervention was to train participants to use metacognitive 
				strategies, and progressed over four stages: (a) thinking before reading, (b) thinking 
				during reading, (c) thinking after reading, and (d) transfer
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="89">(Mann, 2006)</span>. Unfortunately, 
				little information was available regarding the intervention received by the control group. 
				This limited interpretation of analyses, but the study nonetheless provides helpful 
				descriptive information.
			</p>

			<p>
				All students with ABI (n=39) reported problems with concentration
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="89">(Mann, 2006)</span>.
				Sixty percent of participants with ABI had impaired visual convergence and were 
				referred for outside services. Progress between students with ABI was variable but 
				students consistently endorsed the usefulness of the strategies

				brain injury at two years of age and never learned to read
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Goddard & Rinderknecht, 2009)</span>.
				The intervention involved a multi-component intervention program to teach word

				Although the initial skill level and intervention targets of the case study are

				that individuals with ABI can continue to make gains in cognitive-linguistic functions 
				long after the onset of injury.

				<strong>Evidence for strategy effectiveness.</strong> Given the lack of evidence directly related 
				to reading comprehension interventions for adults with acquired brain injury, alternative 
				sources of empirical support were necessary to guide the development of an intervention 
				approach. Fortunately, evidence from the fields of cognitive rehabilitation and reading 
				education provided a basis for considering reading comprehension strategies as a 
				potential intervention approach. Reading comprehension strategies have been defined as:

				Gajria et al.
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="37">(2007)</span> reviewed research findings of interventions studies 
				specifically intended to target the ability of students with learning disabilities to 
				comprehend expository text. They reviewed 29 articles that met the following criteria: 
				published in English between 1978 to 2005; focused on interventions for comprehending 
				written expository text; included school-aged children or adolescents identified as 
				learning disabled; and used an experimental or quasi-experimental design that included at 
				least one measure of expository text comprehension. In total, the studies included 1,450 
				participants. Twenty-four of the articles focused on cognitive strategy instruction. 
				Strategies included teaching students to identify different types of text structures; to 
				identify the main idea of a passage; to summarize what was read; to generate and answer 
				questions about the text; or to develop cognitive maps of content. Effects sizes for each 
				study were calculated using the difference between the mean posttest score of the 
				intervention group divided by the pooled standard deviation
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Cohen’s <em>d</em>; Cohen, 1988)</span>. If 
				an article did not report means and standard deviations then effect sizes were calculated 
				using the <em>F</em> or <em>t</em>-test scores were provided. The meta-analysis of results indicated an 
				overall effect size for cognitive strategy instruction was 1.83 (SD = 1.05, <em>n</em> = 1.05, <em>n</em> =

				15).<span class="superscript">1</span> Within the different types of strategies reviewed, identifying the main idea or 
				generating main idea sentences by paraphrasing or summarizing were particularly 
				effective strategies (<em>d</em> = 2.56, SD=1.09, <em>n</em> = 6). Text strategy instruction was also highly 
				effective (<em>d</em> = 2.33, SD = 0.07, <em>n</em> = 2). Although effect sizes for cognitive mapping (<em>d</em> = 
				.96, SD = 0.07, <em>n</em>=2) and questioning were not as high (<em>d</em> = .91, SD = 0.62, <em>n</em> = 3), they 
				still were considered large. Gajria et al.’s meta-analysis provides support for the 
				effectiveness in teaching students with learning disabilities cognitive strategies to 
				improve reading comprehension of expository text
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="37">(2007)</span>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Berkeley et al.’s meta-analysis
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="9">(2010)</span> provides additional support. 
				Question/strategy interventions included main idea strategy instruction with selfmonitoring
				training; elaborative interrogation; guided identification of story themes; textstructure analysis;
				and peer-assisted learning strategies that included identification of 
				main idea, relevant information and summarization of content. Like Gajria et al.
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="37">(2007)</span>, 
				Berkeley et al also focused on students with learning disabilities (<em>n</em> = 1,734), although the 
				way learning disability was defined differed between the two. Gajria et al. did not include 
				studies of students with reading disabilities, however they did not exclude studies if 
				students had an additional disability besides learning. Berkeley et al. also did not limit 
				their review to expository text. Their review included 40 articles published during the 
				period of 1995 to 2006. Effect sizes for question/strategy instruction were moderate to 
				large, depending on whether criterion (<em>d</em> =.75, SD =.17, <em>n</em>= 22) or norm-referenced (<em>d</em> 
				=.48, SD = .29, <em>n</em> = 8) measures were considered.

				Although reported effect sizes between the two analyses vary, both ultimately 
				provide strong evidence to suggest the reading comprehension strategies may be effective 
				for improving reading comprehension performance of struggling readers with learning 
				disabilities. Evidence regarding metacognitive strategy training in cognitive rehabilitation 
				makes the approach particularly compelling for use with adults with acquired brain 
				injury. However, additional evidence was needed to help guide strategy selection.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Evidence to guide strategy selection.</strong> While some interventions have focused on 
				utilization of a single strategy, for example teaching students to identify and state the 
				main idea in their own words
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="30">(Ellis & Graves, 1990)</span>, increasing evidence supports the 
				use of multiple strategies
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="37">(Gajria et al., 2007)</span>. Eight of the articles reviewed in the Gajria 
				et al, study combined multiple strategies. For example, three studies combined a selfmonitoring
				strategy with another reading comprehension strategy, such as identifying the 
				main idea or summarizing the text
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="65">(Jitendra, Hoppes, & Xin, 2000;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Malone & Mastropieri, 1992)</span>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Others have focused on teaching students or patients to use different strategies at 
				different points in the reading process. The RRSG stressed that the, “reader, text, and 
				activity are interrelated in dynamic ways that vary across pre-reading, reading postreading” (pg. 12).
				Clinically, multi-component reading strategy routines are commonly 
				used to help readers recall different steps to complete at different points in the reading 
				process; for example, K-W-L

				The most well supported reading strategies tend to facilitate performance in the 
				following three areas: (1) anticipating content; (2) actively selecting and organizing 
				content while reading; and (3) synthesizing and integrating content. Several strategies
				from the first set are designed to activate background knowledge or to help readers 
				anticipate text content and structure before they begin their reading

				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Pressley et al., 1995)</span>.

			<h2>
				Development of Reading Comprehension Strategy Package 
			</h2>

			<p>
				Based on the available research, a reading comprehension strategy package (RS) 
				was developed for this study that electronically delivered reading strategies at three 
				different phases in the reading process: pre-reading, during reading, and post-reading . 
				Below, each phase is described along with strategy components implemented in that 
				phase. The design of the strategy package aligns with SBF, with the ultimate goal to help 
				readers develop a cohesive, coherent knowledge structure. The suggested theoretical 
				mechanism behind the strategies is that they support the participants’ ability to lay a 
				global foundation for understanding the text, facilitate detection and mapping of coherent 
				content through active manipulation and summarizing of the text, and reinforce 
				construction of local and global coherence. For this study, strategy supports and content 
				were delivered electronically. Electronic delivery allowed for consistent delivery of 
				supports and is also a medium commonly utilized in college settings. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Note that design of the reading comprehension strategy package and the 
				dependent variable measures used in the current study was adapted from the design 
				implemented for the STIR study, described earlier in the section on poor comprehenders 
			</p>

				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="119">(Sohlberg, Fickas, & Griffiths, 2011)</span>. Strategy instructions were modified for the 
				current study to ensure participants limited use of highlighting to key concepts, and 
				increased use of summarizing; instructions are described in more depth below. In 
				addition, reading materials selected for the current study were longer (approximately 
				2,700 words) than those used in the STIR study (approximately 500 words) to ultimately 
				help prevent ceiling effects, a problem in the STIR study thought to be associated with 
				the shorter passages.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Pre-reading phase strategy.</strong> The first phase of the package was the pre-reading 
				phase. The strategy in this phase guided readers through previewing the chapter content. 
				Readers were presented with a list of headings from a given chapter. Readers were 
				instructed to read each heading aloud and then to click on it. Clicking on it revealed the 
				sentence from the text that immediately followed that heading. Readers were instructed to 
				read along as this sentence was read aloud by the computer via text-to-speech. Readers 
				continued in this manner through all of the headings.
			</p>

			<p>
				The purpose of the first strategy was to facilitate the laying of an initial 
				foundation for text comprehension. The preview strategy capitalized on the <em>advantage of 
				first mention</em> by exposing readers to the overall organization and the scope of topics in 
				the chapter before they began reading
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="43">(Gernsbacher & Hargreaves, 1992)</span>. As such, 
				readers would already have some familiarity with the content when they encountered it in 
				the actual text. A logically organized foundation based on the global structure of the text 
				should support formation of a coherent line of thought.

			<p>
				<strong>Reading phase strategies.</strong> After the pre-reading phase, participants clicked to 
				advance to the reading phase. The reading phase displayed the full chapter in the left side 
				of the window. The chapter was divided into sections, with each heading demarcating the 
				beginning of a section. Throughout the reading process, a table of contents formed by the 
				headings remained within view on the right side of the screen. Participants could navigate 
				through the chapter by clicking on the headings in the table of contents, or by scrolling
				through the text as they read. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Participants were instructed to highlight one or two key ideas in each paragraph as 
				they read. They were further instructed to write at least one, but no more than two, notes 
				about what they just read. These highlights and notes were automatically copied into a 
				tool called <em>My Notebook</em>. As they reached the end of a section, participants were 
				prompted to open this notebook. They were instructed to read each of their highlights and 
				notes aloud, and to decide whether to retain or discard each by clicking on a checkmark 
				or an X. After reviewing their highlights and notes, they were then instructed to write a 
				three to five sentence summary of each section. After writing the summary, they returned 
				to reading the next section of the chapter. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The purposes of the strategies at this active reading phase were to enhance 
				processing and integration of relevant content to form a locally and globally coherent 
				understanding of the text. The user interface, navigation tools and guided sequence of 
				activities through the text all served to boost readers’ awareness of the global 
				organization of the text. To mitigate attention to irrelevant information, participants’ 
				usage of highlighting and note-taking tools while reading was constrained. Actively 
				annotating content while reading (e.g. highlighting with note taking), regularly reviewing

				and updating annotations were intended to help readers detect relevant and related 
				information needed to form a locally coherent understanding as information read. 
				Reviewing highlights and notes at the end of section was intended to facilitate detection 
				of coherence across the section; selecting or discarding highlights and notes helps update 
				understanding based on most relevant content. Iteratively summarizing information at the 
				end of each section reinforced development of a coherent understanding and facilitates 
				integration of that understanding with global structure before readers must shift to a new 
				section. 
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Review phase strategies.</strong> After reading all sections of the chapter, readers were 
				presented with the summaries they wrote for each section. They were instructed to read 
				each summary and then test their ability to recall each by “hiding it.” They were then 
				instructed to click on each hidden summary to reveal it again in order to evaluate how 
				well they did. They will continue to test themselves with each of the summaries they 
				wrote.
			</p>

			<p>
				The purposes of the strategies during the review phase were to facilitate further 
				integration of content and to reinforce a cohesive, coherent recollection of what they 
				read. The review strategy gave readers the opportunity to review condensed versions of 
				the entire chapter in order to facilitate connections between sections needed for a stronger 
				globally coherent representation of the chapter.
