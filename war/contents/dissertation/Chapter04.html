			<h1>
				RESULTS
			</h1>

			<p>
				This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a multi-component, theoretically 
				grounded reading comprehension strategy package (RS) on the reading comprehension 
				performance of individuals with a history of mild to moderate acquired brain injury. Research 
				questions sought to determine potential differences in performance in the strategy (RS) versus 
				no-strategy conditions (NS) on three measures: immediate free recalls, delayed free recalls, and 
				sentence verification tasks. This section presents the findings relative to the research questions 
				under the headings Immediate Free Recalls, Delayed Free Recalls, and Sentence Verification 
				Tasks. All analyses were conducted using SPSS 19.0.
			</p>

			<p class="noIndent">
				Immediate Free Recalls 
			</p>

			<p>
				Results from the immediate free recall tasks were analyzed by conducting within-subject 
				analysis of variance for each dependent measure: (1) total correct information units (total CIUs; 
				Appendix E), (2) efficiency of recall (CIUs/minute), (3), local cohesion (LSA, sentence to 
				sentence), and (4) global cohesion (LSA, paragraph to paragraph ). Alpha was adjusted to reduce 
				risk of Type I error given multiple tests (α =.05/4). Strategy condition was used as the 
				independent variable (RS, NS); strategy order (1<span class="superscript">st</span>
				, 2<span class="superscript">nd</span>) and chapter (A, B) were included as 
				additional fixed variables to account for order and chapter effects. Significant differences were 
				noted within subjects for the RS and NS conditions when comparing total correct information 
				units (F(1,26)=32.31, p=.001, η<span class="superscript">2</span>=.193). No significant differences were found with the 
				efficiency variable or the local and global cohesion variables.  Results of the analysis are 
				reported together with delayed free recall results in Table 5.

			<h2>
				Delayed Free Recalls 
			</h2>

			<p>
				Within-subject analysis of variance was also used to analyze the results of the delayed 
				recall free recall task for each original dependent variable as reported above (total CIUs, 
				CIUs/minute, LSAss, LSApp), with strategy condition as the independent variable, and with 
				strategy order and chapter order as additional fixed variables. Alpha was adjusted to reduce risk 
				of Type I error (α=.05/4). Significant differences were noted within subjects for the RS and NS 
				conditions when comparing total correct information units (F(1,26)=29.43, p=.001, η<span class="superscript">2</span>=.215), 
				and when comparing correct information units per minute (F(1,26)=8.12, p=.005, η<span class="superscript">2</span>=.234.) No 
				significant differences were found with the local and global cohesion variables.  Results of the 
				analysis are reported with the immediate free recall results in Table 5 below.

				As noted above, a significant difference in efficiency of recall was noted when comparing 
				conditions in the delayed free recall tasks, but was not noted when comparing the conditions in 
				the immediate free recall task.  To further investigate the possible factors that might contribute to 
				the differences in efficiency of recall between the immediate and delayed free recall tasks, a 
				preliminary post-hoc analysis was initiated to identify factors that might elucidate these 
				differences. One observation noted when initially reviewing videos is that participants seemed to 
				pause more in the strategy condition during the process of recalling. The objective of the post-

				hoc analysis was to compare the total number of pauses and the total pause time each participant 
				had during each of the free recall tasks. A pause was defined as five or more seconds of silence.
				Although the videotaped recordings for all participants will need to be reviewed to complete the

				Sentence Verification Tasks
			</h2>

			<p>
				Results of the sentence verification tasks were analyzed by conducting a MANOVA that 
				included the three different sentence types from the sentence verification task.  As with the 
				previous analyses, the independent variable was strategy condition; strategy order and chapter 
				were included as additional fixed variables to account for possible order and chapter effects. 
				Using Wilk’s test of multivariate significance, strategy condition was statistically related to the 
				weighted multivariate combination of DV measures, Λ= .414, F(3,15) =7.07, p=.003, η2 = .586. 
				Univariate ANOVAs on each of the three measures comprising the multivariate composite
				revealed participants scored better on the local cohesion statements and the global cohesion
