			<p>
				Adult survivors of acquired brain injury (ABI) often enroll in post-secondary or 
				professional education after their injuries in order to establish, resume, or change career 
				paths
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="2">(Ackerman, DiRamio, & Mitchell, 2009;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="70">Kennedy, Krause, & Turkstra, 2008;</span>
				Stewart-Scott & Douglas, 1998)</span>. An increasing number of these adults are facing 
				educational failure because they have problems with academic reading activities 
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="69">(Kennedy et al., 2008;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="86">MacLennan & MacLennan, 2008;</span>

			</p>

			<p>
				In an electronic survey about college students’ experiences after traumatic brain 
				injury, 83% of the respondents reported having difficulty with academics since their 
				injuries (Kennedy et al., 2008). In particular, these individuals struggle with skills needed 
				for reading comprehension
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="69">(Kennedy et al., 2008;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="115">Schmitter-Edgecombe & Bales 2005;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="">Sullivan, Griffiths, Sohlberg & Fickas, submitted)</span>. Thirty-four out of the thirty-five 
				respondents in the Kennedy and colleagues survey cited needing to review material more 
				than they needed to prior to their injuries
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="69">(2008)</span>. More than half indicated being 
				overwhelmed or having difficulty paying attention when studying, and not understanding 
				assignments
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="69">(Kennedy et al., 2008)</span>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The problem is further compounded by the fact that the incidence of both 
				traumatic and non-traumatic acquired brain injuries in young and middle-aged adults is 
				growing
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="32">(Faul, Xu, Wald, & Coronado, 2010;</span>

				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="46">Coronado, 2011)</span>. Multiple factors are contributing to this growth, including recreation 
				and sports concussions, combat-related injuries, rising rates of stroke and meningitis in 
				young adults, as well as improved survival rates overall from acquired neurological 
				issues
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Adler, Possemato, Mavandadi et al., 2011;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="38">George, Tong, Kuklina, & Labarthe, 2011;</span>

				Responding to the needs of this population requires overcoming several barriers 
				in the knowledge base. A primary barrier is the lack of consensus about the processes 
				involved in reading comprehension for proficient readers
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="92">(McNamara & Magliano, 2009; RAND Reading Study Group, 2002; Sadoski & Paivio, 2007)</span>.
				The RAND Reading Study 
				Group
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="106">(RRSG, 2002)</span>, comprised of fourteen reading experts representing a range of 
				disciplines and research methodologies, convened to develop a reading research agenda 
				that would ultimately lead to effective methods to improve reading comprehension of 
				students. The group determined that despite a large body of research on the process of 
				reading comprehension, “those research efforts have been neither systematic nor 
				interconnected,” and as such, was  “insufficient in providing a basis to redesign reading 
				comprehension instruction”
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="106">(2002; pg 2)</span>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				To help facilitate an organized, more cohesive, and practical approach to reading 
				comprehension research, the RRSG offered a characterization of reading comprehension 
				that builds on the “sizeable but sketchy” knowledge base to remind researchers about the 
				multiple factors that must be considered. They first defined reading comprehension “as 
				the process of simultaneously extracting and constructing meaning through interaction 
				and involvement with written language”
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="106">(RRSG, 2002, pg. 11)</span>. The group emphasized

				that researchers must consider the dynamic interaction between three elements: the 
				reading activity, the text, and the reader—all of which takes place within a larger 
				sociocultural process. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Another limitation in the knowledge base is the lack of understanding of how 
				cognitive impairments in adults with ABI contributes to difficulties with reading 
				comprehension impairments
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="80">(Lezak, 1995;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="81">Lezak, Howieson, & Loring, 2012;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="84">Lundberg, 1991;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="">Sohlberg & Turkstra, 2011)</span>. The profiles of impairments within the population of 
				adults with ABI are diverse
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="80">(Lezak, 1995;
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Sohlberg & Mateer, 2001;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="119">Sohlberg & Turkstra, 2011)</span>. Many adults with ABI report that they can read for most purposes, but 
				struggle with more complex reading activities such as reading to learn
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="53">(Griffiths, Sohlberg, Samples, Dixon, & Close, 2010;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="81">Lezak, 2012;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="113">Salmen, 2004;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="122">Sohlberg & Turkstra, 2011)</span>. This current study focused on adults who experience these reading 
				comprehension problems in the absence of clinically significant language impairments 
				such as aphasia or frank visuospatial deficits.
			</p>

			<p>
				Cognitive impairments, the hallmark sequelae after acquired brain injuries, have 
				the potential to impact reading comprehension
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="80">(Lezak, 1995;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="115">Schmitter-Edgecombe, & Bales, 2005;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="122">Sohlberg & Turkstra, 2011)</span>. Understanding the cognitive underpinnings in 
				the proficient reader, and how impairments in these processes can affect the reading 
				comprehension process, is important for helping readers with acquired brain injuries 
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="115">(Schmitter-Edgecombe, & Bales, 2005;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="122">Sohlberg & Turkstra, 2011)</span>. Common cognitive 
				impairments in the ABI population include deficits in focused and controlled attention, 
				working memory, verbal learning and recall, and executive processing functions, all of

				Understanding the relevant cognitive processes in proficient readers, and how 
				impairments in these processes can affect reading comprehension, requires utilizing 
				reliable and valid assessment tools. These tools must represent the complexity of the 
				reading comprehension process
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Fletcher 2006;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Pearson & Hamm, 2005;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Sweet, 2005)</span>. 
				Ideally, these tools will differentially measure processes that contribute to reading 
				comprehension, such as different cognitive functions, word recognition abilities, and 
				background knowledge

				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Pearson & Hamm, 2005;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Sweet, 2005)</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Unfortunately, another barrier facing reading research and intervention is the 
				paucity of validated reading comprehension tools
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Pearson & Hamm, 2005;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="106">RRSG, 2002;</span>
				Sweet, 2005)</span>. Tests designed specifically for reading assessment of adult neurological 
				population, such as the <em>Reading Comprehension Battery for Aphasia</em>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="76">(RCBA; LaPointe & Horner, 1998)</span> focus only on the contribution of linguistic impairments to reading, and do 
				not evaluate comprehension beyond four paragraphs. Other tests of reading 
				comprehension available for adult populations such as the <em>Nelson Denny Test of Reading</em>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="14">(Brown, Fischo, & Hanna, 1993)</span> only serve the purpose of predicting academic 
				performance, not pinpointing breakdowns in the reading comprehension process 
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="99">(Morsey, Kieffer, & Snow, 2010)</span>. Measures grounded on theoretical models of reading 
				comprehension could help identify specific breakdowns in the reading comprehension 
				process. Such information is necessary for understanding similarities and differences

				Given the aforementioned barriers—the gaps in knowledge about the reading 
				comprehension process in proficient readers, the even sparser evidence about the 
				cognitive underpinnings for reading comprehension, and the challenge of assessing 
				proficient and impaired reading comprehension—the lack of research specifically 
				evaluating reading comprehension interventions designed for adults with ABI is not 
				surprising. In the absence of direct evidence, the foundation for developing reading 
				comprehension interventions can start with evidence from studies that compare reading 
				behaviors of proficient readers and poor readers
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="50">(Graesser, McNamara, & Louwerse, 2003;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="103">Paris, & Myers, 1981;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="104">Perfetti, 1985)</span>. Proficient readers typically approach 
				reading-to-learn strategically to organize, evaluate and retain information throughout the 
				reading comprehension process; poor readers in comparison often do not demonstrate 
				evidence of strategy use when reading-to-learn

				The purpose of this study was to examine whether the use of a reading 
				comprehension strategy package improved the reading comprehension performance of 
				adults with ABI. The study focused on expository texts, a type of text used across all 
				disciplines for academic learning and therefore critical to the target population attempting 
				to return to school or training
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="78">(Biancarosa & Snow, 2004;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="125">Lee & Spratley, 2010;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="106">RRSG, 2002)</span>. The development of the reading comprehension strategy package for this study 
				was based on current reading comprehension theory and current research characterizing 
				cognitive impairments in the ABI population. To evaluate the effect of strategy use,
				adults with ABI read expository text in two conditions: with reading comprehension 
				strategies (RS) and without (NS).
				A within-subject design was conducted using free 
				verbal recall and sentence verification tasks to evaluate reading comprehension 
				performance in each condition.

				The next chapter begins by providing a comprehensive characterization of the 
				population of adults with acquired brain injuries at risk for reading comprehension 
				problems. This is followed by a description of reading comprehension theory relevant to

				guiding the development of reading comprehension intervention. Next, research findings 
				are reviewed from cognitive rehabilitation and special education literature to inform the

				In Chapter III, the methods for the research study are detailed. This chapter begins 
				with an account of the preliminary process completed to select, develop and validate

				IV presents the study data and the results of statistical analyses. The final chapter 
				provides an interpretation of the results, and discussion of the implications of the findings 
				for assisting adults with reading comprehension deficits following acquired brain injury.
