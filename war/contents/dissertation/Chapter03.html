			<h1>
				METHODS
			</h1>

			<h2>
				Experimental Design
			</h2>

			<p>
				Twenty-four adults with a history of acquired brain injury (ABI) were recruited to 
				participate in a within subject group comparison. Participants read two different expository 
				chapters drawn from an introductory college textbook on world prehistory and archeology 
				(Chazan, 2011) under two different conditions: (a) the experimental or reading strategy (RS)
				package condition, and (b) the control or no-strategy (NS) package condition. Two types of 
				measures were used to assess reading comprehension performance: free recall tasks (immediate 
				and delayed), and a sentence verification task.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Research Procedures
			</h2>

			<p>
				<strong>Recruitment.</strong> Students currently or previously enrolled in Coastline Community 
				College’s (CCC) Acquired Brain Injury program were invited to participate in the study. The 
				program facilitates return to college and work for adults recovering from ABI. Students attend 
				three courses delivered concurrently over one academic year: a psychosocial adjustment course, 
				a cognitive retraining course and a computer skills course. All participants enrolled in the study 
				were prescreened by faculty at CCC to ensure they met the inclusion and exclusion criteria as 
				described below. One enrolled participant met criteria at the time of enrollment, but began an 
				outpatient program for depression partway through the study; she was paid for her participation 
				but ultimately did not complete the study. See Tables 1 and 2 for a summary of demographic 
				characteristics.

				<strong>Research sessions.</strong> Participants completed a total of six research sessions:  Three 
				sessions were completed as part of condition one, and three were completed as part of condition 
				two (See Figure 1).  Each condition consisted of one two-hour session, one ninety-minute
				sessions, and one thirty-minute session.  All sessions were completed in classrooms at the CCC
				ABI program campus.  
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong><em>Sessions one and four: Condition orientation and skills assessment.</em></strong> The initial sessions 
				for each condition (i.e., sessions one and four) had two purposes: (1) administrations of a battery 
				of language, cognitive, and reading assessments, and (2) orientation to the user interfaces
				developed for each particular condition.  The assessment battery was completed as a part of a 
				separate study designed to profile cognitive, language and reading abilities of college students

				with ABI who complain of reading comprehension problems. The battery included measures of 
				attention, executive processing, speed of processing, verbal learning and recall, and working 
				memory capacity, as well as standardized reading comprehension tests and a reading behaviors 
				survey. Note results will be reported in a separate paper.
			</p>

			<p>
				The condition orientations were completed to ensure participants were competent 
				navigating the user interface designed for each particular condition. As described in Chapter II, 
				“Development of Reading Strategy Package,” content was delivered electronically. In the RS 
				condition, strategy instructions and supports were integrated into the reading interface . 
				Otherwise, user interfaces for both conditions were similar, with text presented within a 
				scrollable window on a 32-inch computer screen, using identical fonts and similar navigation 
				features. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Orientations were conducted in small groups in a classroom with each participant seated 
				in front of a computer screen. The researcher controlled the display of individual screens from a 
				computer at the front of the room, and would toggle control of the display to allow participants to 
				complete guided practice steps. The researcher followed a script generated for orientations that 
				followed a model, lead, and test format based on principles of systematic instruction
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Sohlberg, & Mateer, 2001)</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				For both conditions, participants were trained to typical digital reading tools found in 
				PDF readers and web, such as scroll bars, clickable buttons, and click-and-drag text selection.
				In the experimental condition, participants were also trained to follow the instruction steps 
				displayed as part of of each reading comprehension strategy. This aspect of the training included 
				a brief description of the rationale and purpose for the strategy, demonstration of the expected

				actions to be taken, and guided practice.  After instruction of the features of the user interface, 
				the researcher tested each participant individually with a competency checklist to ensure he or 
				she used program features and followed displayed instructions accurately. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Once participants passed the test for using the program, they were instructed to continue 
				to use the program for a total of forty minutes. Reading material for the orientations was drawn 
				from a book already familiar to the cohort from the Coastline program, with selected content 
				counterbalanced across training conditions. Hence participants had the opportunity to learn and 
				practice using an upcoming condition’s program with familiar content before actually using it 
				with the study content.
			</p>

			<p>
				Partway through the practice time using the interface for each condition, the researcher 
				took each participant separately to a nearby private, quiet area to administer individual tests from 
				the battery. After completing the individually administered tests, each participant returned to the 
				group area to resume practice time. See Appendix A for a full list of the tests. 
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong><em>Sessions two, three, five and six: Reading and study sessions.</em></strong> Participants completed the 
				experimental and control conditions in the remaining four sessions. Each condition occurred over 
				two consecutive sessions: two and three, and then five and six, and were scheduled within a 
				week of the condition orientation. The order of presentation of conditions was counterbalanced 
				across participants. Half of the participants completed the control condition in sessions two and 
				three, and the experimental condition in sessions five and six. The other half of participants 
				completed the experimental condition in sessions two and three and the control condition in 
				sessions five and six. See Figure 1 for session schedules.

			<p>
				Participants focused on reading one chapter in each condition. Two chapters, A and B, 
				were drawn from <em>World Prehistory and Archeology</em>, an introductory college anthropology 
				textbook described in more detail in the Materials section below
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="21">(Chazan, 2011)</span>.
				Order of presentation of chapters was counterbalanced, with half of participants reading Chapter A first, 
				and half reading Chapter B first. Pairing of chapters with conditions was also counterbalanced 
				across participants. Half of the participants read Chapter A in the control condition and Chapter 
				B in the experimental condition; the other half read Chapter A in the experimental condition and 
				Chapter B in the control condition.  Counterbalancing was used to control for order of condition 
				effects, order of chapter effects, and chapter content effect. The counterbalancing resulted in four 
				different permutations, which was repeated eight times. See Table 3 for an example of the 
				counterbalancing.

				Participants were then told that they would continue to read on the computer but would 
				read a chapter they had never read before that was drawn from an introductory college textbook 
				on archeology. They were advised they would have sixty minutes to read and study the chapter, 
				and that afterwards they would be asked by the researcher, “tell me everything that you learned 
				from the chapter you just read.” The researcher remained in the room throughout both

				<strong><em>Free recall tasks.</em></strong> Immediately following the reading task, participants completed the
				first free recall task. Free recalls were elicited using three prompts, that were given 
				consecutively: (1) “tell me everything that you learned from the chapter that you read,” (2) 
				“thinking about the chapter you read, tell me what you think are three of the biggest ideas,” (3) 
				“tell me what you think the main purpose of the chapter was.”
			</p>

			<p>
				The researcher maintained an attentive but neutral expression and allowed the participant
				to continue talking until they paused for more than 15 seconds or gave a concluding statement 
				(e.g. “that’s it”).  Then the researcher would say, “Take some time to think to see if you 
				remember anything else.” Responses after each prompt were considered complete when the 
				participant either ended any additional content with a concluding remark, or paused for more

				<strong><em>Sentence verification task.</em></strong> After the free recall task, participants were instructed they

				information from the chapter they just read. Three types of sentences were presented, with ten of 
				each type: paraphrases, local cohesion inferences and global cohesion inferences. Development 
				and validation of the sentence verification task (SVT) is described in the Methods section below

				<strong>Selection of reading content.</strong> Expository texts are used across all disciplines for 
				academic learning
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="">(Biancarosa et al, 2004;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="78">Lee & Spratley, 2010;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="106">RRSG, 2002)</span>.
				Despite their 
				common use, selecting and/or developing expository texts for reading comprehension assessment 
				introduces challenges not encountered with narrative texts. As indicated earlier, narratives share 
				a predictable organizational pattern, or <em>story grammar</em>; for example, narratives typically involve 
				characters in a setting, who through some event are faced with a problem or a challenge 
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="88">(Mandler, & Goodman, 1982)</span>. Expository text structures are
				more variable and do not follow a 
				consistent structural outline
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Biber, 1985;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Mosenthal, 1989)</span>.
				A number of factors can influence 
				the structure of expository text, including discipline-specific conventions, the assumed level of 
				background knowledge of the reader, as well as the skills, abilities and background knowledge of 
				the writer
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Biber, 1985;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="78">Lee & Spratley, 2010)</span>. All of these factors can influence 
				comprehension; hence, if a comparison is to be made between the RS and NS conditions, these 
				factors must be controlled.
			</p>

			<p>
				The selection of text for this study focused on the social sciences and humanities to limit 
				discipline-specific procedural content that require cognitive skills beyond reading, such as 
				mathematical formulas or computer programming steps. Given that discipline-specific 
				conventions and background knowledge requirements increase as course level advances, an 
				introductory level textbook was chosen. Introductory social science and humanities texts tend to 
				share similar structural patterns that can be categorized using broad-based expository text 
				typology schemes, such as description, sequence, comparison, cause-effect, and problem solution 
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Mosenthal, 1985)</span>
				and persuade, transfer information, entertain/edify, and reveal self
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Biber, 1989)</span>. To help control for the effects of writing style and text format, chapter selection was made

				from one textbook written by the same author. The selected textbook also needed to present 
				chapters in a somewhat modular manner; that is, chapters needed to be able to be understood 
				independently of the rest of the content from the textbook.  Finally, selected text needed to be
				ecologically valid. Criteria used to evaluate ecological validity included: currently in publication 
				in paper form, currently used in introductory college courses, and typical textbook layout in 
				terms of organization and use of pedagogical devices. Potential textbooks were reviewed by at 
				least three members of the research team with final selection made in a team meeting.
			</p>

			<p>
				The selected textbook was <em>World Prehistory and Archeology</em>, written by Dr. Michael 
				Chazan, a practicing anthropologist who teaches at the University of Toronto. See Appendix B 
				for copies of the chapters. The book, currently published in its second edition by Pearson 
				Publishing
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="21">(2011)</span>,
				is used in the University of Oregon’s introductory anthropology course. The 
				book is divided into four sections: (1) “the past is a foreign country,” (2) “human evolution,” (3) 
				“perspectives on agriculture,” and (4) “the development of social complexity.” Each section 
				begins with a four to five page overview of the section, and contains between two and five 
				chapters. Including the sections, appendices, glossary, references and index, the book is 445 
				pages long; pedagogical devices include bolded vocabulary terms; sidebar content to reinforce or 
				extend content such as pictures and figures, and end of chapter questions. Considerations for text
				selection included that the two selections be equivalent in terms of level of difficulty and overall 
				text structure, and that they contain approximately 3,000 words to allow participants to finish 
				reading and studying the chapters within 60 minutes. 
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Evaluation of selected text.</strong> When potential text selections that met criteria were 
				identified, a number of discourse analysis procedures were utilized to compare content within the 
				chapters to ensure equivalency in length, complexity, and general organization. Passage

				mapping, a process for identifying important information and the relations among them, was
				conducted by the researcher and a research assistant following procedures outlined by National 
				Assessment of Educational Progress
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(NAEP, 2009; Section C1)</span>.
				The maps reflect the relations 
				among three levels of ideas: central, major, and supporting; classify dominant organizational 
				patterns, such as description, cause/effect, or problem/solution; identify text features, such as 
				headings and figures; and describe aspects of writing style used to convey ideas. For the purpose 
				of evaluating text equivalency, section headings within each selected chapter were considered 
				organizing elements, and then each evaluator determined the dominant organizational patterns of 
				each section. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Inter-rater reliability was calculated by comparing the proportion of agreement for 
				dominant organizational patterns identified for each section of both chapters, and was 92.6%. For 
				the purposes of assessing chapter equivalency, the chapters needed to be similar in their 
				dominant organizational patterns. By far the overall dominant organizational patterns for both 
				chapters were description and comparison, with 100% inter-rater agreement on these aspects. 
				Minor differences were noted regarding dominant organizational patterns within portions of 
				certain sections; for example, one rater identified a pattern as cause/effect that the other 
				identified a problem/solution pattern.  Chapter A was modified to improve equivalency by 
				deleting selected paragraphs and adding a heading. See Appendix B for the chapters, and 
				Appendix C for a sample passage map. 
			</p>

			<p>
				To further evaluate chapter equivalency, content was further evaluated using Coh-Metrix
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="93">(McNamara, Louwerse, Cai, & Graesser, 2005)</span>
				an automated text analyzer that computes over 
				50 text metrics. These metrics describe different semantic and syntactic aspects of the text,

				in Chapter II, the RS condition divided the reading process into three phases: pre-reading, 
				reading, and review. In the pre-reading phase, readers were guided to preview the text through 
				presentation of chapter headings and initial sentences of each section. In the reading phase, 
				participants were asked to highlight information and take notes as they read each section, then 
				summarize each section before continuing to the next. In the review section, readers were 
				presented with their section summaries, asked to read each one aloud, “hide” them by clicking on 
				them, then tested themselves by trying to recall each one. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In the control condition, readers read text presented within a standard PDF reader 
				window. They were instructed to read the chapter, using the scroll bar or tools to navigate the 
				chapter. As indicated above, they were provided with access to a word processing program in an 
				adjacent tab to the program and advised they were free to take notes as they read. 
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Fidelity of condition implementation.</strong> Session instructions for both conditions were 
				developed by the researcher and the research advisor to insure consistency of implementation. 
				Two of eight group-training sessions were videotaped; the researcher and the research advisor 
				discussed the sessions to insure fidelity to developed scripts. Both reading conditions for each 
				individual were also videotaped.  Researcher/researcher assistant instructions given during 
				individual sessions were transcribed by an offsite research assistant; the researcher reviewed 
				20% of transcripts to ensure fidelity using a checklist to compare stated with planned instructions
				with 100% fidelity observed.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Dependent Variables
			</h2>

			<p>
				As described in Chapter I, a barrier facing reading research and intervention is the 
				paucity of validated reading comprehension assessment tools

				No standardized, or otherwise validated reading comprehension measures 
				exist for use with adults with acquired brain injuries that target that target comprehension of 
				expository text. Given the absence of standardized and validated measures, measures were 
				developed based on procedures drawn from the experimental literature. Reading comprehension 
				performance was also measured in multiple ways to increase reliability of findings through 
				corroboration. Two types of assessment tasks were ultimately administered to measure reading 
				comprehension performance: free recall tasks, and a sentence verification task, described below.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Free recall tasks.</strong> Participants completed two free recall tasks: one immediately after 
				reading the chapter, and one the following day. Eliciting and analyzing verbal discourse 
				produced during or after individuals read written text is increasingly used to assess reading 
				comprehension
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Gillam, Fargo, & Robertson, 2009;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Laundauer, McNamara, Dennis, & Kintsch, 2007;</span>

				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Millis, agliano, & Todaro, 2006;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Wolfe & Goldman, 2005)</span>.
				As described in Chapter II, eliciting and analyzing 
				verbal discourse has also been used to assess listening comprehension in adults with acquired 
				brain injury
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Coelho, 2002, 2007;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="24">Coelho, Liles, & Duffy, 1991)</span>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Methods to elicit and analyze discourse samples after the assessment process vary 
				substantially depending on the purpose of the assessment, the nature of the original text, and the 
				type of prompt used to elicit the sample
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Coelho, 2002)</span>.
				Despite the variation, methods typically 
				involve asking participants to read, or listen/watch a video of a short story or expository topic. 
				Discourse samples typically fall into two categories: <em>think-aloud</em> productions, elicited during the 
				comprehension process, and <em>free-recall</em> productions, elicited after the comprehension process.
				Because elicitation of discourse during the comprehension process alters the comprehension 
				process, it was not appropriate for the purposes of this study.  
			</p>

			<div class="pagebreak">

				</span>
			</div>

<!-- Page 54 -->

			<p>
				Discourse samples are then transcribed and analyzed to identify patterns that reflect the 
				construct under study. For this study, a benefit from using the strategies should be reflected in 
				participant’s ability to recall more correct information with better efficiency. Theoretically, a 
				more coherent mental structure should facilitate better understanding and retention of more 
				information as the structure allows information to be grouped; this improvement should be 
				reflected in an increase in the quantity of correct information units. A more coherent mental 
				structure should also bolster organization of content, and better organization of content should 
				facilitate better efficiency and cohesiveness of recall. Based on the aspects of the free recalls 
				that were hypothesized to improve, the following four dependent variables were selected as 
				measures to extract from the discourse samples:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					Quantity of recall: Total correct information units (CIUs)
				</li>

				<li>
					Efficiency of recall: Correct information units per minute (CIUs/min)
				</li>

				<li>
					Local cohesion: Sentence to sentence LSA (LSA<span class="subscript">ss</span>)
				</li>

				<li>
					Global cohesion: Paragraph to paragraph LSA (LSA<span class="subscript">pp</span>)
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				The first two measures were calculated via manual coding procedures described by 
				Nicholas and Brookshire
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="100">(1993)</span>,
				and the last two were calculated via an automated text analyzer, 
				following procedures of Laundauer, McNamara, Dennis, and Kintsch
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Coh-Metrix, 2007)</span>.
				Manual coding included counting the total number of <em>correct information units</em> (CIUs) produced, 
				and noting the total time the participant spent retelling (CIUs/minute).  CIUs are defined as 
				words that are intelligible in context, and are accurate and relevant in relation to the topic. Words 
				do not have to be used in a grammatically correct manner.  See Appendix E for the manual 
				coding procedures used.

			<p>
				Cohesiveness contributes to the coherence of discourse, and as such, cohesiveness is 
				often used as a proximal measure of coherence
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Laundauer et al., 2007)</span>.
				Latent semantic analysis
				was used to obtain measures of discourse cohesion
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="93">(McNamara et al., 2005)</span>.
				Cohesiveness was 
				evaluated at two levels: locally, using sentence-to-sentence latent semantic analysis, and
				globally, using paragraph-to-paragraph latent semantic analysis. 
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong><em>Fidelity of scoring.</em></strong> The primary researcher and two research assistants transcribed 
				discourse samples. The primary researcher supervised the transcription process, and watched
				100% of the video samples to insure reliability of transcriptions. Manual coding was conducted 
				independently for 50% of the transcripts by the primary researcher and a Master’s level research 
				assistant, with results then compared. Inter-rater reliability of accuracy was calculated using 
				Cohen’s Kappa with a criterion level of .90
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Stevens, 2009)</span>.
				To resolve discrepancies in counts 
				or accuracy of categorization, a third research assistant was consulted to make a final judgment. 
				The researcher ensured all transcripts were pre-processed according to instructions provided by 
				<em>Coh-Metrix</em>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="93">(McNamara et al., 2005)</span>. A research assistant
				then submitted the transcripts through 
				<em>Coh-Metrix</em>. Analyzed samples resulted in permanent records of results. 
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong><em>Reliability.</em></strong> Reliability of immediate and delayed free recall results were measured by 
				calculating Pearson’s product moment correlation for each chapter’s total scores for dependent 
				variables. Results were significant for all dependent variables (CIUs: <em>r</em> =.582, <em>p</em>=.001; 
				CIUs/minute: <em>r</em>=.671, <em>p</em>=.012;
				LSA<span class="subscript">ss</span>: <em>r</em>=.81, <em>p</em>=.0001;
				LSA<span class="subscript">pp</span>: <em>r</em>=.74, <em>p</em>=.005) .

				<strong>Sentence verification task.</strong>"The sentence verification task (SVT) is a widely used 
				paradigm in reading research
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="">(Pearson & Hamm, 2005; Royer, 1987)</span>.
				Sentence verification tasks
				(SVTs) involve having participants read a series of sentences and then making a binary decision

				about them (e.g. true/false). SVTs are typically devised to distinguish between different levels of 
				comprehension. For this study, three item types were generated: paraphrase, local coherence 
				inferences, and global cohesion inferences. The primary researcher and two research developed 
				sentence verification items assistants following procedures adapted from Royer and colleagues 
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Royer, 1987;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Royer & Cunningham, 1981)</span>. 
				A pilot study was conducted prior to using the 
				measure in this study to evaluate the reliability and validity of the SVTs. Forty-two volunteers 
				from an undergraduate course in Communication Disorders and Sciences participated in the pilot 
				study. Results indicated a significant correlation between total scores from the Chapter A items, 
				and the Chapter B (Pearson’s <em>r</em>= .816, <em>p</em> < .05). See Appendix D for a detailed description of 
				the development of the SVT and the pilot study given prior to using the measure in this study. 
			</p>

			<p>
				<em><strong>Fidelity of scoring.</strong></em> The SVT test was delivered via a survey software program, which 
				allowed participants’ responses to be recorded and totals calculated. Item scores were verified 
				by hand-scoring each response, with 100% overlap between computer and hand-scored results. 
			</p>

			<p>
				<em><strong>Reliability.</strong></em> Reliability of SVT results was evaluated using two measures. Cronbach’s 
				alpha was used to measure the internal consistency of items within each sentence type. Internal 
				consistency is a necessary requirement in order to interpret any differences between scores of the 
				three sentence types; if internal consistency is inadequate than differences are more likely to be 
				due to random error than to underlying constructs of the sentence types. An alpha result between 
				.70 and .80 is considered adequate internal consistency, between .80 and .90 good, and above .90 
				is very good
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Cronbach, 1975)</span>.
				Paraphrase items were judged borderline between adequate and 
				good (α =.789). Local items and global items were judged to be good (α =.854, α =.862). 
				Pearson’s product moment correlation was used to measure the consistency between total scores
				for Chapters A and B; if total scores are not statistically correlated, then differences in study
