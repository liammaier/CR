			<h1>
				DISCUSSION
			</h1>

			<p>
				The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether using a multi-component, reading 
				comprehension strategy package (RS) improves reading comprehension performance of 
				individuals with a history of mild to moderate acquired brain injury. This study is the first 
				experimental evaluation to demonstrate that adult college students with acquired brain injury 
				benefit from using reading comprehension strategies to improve performance on reading 
				comprehension measures. This study also identified research methods effective for evaluating 
				reading comprehension of expository text in adults with ABI.
			</p>

			<p>
				Grounded in the structure building framework (SFB), the hypothesis of this study was 
				that the reading comprehension strategy package would support readers to build a coherent 
				mental representation, or structure, of what they read. In turn, a coherent structure would 
				facilitate better performance on the reading comprehension measures administered after
				participants read the academic text. Two types of measures were used: free recall tasks given at 
				two points in time—immediately after reading each chapter and then again the following day, 
				and sentence verification tasks given after the delayed recall task in each condition. The findings 
				from the two free recall tasks are discussed first, followed by a discussion of the findings from 
				the sentence verification tasks. This section then reviews the limitations of this study, and 
				considers implications for future research. 
			</p>

			<h2>
				Effects of Strategy Use on Quantity, Efficiency and Coherence of Recall 
			</h2>

			<p>
				Research Questions 1 and 2 asked whether readers with ABI would comprehend better 
				when provided with the reading strategies compared to no strategies as measured by the quantity,

				efficiency, and cohesiveness of immediate and delayed free recall of chapter content. Readers 
				recalled more information when provided with the reading comprehension strategies. In both the 
				immediate and delayed free recall tasks, participants produced more correct information units
				(CIUs) in the RS condition than the NS condition. In the RS condition of the immediate free 
				recall task, participants produced on average 11.34 more CIUs; the effect of the strategies 
				accounted for 19.3% of the variance in total number of CIUs produced. In the RS condition of 
				the delayed free recall task, participants produced on average 23.68 more CIUs, with the effect of 
				the strategies accounting for 21.5% of the variance. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Although readers recalled on average 1.8 more correct information units per minute in the 
				RS condition of the immediate free recall as compared to the NS condition, this difference was 
				not significant. However, efficiency of recall was significantly different between conditions in 
				the delayed free recall condition; readers recalled on average 11.94 correct information units per 
				minute in the RS condition, with strategies accounting for 23.4% of the variance. That is, after a 
				24-hour delay, readers produced more information in less overall time if they had been provided 
				with reading comprehension strategies during the reading session. No significant differences 
				were noted in the free recall variables used as measures of local and global cohesion for either 
				the immediate or delayed conditions.  
			</p>

			<p>
				Overall the results provide partial support for hypotheses 1 and 2. The increased CIUs in 
				both the immediate and delayed recall strategy condition confirmed that quantity of information 
				recalled is enhanced by the multi-component strategy package. Readers’ efficiency of recall, 
				however, was only better in the strategy condition for the delayed free recall; no apparent 
				improvement in efficiency was suggested when comparing the conditions in the immediate free 
				recall.  A few possibilities might account for these discrepancies in results: (1) perhaps the

				reading comprehension strategy package facilitated improvement across some, but not all aspects 
				of reading comprehension, (2) perhaps some measures were not sensitive to the differences in 
				performance in the RS and NS conditions, (3) perhaps research design issues, such as a low 
				number of participants, or other sources of random error, limited detection of differences. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The reading comprehension strategy package was designed because of theoretical support
				suggesting reading comprehension strategies improve participants’ abilities to form a coherent 
				mental structural of the text.  As previously discussed in Chapter II, identifying measures that 
				reliability reflects improvements in mental structures is challenging. Theoretically, a more 
				coherent mental structure should facilitate better understanding and retention of more 
				information as the structure allows information to be grouped; this improvement should be 
				reflected in an increase in the quantity of correct information units. The results support this 
				theoretical rationale.
			</p>

			<p>
				A more coherent mental structure should also bolster organization of content, and better 
				organization of content should facilitate better efficiency of recall. The results from the RS
				condition of the delayed free recall task partially support this theory. The preliminary, post-hoc 
				exploration of three participants presented in Table 6 might help elucidate why efficiency did not 
				seem to improve in the immediate free recall task. The pattern of differences suggested by these 
				three participants showed that they paused more often and for a longer periods of time in the 
				immediate free recall of the RS condition as compared to the NS condition. A similar pattern is 
				noted when comparing the two delayed free recalls; however, when compared to their immediate 
				free recalls, pauses were not as frequent or for as long in the delayed recall. Although all 
				participants free recalls need to be reviewed and analyzed to determine is this pattern represents 
				a significant difference, a few possibilities are suggested from the reading and cognitive

				rehabilitation literature. From the perspective of the SBF, a framework was constructed during 
				the reading process, and as such, a more stable mental representation is available after reading 
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="44">(Gernsbacher, 1999)</span>.
				The difference in pause behavior in the immediate free recalls may be that 
				access to a stable mental representation in the RS condition supports longer contemplation of 
				what was learned. At least for immediate recall, longer contemplation time as suggested by 
				increased pauses may be a better reflection of effect of reading comprehension strategies than 
				improved efficiency of recall.
			</p>

			<p>
				An improvement in efficiency in the delayed free recall may reflect better integration of 
				and access to content compared to the immediate free recall. Kintsch

				Magliano, Millis, 
				Ozuru and McNamara
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(2007)</span>, and others emphasize that the reading comprehension process 
				continues after the physical reading activity ceases. In particular, further integration of content 
				continues:

			<p class="quote noIndent">
				Once the net is constructed, the integration process takes over: Activation is spread 
				around until the system stabilizes
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="73">(Kintsch, 1988; pg. 168)</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the SBF, integration occurs through a mechanism of enhancement that increases the activation 
				of contextually relevant information
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Gernsbacher, 1996)</span>.
				The increased activation of 
				information within the framework may allow quicker retrieval of that content in the delayed free 
				recall.
			</p>

			<p>
				Although readers recalled more CIUs in both recalls, and were more efficient in the 
				delayed free recall, they did not demonstrate  better cohesiveness of recall. A more coherent 
				understanding of chapter content with strategy use was hypothesized to be reflected through a 
				more cohesive discourse sample detected by latent semantic analysis at the sentence-to-sentence

				Several possible explanations may account for the lack of significant difference 
				between RS and ST conditions for the LSA measures.  First, the measures may not be sensitive 
				enough to detect differences in discourse cohesion between the free recalls in the strategy and 
				no-strategy conditions. Related, LSA measures may not be the best proximal indicator of 
				coherent understanding for this study design. LSA has been used successfully when comparing 
				iterative productions from the same individual on the same topic, but may not be as helpful when 
				comparing two productions from the same individual but on different topics
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(McNamara et al., 2006)</span>. Third, the ABI population has known deficits in discourse production that include poor 
				use and organization of structural elements
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Coehlo, 1999;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Moran et al., 2011)</span>.
				Discerning between coherence of understanding and discourse generation deficits may be difficult through 
				evaluation of cohesion indicators; evaluating coherence of understanding through free recalls in 
				the ABI population may be too unreliable. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Despite the lack of difference on the LSA measures, the significant findings on the CIU 
				and CIU/minute variables with the modest, but respectable effect sizes provides positive support 
				that individuals with ABI can benefit from reading comprehension strategies to improve quantity 
				and efficiency of recall.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Effects of Strategy Use on Accuracy and Type of Recall 
			</h2>

			<p>
				Research Question 3 asked whether readers with ABI would perform better when 
				provided with the reading strategies as measured by overall accuracy and response patterns on 
				the sentence verification task. On the sentence verification tasks, readers performed better when 
				provided with reading strategies. The results showed a significant relationship between the

				strategy condition and how participants performed on the sentence verification tasks. This 
				relationship was demonstrated when the paraphrase, local and global statements were considered 
				as a composite, and accounted for 58.6% of the variance in scores.  When the three statement 
				types in the sentence verification task were considered individually, strategy condition accounted 
				for 50.4 % of the variance in the local cohesion scores, and 25.0% of the variance in the global 
				cohesion scores. Strategy condition did not have a differential influence on the scores of the 
				paraphrase items.
			</p>

			<p>
				The rationale for the expectation that participants would improve their accuracy of 
				response on the sentence verification tasks stems from the Structure Building Framework.  The 
				design of test items as described in Chapter III and Appendix D was based on the SBF 
				conceptualization that text understanding evolves over time at two different levels: globally and 
				locally
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="50">Graesser et al., 2003;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="74">Kintsch, 2004;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="83">Lorch, 1995)</span>. Global 
				coherence develops as ideas within a text are related to the overall theme of the text 
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="49">Graesser & Forsyth, 1997; Kintsch, 2004; Kintsch & van Dijk, 1978)</span>. 
				Local coherence develops as common constituents between sentences in close proximity are 
				recognized
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="40">(Gernsbacher, 1991, 1997;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="49">Graesser & Forsyth, 1997;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="74">Kintsch, 2004;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="75">Kintsch & van Dijk, 1978)</span>.
				The positive outcome on the local cohesion and global cohesion sentence types 
				provides support that reading comprehension strategies are associated with an improvement in 
				accuracy in recognizing concepts that reflect these two different levels of a coherent 
				understanding. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The lack of significant change on the paraphrase items was unexpected. As noted in 
				Chapter III, the internal reliability of these items was on the borderline between adequate and 
				good, less than the other two categories of item types. One possible artifact of the test items is 
			</p>

			<div class="pagebreak">
				<span class="pageNumber">
					68
				</span>
			</div>

<!-- Page 69 -->

			<p>
				that the paraphrase items may have included more details compared to the local and global 
				cohesion statements, which could have made them more challenging. The reading strategy 
				package used in this study did not specifically target recall of facts and details. 
			</p>

			<p>
				As an overall measure of better understanding, the findings are encouraging. The findings 
				are a promising suggestion that RS improve not only quantity and efficiency of comprehension, 
				as measured by the free recall task, but also the coherence of understanding. Perhaps, as 
				suggested above, the selected free recall measures do not detect changes in coherence of 
				understanding, but a task like the sentence verification task may be a sensitive indicator.
				Certainly, in this early stage of research, inferences regarding what aspects of the actual 
				comprehension process were measured must be made cautiously and tentatively. The measure is 
				experimental, and further validation is needed to claim the purported constructs are adequately 
				represented. 
			</p>

			<h2>
				Study Limitations
			</h2>

			<p>
				The purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether using a multi-component, 
				reading comprehension strategy package (RS) improves reading comprehension performance of 
				individuals with a history of mild to moderate acquired brain injury. While the results are 
				promising, the limitations of the study highlight the need for more research in order to 
				adequately address the reading comprehension impairments of adults with acquired brain injury. 
				The current study encourages future research and provides direction for the design of studies. 
				Study limitations and suggestions are organized according to methodology and population issues. 
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Methodological issues.</strong> The research design was developed to control for many known, 
				potentially confounding variables. For example, to control for the effects of differences in

			<p class="noIndent">
				aspects such as text structure and background knowledge on comprehension, the study only used 
				expository text drawn from one textbook from one discipline area. While the design did help 
				constrain variability due to these potential effects, the restrictions limit the ability to generalize 
				the findings to other text structures and genres. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The study was also conducted in collaboration with a community college based acquired 
				brain injury program located on one campus site. The benefit of this collaboration was the high 
				level of ecological validity; the intervention developed for this study is targeted to adult college 
				students with ABI. However, the limitation to one site may have introduced variability unique to 
				that location and population; this issue further limits generalization of findings.
			</p>

			<p>
				In Chapter II, the lack of validated reading comprehension tools was identified as one of 
				the barriers facing reading research and intervention
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Pearson & Hamm, 2005;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="106">RRSG, 2002;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">Sweet, 2005)</span>.
				The dependent variables used for this study were experimental. The evaluation of 
				the measures reported in Chapter III provided support that they possessed a generally, “good” 
				level of reliability, and as previously noted, standardized measures were not available. Still, as 
				experimental measures, they are more vulnerable to error than standardized measures would 
				have been, need to be interpreted with caution, and as discussed above, may not be sensitive to 
				clinically significant differences in individuals.   
			</p>

			<p>
				An additional methodological limitation was that the researcher was the primary 
				interventionist, and was not blind to the conditions. A bias toward the strategy condition may 
				have inadvertently influenced delivery of instructions. To prevent this from happening, parallel 
				scripts were established to constrain delivery of instructions in both conditions, and all sessions 
				were recorded. In addition, an instructor from the CCC ABI program was trained and delivered

			<p class="noIndent">
				10% of the reading sessions. Nonetheless, replicating the study with trained instructors will be 
				important to further validate the findings.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Within-population variability.</strong> The goal of this study was to evaluate whether adult 
				college students with ABI would benefit from using reading comprehension strategies.  As a 
				group, this benefit was demonstrated. However, not all participants benefited, and some seemed 
				to benefit more than others. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In Chapter II, the inherent variability of the ABI population was addressed. Narrowing 
				the inclusion criteria used in this study for the purposes of research might have limited the
				variability somewhat; however, the clinical population seeking help for reading comprehension 
				issues after ABI is diverse. Clinical researchers need to find the commonalities within the 
				population, while also responding to the diversity. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In this study, the constraints of the research design required implementing the reading 
				comprehension strategies in a manner that does not necessarily match best clinical practices. For 
				example, all individuals received all reading comprehension strategies. Other supports that may 
				benefit readers besides strategies, such as text to speech, were not available to avoid confounding 
				interpretation of improved outcomes. However, the clinical reality is that not all clients need, or 
				benefit from, the same reading comprehension strategies and supports. A more clinically 
				effective approach will be to match strategies and supports to particular needs and abilities. The 
				findings from this study provide a basis for further evaluating individual differences.
			</p>

			<p>
				An equally important clinical practice that was not included as part of this study is 
				systematic training of the strategies. Given the focus of the research question and the constraints 
				of the research design, systematic instruction was not provided. The positive response to

			<p class="noIndent">
				systematic instruction within the ABI population is well established
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref=0"">(Sohlberg & Mateer, 2001;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="122">Sohlberg & Turkstra, 2011)</span>.
				Quite possibly the benefit of reading comprehension strategies 
				noted by the findings of this study would have been greater had systematic instruction and 
				practice using the strategies been included as a component of the intervention. The inclusion of 
				systematic instruction with reading comprehension strategy training will be important to validate.
			</p>

			<h2>
				Extending the Findings to Future Research
			</h2>

			<p>
				In this section, three of the research needs suggested by the findings of this study as well 
				as by other issues that arose through the process of conducting this study are discussed. These 
				needs include: (1) continued clinical research to develop and evaluate reading comprehension 
				interventions for adults with ABI, (2) more basic research to better understand reading 
				comprehension in adults with ABI, and (3) further development and evaluation of technology 
				tools that might support or facilitate improvement in the reading comprehension abilities of 
				adults with ABI.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Clinical intervention research.</strong> The findings of this study validate further investigation
				into the use of reading comprehension strategies as an intervention approach for adults with ABI 
				who complain of problems with reading after their injury. Given that jobs after college 
				increasingly require knowledge in science, technology, engineering, and medicine
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="0">(Lee & Spratley, 2008)</span>,
				evaluating reading comprehension performance and response to strategies in 
				alternative disciplines are particularly important. Evaluating the impact of reading 
				comprehension strategies with participants from a range of settings is also crucial to discern 
				between generalizable effects and setting specific effects.  
			</p>

			<div class="pagebreak">
				<span class="pageNumber">
					72
				</span>
			</div>

<!-- Page 73 -->

			<p>
				Besides additional validation studies regarding the impact of a general reading 
				comprehension strategy package, clinical intervention research is needed to incorporate and 
				evaluate clinical best-practices including systematic training and matching particular strategies to 
				individuals. The knowledge needed to do this requires two approaches. Through a series of 
				single case research studies, the effects of particular strategies or sets of strategies on the reading 
				comprehension performance of different individuals faced with different reading demands can be 
				evaluated. The findings of these studies would need to be considered in light of findings learned 
				from basic research approaches conducted to determine whether individuals with ABI can be 
				characterized into different ability profiles.  Methods for generating this basic knowledge are
				discussed in the following section.
			</p>

			<p>
				For both future group studies and single case studies, evaluating the impact of reading 
				comprehension interventions requires assessing reading comprehension. Assessment is also 
				important for developing clinical treatment plans specific to clients’ needs and abilities
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="119">(Sohlberg & Mateer, 2001;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="122">Sohlberg & Turkstra, 2011)</span>.
				Given the lack of validated and reliable measures, 
				intervention research will need to include developing or adapting tools drawn from related 
				applied fields or the experimental literature. The results from this study validate use of free recall 
				and sentence verification tasks as methods for assessing the impact of reading comprehension 
				interventions. Within free recall tasks, use of total correct information units and efficiency of 
				recall were sensitive to differences between strategy and no-strategy conditions. Further 
				evaluation of other discourse measures, such as causal coordinator to participle ratios
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="129">(Griffiths, & Sohlberg, 2012)</span>
				may provide additional insights into the differential impact of interventions.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Basic research.</strong> As discussed in Chapter II, more knowledge is needed to better 
				understand the reading comprehension process in both proficient and impaired readers, and the

				cognitive underpinnings for reading comprehension. Increasing the understanding of reading 
				comprehension in adult readers with ABI will contribute both to the clinical literature base for 
				this population as well as to the general knowledge base about reading comprehension. Although 
				not the focus of this dissertation, several cognitive, language, and other reading measures were 
				given to the participants in the current study to help establish profiles of this population. Using 
				these measures to comprehensively describe this population will begin the process of 
				understanding the impact of acquired cognitive impairments on reading comprehension. 
			</p>

			<p>
				These data can be used to further explore whether underlying clusters of characteristics 
				can be used to identify category profiles within this population, and whether certain 
				characteristics or clusters of characteristics can predict how well individuals benefit from use of 
				reading comprehension strategies. As indicated earlier, being able to characterize and profile the 
				reading abilities of adults with ABI will be important for being able to select appropriate 
				interventions for individuals. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Generating additional sources of data to contribute to the general knowledge base can 
				happen in conjunction with clinical research studies.  As with clinical intervention research, valid 
				and reliable assessment methods are needed for research conducted to illuminate the nature of 
				reading comprehension and reading comprehension problems in adults with ABI. 
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Evaluation and development of technology tools.</strong> Technology tools were instrumental 
				in the delivery of the reading comprehension strategy package, as well as for the analysis of the 
				results. Both reading conditions were delivered via a web-based program. For the purposes of 
				this dissertation, technology was employed to insure consistent delivery of conditions, as well as 
				to track details about participant usage. In the strategy condition, prompts and instructions to

				complete strategy steps were provided electronically. In clinical situations, without technology,
				clients must either remember to do these steps, or remember to look at an external aid such as a 
				written checklist to do the steps, or be reminded by another person to do them, practices some 
				clients report as cumbersome or limiting
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="53">(Griffiths et al., 2010)</span>.
				Technology can help ease the 
				burden of remembering without increasing dependency on another person. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The results of this study provide empirical support for exploring how technology can be 
				employed to support readers’ use of reading comprehension strategies. Using technology to 
				directly provide prompts and reminders is one possibility; use of technology as external 
				reminders is an intervention approach with strong empirical support within cognitive 
				rehabilitation
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="69">(Kennedy et al, 2008)</span>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The capacity to track and analyze copious amounts of data “behind the scenes” while 
				readers continue to read also provides tremendous potential for further customizing reading 
				comprehension supports.  For example, tracking and analyzing student behavior in order to 
				provide customized feedback is a growing area within education and has potential for reading 
				comprehension with the ABI population
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="119">(Biancarosa, & Griffiths, 2012;</span>
				<span class="cite-use" data-ref="122">Sohlberg & Turkstra, 2011)</span>.
				The data tracking capacity of technology has implications for use in overall assessment of 
				reading comprehension as well.
