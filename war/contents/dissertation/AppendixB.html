				<u>Major Idea(s):</u>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Although centralized government is a fairly recent phenomenon in the history of 
					human society, centralized government is now a global phenomenon that shapes 
					the way we live. 
				</li>
			</ul>

				<u>Supporting Idea(s)</u>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					With few exceptions, the world is divided into sovereign entities governed by 
					central authorities.
				</li>

				<li>
					Early archeologists assumed the emergence of centralized government was an 
					improvement for civilization.
				</li>

				<li>
					Lewis Henry Morgan and V. Gordon Childe believed centralized government and 
					complex social structures were the next step toward progress after the 
					development of agriculture.
				</li>

				<li>
					Modern archeologists see the development of political complexity as a process 
					that requires explanation and cannot simply be viewed as a natural result of 
					progress.
				</li>

				<li>
					Political and social complexity increases social inequality while reducing personal 
					autonomy.
				</li>

				<li>
					The legitimacy of centralized government was likely established through a 
					combination of consensus and coercion.
				</li>
			</ul>

				<u>Major Idea(s): </u>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Anthropologists have developed different schemes to model commonalities in the 
					ways political complexity develops.

			<ul>
				<li>
					Morton H. Fried and Elman Service both see political complexity as a move from 
					kin-based to non kin-based governments.
				</li>

				<li>
					Fried defined societies based on how prestige is marked, while Elman Service 
					defined societies based on how power is exerted.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="noIndent">
				<u>Supporting Idea(s):</u>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Morton H. Fried (1967) defined four different types of societies based on how 
					prestige is marked:
				</li>

				<li>
					Egalitarian – Status based on combination of skill, age, and gender; production 
					and exchange kin-based, reciprocal
				</li>

				<li>
					Ranked – Status based on hierarchy of a single attribute (e.g., birth order); those 
					with prestige status oversee distribution but do not consume more; prestige carries 
					little political power.
				</li>

				<li>
					Stratified – Status linked to access to resources; access to resources creates 
					disparities in power; disparities in power lead to exploitation, for example, forced 
					labor. Organization based in kin and communities of people.
				</li>

				<li>
					States – Status organized on a supra-kin base with increased centralized power, 
					enforced by boundaries, legal system, military/police, taxation, and conscription. 
					Increased control of access to resources.
				</li>

				<li>
					Elman Service (1971) defined four different types based on how power is exerted: 
				</li>

				<li>
					Bands: similar to Fried’s egalitarian
				</li>

				<li>
					Tribes, similar to Fried's ranked societies; 
				</li>

				<li>
					Chiefdoms – Intermediate level of social complexity with central authority based 
					on heredity. Defer to religious authority. 
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>
					States – Central authority accepted through monopolization and controlled use of 
					force.

			<p class="noIndent">
				<u>Major Idea(s):</u>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					V. Gordon Childe characterized  urban areas based on visible traces in 
					archeological record, but other  anthropologists point out these features are not 
					well-defined and may be present in rural towns and villages.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="noIndent">
				<u>Supporting Idea(s):</u>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					V. Gordon Childe proposed ten criteria which have visible traces in the 
					archeological record, urban centers, surplus production and storage, taxes to a 
					deity or king, monumental architecture, a ruling class, writing systems, exact and 
					predictive sciences, sophisticated art styles, foreign trade, and specialist 
					craftsmen.
				</li>

				<li>
					Henry Wright & Gordon Johnson distinguished between three different levels of 
					settlement sizes as a more reliable way to characterize societies, with different 
					size settlements reflect different administrative structures. 
				</li>

				<li>
					Norman Yoffee (2005) noted the rise of cities was also the birth of the origin of 
					rural towns and villages.

				Type: Heading—A Comparative Approach to State Formation
			</h2>

			<h2 class="center">
				Organizational pattern of section: Description & Compare/Contrast:

			<p class="noIndent">
				<u>Major Idea(s):</u>
			</p>	

			<ul>
				<li>
					Utilizing a comparative approach to describe state formation has advantages but 
					also disadvantages that can lead to misleading conclusions.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="noIndent">
				<u>Supporting Idea(s)</u>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					A comparative approach does not account for unique differences in a society's 
					social structure or evolution; 
				</li>

				<li>
					Emergence of inequality in societies does not follow just one course.
				</li>

				<li>
					Societies in northwest coast of North America maintained hunter-gatherer 
					lifestyle, typically associated with egalitarian societies, yet had complex social 
					hierarchy that included slavery.
				</li>

				<li>
					Individual differences may be better represented on a continuum.
				</li>

				<li>
					A comparative approach does allow anthropologists to compare/contrast 
					regularities across societies.
				</li>

				<li>
					Transition to state societies took place independently in a number of regions.
				</li>

				<li>
					States may be divided into primary states (which form without external 
					neighboring influences) and secondary states (which form with influence from 
					neighboring state societies).
				</li>

				<li>
					Empires are formed when states' aggressive expansion campaign unites several 
					heterogeneous groups under one ruler.
				</li>

			<p class="noIndent">
				<u>Major Idea(s):</u>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Some theories propose a single factor caused state formation while others suggest 
					multiple factors contributed.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="noIndent">
				<u>Supporting Idea(s):</u>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Karl Wittfogel proposed the reliance on agriculture required organization of large 
					groups of workers to build irrigation, which created a hierarchical government 
					and thus, state formation.
				</li>

				<li>
					Robert Carniero proposed state formation developed as through a dynamic 
					interaction between geography, population increase, and competition for limited 
					resources.

			<ul>
				<li>
					As societies get larger, inequality arises as power becomes institutionalized.

			<ul>
				<li>
					Development of specialized craft skills; writing and math systems; as well as
					control of information and resources were sources of power in early state 
					societies.
				</li>

				<li>
					Power may also have identified in those with connections to the gods, or from 
					symbols of power (e.g., thrones, scepters) that may have inspired fear, awe, or 
					loyalty.
