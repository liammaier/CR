				<strong>Abstract</strong> A method for requirements analysis is proposed
				that accounts for individual and personal goals, and the
				effect of time and context on personal requirements. First
				a framework to analyse the issues inherent in requirements
				that change over time and location is proposed.
				The implications of the framework on system architecture are
				considered as three implementation pathways:
				functional specifications, development of customisable
				features and automatic adaptation by the system. These
				pathways imply the need to analyse system architecture
				requirements. A scenario-based analysis method is described for
				specifying requirements goals and their potential change. The method
				addresses goal setting for
				measurement and monitoring, and conflict resolution
				when requirements at different layers (group, individual)
				and from different sources (personal, advice from an
				external authority) conflict. The method links requirements analysis
				to design by modelling alternative solution pathways. Different
				implementation pathways have
				cost–benefit implications for stakeholders, so cost–benefit analysis
				techniques are proposed to assess trade-offs
				between goals and implementation strategies. The use of
				the framework is illustrated with two case studies in assistive
				technology domains: e-mail and a personalised
				navigation system. The first case study illustrates personal
				requirements to help cognitively disabled users
				communicate via e-mail, while the second addresses
				personal and mobile requirements to help disabled users
				make journeys on their own, assisted by a mobile PDA
				guide. In both case studies the experience from requirements analysis
				to implementation, requirements monitoring, and requirements evolution is reported.

			<h2>
				1 Introduction
			</h2>

			<p>
				Functional requirements have traditionally been considered as
				specifications that satisfy the goals of the
				majority of users. Although the concept of establishing
				sub-sets of requirements matched to different stakeholder groups
				has been advocated in the viewpoint tradition of requirements engineering, e.g.
				[<span class="cite-use" data-ref"1">1<span>] (VORD) and
				[<span class="cite-use" data-ref"2">2<span>], the concept of specifying requirements for individual
				users has not been explored. However, in human computer interaction,
				requirements are seen as an individual
				concern for customising the user interface and matching
				the mix of functional requirements to individuals [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"3">3<span>].
			</p>

			<p class="indent">
				Variability and specialisation of generic requirements
				to fit more specialised usage domains have been investigated in
				the product-line literature [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"4">4<span>] as variation
				points that specify where generic requirements may be
				tailored. The individual dimension of requirements has
				been partially addressed in the i* modelling language
				where the capability and abilities of agents can be
				specialised to model the skills and preferences of individuals [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"5">5<span>],
				so the requirements for individual users
				could be matched to ability profiles. Recognition that
				requirements may change over time because the system
				environment or context changes has been explored in
				requirements monitoring [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"6">6<span>], where monitors track a
				requirement over time to evaluate the match or mismatch between
				system operation and particular goals.
			</p>

			<p class="indent">
				In spite of these initiatives, no comprehensive method
				for analysing individual or contextual requirements has
				been proposed. We argue that a framework for individual requirements
				is necessary as technology products

				become personalised. Furthermore, with the growth in
				ubiquitous computing, requirements may not only vary
				by individuals but may also change over space and time
				in location-aware systems [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"7">7<span>], [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"8">8<span>]. In this paper we propose
				a framework for Personal and Contextual
				Requirements, a method for their capture incorporating
				a trade-off analysis to decide how personal requirements
				should be implemented. The following section describes
				related work; Sect.3 discusses the framework and
				implications for architectural requirements; Sect. 4
				develops the PC-RE (Personal and Contextual Requirements
				Engineering) method which is applied to two assistive technology
				case studies in Sect.5. This is followed
				by a description of the cost–benefit trade-off analysis in
				Sect.6. The paper concludes with a brief discussion.

				2 Related Work

			<p>
				Several requirements taxonomies have been proposed
				that classify requirements into different categories of
				non-functional requirements (NFRs) [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"9">9<span>], [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"10">10<span>], functional
				requirements and services [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"11">11<span>], [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"12">12<span>]; indeed, taxonomy is
				an accepted means of managing requirements in RE
				tools. However, previous taxonomies have classified
				requirements according to their subject matter rather
				than to the agents to which they pertain. Monitoring the
				implemented system against requirements so it can
				adapt to evolving requirements over time was proposed
				by [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"6">6<span>], while the impact of location on requirements was
				partially explored in the Inquiry Cycle [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"13">13<span>], where the
				location could influence the acceptability of system
				output. However, there has been no systematic treatment of
				contextual influences on requirements.
			</p>

			<p class="indent">
				Requirements for stakeholder groups are familiar in
				RE methods (e.g. ScenIC [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"14">14<span>]; Volere [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"2">2<span>]); however,
				change over time is not explicitly modelled apart from
				concerns over requirements creep and evolution. Change
				in location is rarely specified, even though globalisation
				and cultural effects on products are known to be
				important [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"15">15<span>], [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"16">16<span>]. Understanding cultural impact on
				requirements is still in its infancy, although ethnographic
				studies suggest that very different requirements
				arise in situ; for instance, privacy requirements for
				automatic teller machines are very different between
				eastern and western societies [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"17">17<span>].
			</p>

			<p class="indent">
				The mutability of requirements to suit individual
				users has been accepted in human computer interaction,
				where a distinction is drawn between generic task support
				requirements (i.e. functional requirements) and
				system features which can be customised for individual
				user needs [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"16">16<span>], [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"18">18<span>]. Two architectural approaches to
				handling personal requirements are adaptive systems, in
				which the system monitors the user’s behaviour and then
				changes services or the interface look and feel to match
				the user’s needs; and adaptable systems, where customisation
				is user-controlled at design time [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"19">19<span>]. Enduser programming
				applications often employ mixed
				initiative dialogues and fusion of these two strategies
			</p>

			<p>
				[<span class="cite-use" data-ref"20">20<span>]. Temporal and spatial change in requirements has
				implications for requirements capture and system
				architecture which have yet to be fully explored in the
				RE community.

			<h2>
				3 A framework for personal, contextual RE
			</h2>

			<p>
				The motivation for the framework is to describe not
				only functions that meet people’s goals but also
				characteristics of the users, and how they would like computer systems to achieve their personal goals. The
				framework accommodates matching requirements to
				individual needs, how individual needs change over
				time, how requirements evolve as people learn and their
				ambitions grow, and finally the needs for universal
				accessibility and the ageing user population [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"3">3<span>].
			</p>

			<p class="indent">
				We propose a three-layer framework for personal and
				contextual requirements, with two change dimensions of
				location and time which act on each layer, as summarised
				in Fig. 1. The layers progress from general requirements
				at the user group layer, to individual user characteristics,
				and to personal goals. Within each layer requirements
				vary over space and time to encourage not only analysis
				for evolving requirements but also contextual influences.
				Contextual influences may vary from the cultural and
				social system environment to effects of specific locations.
			</p>

			<br />

			<p>
				<em>Stakeholder group</em>  In this layer, the change context
				affects requirements in cultural adaptation of products,
				e.g. language localisation, change in business processes
				between European and American models; while time
				influences how requirements change as business processes
				evolve and product functionality becomes more
				complex [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"21">21<span>]. Contextual enquiry by surveys and
				prototype evaluations in different cultures are necessary
				to specify product versions for different cultural
				markets. The architectural considerations are design of
				products with variation points so they can be configured
				for different cultures, although the extent and
				nature of cultural adaptations are still poorly understood.
				Other architectural implications are design for
				customisation to accommodate context effects (language
				localisation); design of monitors and adaptive
				functions for mobility; customisable or adaptive user
				interfaces to deal with user skills change; and a flexible
				adaptable architecture to evolve as business processes
				change.
			</p>

			<br />

			<p>
				<em>User characteristics</em>  This layer models the needs of
				the individuals who share a common profile of skills
				and abilities that influence how they interact with
				technology. User characteristics are an individual user
				ability profile, which can be used to customise the
				means of human computer communication for the
				elderly, disabled, people with different learning
				styles, etc. Location affects user characteristics as
				people’s abilities change with place, such as the need
				for adapting communication modalities in noisy

<!-- Page 3 -->

			<p>
				environments, while people’s skills and abilities change
				over time as they adapt, for example, to computerbased
				training. Architectural implications are for
				choice and adaptive communication modalities. In the
				general user population, baseline knowledge will
				influence content in website and CAL applications,
				while in assistive technology this layer is key. The user
				characteristics layer describes the users’ physical and
				mental abilities, so this affects requirements for interaction
				directly as well as functional requirements
				indirectly. User characteristics requirements imply the
				need to develop individually tailored versions of
				applications that are either configured for the user at
				design time or automatically adapt to the user’s needs.
				Change over time occurs as people learn system
				functions and need new styles of dialogue as they
				become more skilled; while slower change, e.g.
				age-related decline in cognitive and motor abilities,
				necessitates change in magnified visual displays and
				slower response times. The range of individual user
				abilities needs to be analysed against inventories of
				modality abilities, knowledge and capabilities, and
				general cognitive abilities. User characteristics are assessed
				by psychology-based questionnaires and tests to
				measure cognitive, physical and perceptual abilities
				(e.g. [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"22">22<span>]) or by interviewing users to gather information
				on general abilities, experience and skills [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"23">23<span>].
				Assessing the user’s characteristics also produces an
				inventory of specific skills that we assume the user
				possesses to successfully operate the system given the
				user interface requirements for communication and
				interaction. These user characteristics are a complementary
				specification of what we can reasonably expect of the user
				(individually and collectively) and
				what needs to be implemented to enable effective use
				of the system.
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>Personal goals</em>  We argue it is important to analyse
				requirements from an individual viewpoint, especially in
				domains where customisation is important. In this layer,
				change over time depends on the stability of people’s
				wishes, while the contextual interaction may be influenced
				by how their goals affect location and social setting (e.g.
				social settings may influence privacy and hence
				display of personal information). Personal goals are held
				by individuals and become important in applications
				where customisation of individual service is a prime
				objective, e.g. learning and training applications,
				entertainment and games, personal knowledge management
				and assistive technology. Models of individual users
				have always been important for educational applications
				where the abilities of each individual are matched to
				content and pedagogical delivery.
			</p>

			<p class="indent">
				The type of requirements in each layer and their
				interaction with the change and context dimension are
				summarised in Table1. It should be noted that the
				layers do not imply a hierarchy of requirements; rather,
				the layers represent concerns that pertain to stakeholder
				groups or individuals.
			</p>

			<p class="indent">
				Personal goals can be realised either by design or
				customisation, e.g. by configuring the toolbar in drawing
				applications, or by automatically adapting solutions to
				the individual’s needs. Personal requirements may be
				contextual and location sensitive; for example, NFRs
				such as privacy, security and information accuracy can
				interact with functional requirements such as information
				display, according to location. Some personal goals
				may be implemented as preference settings under user
				control, e.g. the presentation of information (graphs
				and/or tables), and aesthetic details such as screen savers
				and ring tones on mobile phones. Personal goals are
				assigned attainment levels on a 1–5 scale so we can assess
				how well the system and user have approached the

				4 Scenario-based personal contextual requirements analysis
			</h2>

			<p>
				In this section we develop the PC-RE framework into a
				scenario-based requirements analysis method, based on
				our previous work with CORE and SCRAM [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"24">24<span>], [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"25">25<span>].
				CORE used ethnographic techniques to investigate
				users’ requirements in context, and then employed
				prototyping or Wizard of Oz techniques to evaluate initial
				designs with users and hence refine the requirements.
				CORE was motivated by assistive technology applications,
				so it emphasises a clinical profile of individual
				users’ abilities and attainment levels which are taken
				forward in the PC-RE method. PC-RE also follows the
				scenario-driven approach of SCRAM with mock-ups
				and early prototypes analysed in combination with design
				rationale to drive the requirements dialogue with
				users. PC-RE adds more guidance on the use of scenarios
				and developing requirements for individual user
				profiles. The method contains four sequences of investigation
				that can be deployed sequentially, although in
				practice requirements investigation tends to interleave
				issues from the four threads. Two threads—<em>analyse
				cultural context and analyse spatial context</em>—are motivated
				by the spatial dimension in the framework. The
				two threads <em>analyse temporal implications</em> and
				<em>analyse evolving requirements</em> correspond to the time dimension
				in the framework. The framework layers can apply to
				any of these threads, although the user characteristics
				and personal goals layers are covered in a fifth thread.
				Group stakeholder requirements analysis is not made
				explicit as these are an assumed default. Within each
				thread the specification/refine stages are motivated by
				the generic architecture for adaptive applications, as
				shown in Fig.2, and hence point to monitoring and
				adaptation issues. PC-RE is not intended to be a complete
				RE method so many issues such as modelling
				requirements specifications are not covered. Instead it is
				intended to supplement other methods (e.g. Volere [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"2">2<span>])
				with individual and contextual perspectives. Contextual
				requirements analysis deals with the issues of mobile
				applications, while the personal RE addresses the
				requirements for applications that focus on individual
				users, i.e. education, training, assistive technology,
				clinical medical systems and entertainment.
			</p>

			<section class="subsection" data-number="5" data-name="4.1 Method overview">

				<h3>
					4.1 Method overview
				</h3>

				<p>
					The road map for the PC-RE method is illustrated in
					Fig.3. The first step entails considering the type of
					application to determine requirements relating to individual
					users and/or changing requirements of a temporal or spatial nature. The results of this assessment
					will invoke one or more of the pathways that advise on
					capture and analysis for personal and contextual
					requirements. Many applications will concern more
					than one pathway, hence the method is applied iteratively.
					Most context-aware applications will invoke
					several pathways to address requirements for the five
					Ws [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"8">8<span>]: <em>Who</em>, the identity of an individual user; <em>What</em>
					the users are doing, interpreting their activity; <em>Where</em>
					they are located; <em>When</em> in time are certain services
					requirements, and when in a history of activity; and
					finally <em>Why</em>, capturing the users’ intent by deeper
					analysis of What. The first pathway deals with international
					applications, where the advice is given on
					analysing the effects of culture and then defining
					requirements for localising the systems and specifying
					how it will be configured or tailored for different versions.
					The second pathway addresses analysis of
					requirements for mobile and context-aware applications.
					The third and fourth pathways distinguish between predictable
					and less predictable change of
					requirements over time. Predictable change is implied in
					applications where time drives adaptation of functionality,
					for example, patient monitoring system in
					healthcare, or environmental control system in home
					use or industrial process control. The essence of predictable
					temporal change is that functional requirements are known,
					and the dependency between time
					and those requirements can be defined. Actual time
					periods may vary from seconds to days or months.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Temporally unpredictable changes occur in systems
					where evolution of requirements can be expected, but
					the nature of change cannot be anticipated in detail;
					when change might occur is also uncertain. In this case
					requirements analysis is similar to product-line architectures,
					where variation points are created for loci of
					potential change and requirements are made as adaptable as
					possible by generalisations. Finally, for applications in
					assistive technology, healthcare training and
					education, personal requirements are likely to be
					important. Advice on this pathway is given on defining
					personal goals and user profiles. This is followed by
					setting achievement levels and monitoring progress towards
					those goals. Several pathways share common
					process and advice on specifying the requirements for
					monitoring devices and requirements for adaptation to
					change over time or location. Finally, the pathways
					converge on common tasks that appear in all requirements
					engineering processes such as negotiation and
					requirements validation; these tasks are not described
					further in this paper.

					local cultural conditions. Ultimately, there is no substitute for sourcing scenarios from users who belong to
					the cultures, nationalities and linguistic groups in the
					intended market place. However, if culture-located users
					are not available, then the following guidelines can be
					used to challenge scenarios sourced in one culture (i.e.
					usually Europe or the USA), to consider requirements
					implications in other cultures. The inspiration for the
					guidelines comes from reports of requirements investigations and ethnographic studies in the RE and HCI
					literature [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"15">15<span>], [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"17">17<span>],

				<h3>
					4.3 Requirements for mobile and context-aware applications
				</h3>

				<p>
					The requirement problems in this pathway are first to
					define the number and type of spatial contexts that will
					change the requirements. In some cases requirements are
					closely coupled to the location; for instance, in a mobile
					tourist or museum guide the information content and
					user system dialogue have to be geared to the user’s
					location. Other requirements demand more complex
					interpretation of location so the system functions can be
					adapted to the users’ social or work context. An example
					is the use of notifier systems and dual task displays
					which will change according to whether the user is in a
					location that demands no interruption (e.g. public lecture) or in a more private space. A useful conceptual
					framework for considering the implications of space on
					requirements is the ‘‘locales’’ model [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"31">31<span>] which divides
					space into different categories according to social needs
					for NFRs of privacy, security, accuracy, etc. However,
					determining the nature of a social space is a non-trivial
					problem of sense-making from data about the user’s
					environment.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">	
					Monitoring requirements for mobile applications
					need to be specified for:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						The devices and sensors that capture environmental
						input, e.g. video, GPS, audio, light, movement
						detectors. Sensors may be active transmitters such
						as RFID tags in instrumented environments or
						passive devices that can work in non-instrumented
						environments, e.g. video, audio capture.
					</li>

					<li>
						Functions and processes to interpret low-level data
						streams into meaningful data, e.g. from a sensor
						voltage output to a temperature reading.
					</li>

					<li>
						Interpreters that make sense of the data using a
						model of the domain, e.g. body temperature above
						a certain threshold is dangerous for a patient and
						hence an alarm should be signalled.
					</li>

					<li>
						Models of the domain, either static or preferably
						dynamic, and updatable to reflect changes in the
						environment.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="pagebreak">
					<span class="pageNumber">
						7
					</span>
				</div>

<!-- Page 8 -->

				<p>
					Interpreters invariably rely on data fusion from several
					sensory inputs, so the requirements for handling several
					datastreams need to be investigated. A useful framework
					for considering the requirements for interpreters [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"32">32<span>]is
					to decide the level of change which needs to be inferred,
					ranging from the semaphore level (an event has happened);
					identity (the event or agent can be identified);
					attributes (properties of the event/object can be inferred);
					to causality of the event (intent of the agent can
					be explained). In a spatial context location might be
					Cartesian coordinates in a space, approximate location
					in a topology (near to) or exact location within a topographic model. The results of interpreters are frequently
					ambiguous so further requirements need to be considered for the mediation dialogues to help the user make
					effective use of context-aware applications [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"33">33<span>].
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Feedback functions are necessary to make the user
						aware of the system’s interpretations (or guesses)
						about the state of its environment. Confidence-level
						indications help people decide whether to accept the
						system’s decision.
					</li>

					<li>
						Default interpretations need to be defined when
						input data is not available, or is inadequate.
					</li>

					<li>
						Mediation dialogues should be planned so users can
						override the systems’ decision.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Once the output from the monitoring process has been
					defined, a further set of requirements are necessary to
					specify the system’s adaptation to change in location.
					The nature of adaptation will depend on the domain; in
					many cases it will be a change to users’ services to deal
					with change in NFRs such as privacy in different locales.
					In embedded systems, change may need to adapt to the
					environmental properties of the location, for instance a
					computerised automated braking system in a vehicle
					needs to adapt according to the location being a wet or a
					dry road.

				<h3>
					4.4 Predictable temporally variable requirements
				</h3>

				<p>
					This pathway covers applications where the system has
					to adapt its response over time, which might be at a
					specific point in time or periods in scales ranging from
					nanoseconds to years. Typical examples of systems in
					this class are environmental and process control systems
					in home use or industry (thermostats, time-based controllers of
					devices, time-based controllers of manufacturing process, chemical process control, etc.).
					Requirements for temporal monitoring are reasonably
					simple since a system clock will usually suffice, although
					interpretation of significant temporal events may not be
					non-trivial. Temporal logics as found in some requirements languages
					(e.g. KAOS [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"34">34<span>]) may be necessary to
					specify complex temporal dependencies, e.g. synchronisation,
					overlapping time intervals, less predictable temporal dependencies (until, eventually, etc.).
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Once temporally significant events have been specified, in common with other pathways, the next task is to
					specify how the system should adapt either at a point in
					time or for a duration. Some examples of predictable
					temporal change in requirements for user-centred systems are changing services during the day. In a notifier
					system, stock market updates may be sent between
					9 a.m. and 5 p.m. but after 5 p.m. schedules of TV
					shows or local entertainment would be more appropriate. This class of requirements and the following less
					predictable requirements are both deferred [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"35">35<span>], in the
					sense that they are analysed when the system is designed,
					but implementation is delayed until the context is
					appropriate, either at a point in time or when the system
					environment has evolved.

				<h3>
					4.5 Unpredictable but evolving requirements
				</h3>

				<p>
					Many applications potentially fall into this class, as
					requirements need to evolve as business changes. Product-line engineering is a response that attempts to
					anticipate evolving requirements by carrying out an
					exhaustive domain analysis, and then specify systems
					with stable core functionality and variation points where
					requirements change can be anticipated. Requirements
					can also be generalised to make them more adaptable for
					future implementations [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"36">36<span>]. Some guidelines for making
					requirements more generic are to:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Parameterise processes and procedures so the
						behaviour of a system can be changed by adjusting
						parameters on an initialisation file. In a computeraided learning application, parameterisation could
						be used to change the pedagogical strategy (explanation, demonstration, learning by example) used
						by the system according to the sophistication of the
						learner.
					</li>

					<li>
						Enable run-time binding of procedures and data
						structures, so the system can adapt by changing
						component libraries.
					</li>

					<li>
						Provide facilities for adding new functions at variation points.
					</li>

					<li>
						Make system architectures loosely coupled, so new
						modules can be added without upsetting too many
						dependencies.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Requirements for evolving systems become a process of
					design for reuse (see [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"18">18<span>]) in which as many functional
					requirements as can be anticipated in the future are
					specified; the system architecture is then designed to be
					sufficiently flexible for new components to be added and
					redundant ones deleted.

					4.6 Personal user requirements
				</h3>

				<p>
					In this pathway the individual user rather than change is

					a general product that can be used by many (individually
					different) users. Requirements for adaptation and monitoring processes are therefore necessary, for instance as
					users’ experience with a system grows they require less
					help and supportive dialogues, and access to more
					sophisticated power functions. System functionality
					should therefore be revealed gradually so users can learn
					without becoming overwhelmed by complexity [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"37">37<span>].
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					The processes in this pathway are first to define an
					individual user profile. These requirements are frequently set by
					another, expert stakeholder, e.g. the designer of a computer system defines user stereotypes, a
					clinician specifies an ability profile of an individual for a
					healthcare system, a teacher defines a profile for a student’s learning style and abilities. Personal goals are
					elicited directly from individuals and owned by them.
					For both personal goals and user profiles, attainment
					targets can be sets which become benchmarks for
					monitoring processes. Trade-off analysis is particularly
					important in this pathway because user profile goals set
					by an expert stakeholder may conflict with personal
					ambitions; furthermore, because goals are personal there
					are different costs and benefits that may be accrued in
					achieving them. In common with other pathways,
					requirements for adaptation are defined to complete the

					5.1 E-mail for cognitively disabled users
				</h3>

				<p>					
					We applied the PC-RE method to two projects: an
					e-mail system and a navigation support system for
					cognitively disabled users. An action research diary recorded our experiences in applying the method during
					the case studies, supplemented with debriefing sessions
					among the developers. The top-level goals in both projects were to empower these users socially and personally
					so they can communicate with one another and use
					public transport to meet others, etc.

					The requirements for the TAL e-mail case study are
					illustrated in Table 2. The first layer gives the grouplevel view of an e-mail system for cognitively disabled
					users, which is a simplified version of standard e-mail
					functions. The subsequent layers focus on two individuals, as space precludes describing the breadth of
					requirements for the six individuals in the study in this
					paper, although the diversity of requirements encountered will be discussed.

				<br />

				<p>
					<em>Group requirements</em>  Requirements were gathered by
					interviewing and focus group techniques with reference to
					the functions provided by existing e-mail products.
					Requirements have to take account of the diversity in
					cognitive disability, which include language problems
					(aphasia, dyslexia), working memory and wandering
					attention, planning and executive function disorders,
					poor learning and problem-solving abilities. These lead to
					requirements which supplement the e-mail application
					requirements, with communication and support needs for
					this user population, e.g. task completion lists, help and
					tutorial wizards, etc. Note that these requirements
					are present for all users, in particular to support learning
					and help systems; however, in assistive technology,

					communication and learning support, requirements assume a more prominent role. We have not illustrated
					requirements in detail for other stakeholder groups, but
					care providers and family respondents are two key groups
					who have requirements for e-mail communication and
					abilities to monitor the cognitively impaired users.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<em>Temporal and spatial implications</em>  For the whole group
					requirements were expected to change over time as the
					users might respond to the e-mail system with better
					social communication; however, analysis was more logically applied in the user characteristics and personal
					goal layers.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<em>Monitoring and adaptation implications</em>  Change over
					time suggested the need for monitors to keep users on
					task with reminders and task-completion lists, as well as
					tracking their performance to detect improvement in
					e-mail use. However, these concerns were refined in the
					following layers.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<em>Individual characteristics</em>  Requirements were gathered
					by the CORE method [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"24">24<span>], [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"39">39<span>]
					which uses a combination of focus groups, user interviews, scenario-based
					exploration with prototypes, coupled with expert
					judgement and performance tests for application and
					computer operation tasks. This creates a capability
					profile which is employed to select a sub-set of the group
					communication and learning support requirements to
					match the individual, as ‘‘prescription’’ for his/her profile. The requirements have to be inferred from the
					clinical profile, so user characteristics are similar to
					NFRs in that they have to be satisfied by computer
					support functions or training. In the e-mail domain we
					developed a 50-item skill inventory that complemented
					user characteristic requirements, rating each skill on a
					1–3 scale as missing/sporadic/possessed [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"24">24<span>].
					In Michael’s case (not his real name) attention focus and
					short-term memory problems indicated requirements for
					reminder agents to help with task initiation, with an
					agenda of task steps. Some examples of his skills profile
					were assumed (possessed) skills for motor coordination
					using the keyboard and mouse, and visual acuity suitable for standard VDU technology. Mary’s profile notes
					problems of social impulsiveness, and language and
					learning problems that indicate the need for a supportive
					system that also vets her messages to check for inappropriate sentences and words.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<em>Temporal and spatial implications</em>  For both Michael
					and Mary their performance was expected to improve
					over time as they learned the e-mail system and as their
					motor coordination skills improved with practice. There
					were no particular spatial considerations.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<em>Monitoring and adaptation implications</em> Change over
					time suggested the need to monitor users’ time and frequency of sessions, as well as tracking response times to
					detect improved motor coordination. Since monitoring
					had privacy implications, these were discussed with the
					users and monitoring only proceeded with their permission. No requirements for automatic adaptation
					were planned because the data had to be interpreted in
					light of the users’ clinical profiles by a skilled medical
					expert.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<em>Personal goals</em>  These are refined into specific requirements. In some cases the goals are attainment targets for
					group requirements; however, others need design suggestions from the requirements engineer. Furthermore,
					some solutions may be manually implemented in the
					social system, such as soliciting new e-mail partners who
					will then be registered by adding them to Michael’s recipient list. Personal goals can be non-functional in
					nature in the sense that they set aspirations which Michael wants to achieve. The attainment scale for
					achieving the overall personal goal ‘‘to use e-mail’’ was
					set in consultation with the user, to produce the following list, with level 1 representing ‘‘not attained’’ and
					level 5 ‘‘fully attained’’:
				</p>

				<table class="levelTable">

					<em>Temporal and spatial implications</em>  For both Michael
					and Mary the temporal implications were described in
					the monitoring levels described above. There were no

				<p>
					<em>Monitoring and adaptation</em>  Change over time can be
					anticipated as users acquire skills, although the exact
					nature of change can only be measured at the individual level. The time-scale for attaining goals at the
					personal level tends to be shorter term, but this is not
					always so. Change in user characteristics can be rapid if
					a treatment is effective. For this application there are
					fewer implications for spatial change. However, two
					contexts of use are anticipated: one in the user’s home,
					while the other will be on a shared computer placed in
					the common room of sheltered accommodation. The
					latter scenario has implications for privacy since other
					people could read personal messages being composed
					by the user. There is no immediate technical solution
					for this problem, although a pragmatic work-around is
					to suggest e-mailing at quiet times in the day when few
					other people will be in the common room.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Change over time can be tracked at the individual
					level either by automated monitoring software, e.g. the
					REQMON system [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"40">40<span>] which works in model-based
					mode by tracking changes in user behaviour and performance linked to a personal goal; or in pattern-based
					matching using data mining techniques to infer changes
					over time and probable causes. We also monitor by
					questionnaires and interview sessions with the users and
					care providers. Automated monitoring is economical but
					limited in the inferences that can be made from low-level
					data streams, i.e. messages sent, distribution of message
					by partners, words per message, latencies and time to
					compose messages, etc. Currently we intend to use
					latencies to drive a simple task list reminder function,
					while other monitored data, e.g. errors, functions used,
					frequencies and distribution of messages sent will be
					collected for manual analysis. Interviews will be employed to monitor the change in personal goals over
					time; for instance as Michael’s confidence grows, new
					partners and functionality (print and save messages)
					may be added to his configuration. In Mary’s case the
					editor will be added to her mailing lists once she has
					attained sufficient competence for her level 3 personal
					goal. Adaptations over a longer time period are anticipated in the individual’s e-mail recipient lists and the
					e-mail functions as their confidence grows. In the shorter
					time-scale the system needs to adapt its reminding
					function to help the individual users to complete messages, while not becoming annoying and intrusive.
					Getting the level of system initiative right is a difficult
					judgement which we believe has to be tuned with advice
					from the users. Given the simplified e-mail system we are
					using, most adaptation can be anticipated at design time;
					however, we do not claim perfect foresight so the
					architecture of the e-mail system has been constructed to
					enable new functions (e.g. forward message, multiple
					replies) to be added without major redesign.

					method with Wizard of Oz simulation of the route-following task. Normal and TBI users were asked to follow
					the navigation instructions given on a Personal Digital
					Assistant (PDA) display with speech in an earpiece. Two
					observers followed the user, one simulating the navigation instructions and
					dialogue using wireless communication between PDAs, with the other acting as an
					ethnographer recording user behaviour, problems and
					carrying out problem diagnosis interviews. This produced individual
					requirements profiles as well as contributing to the group requirements gathering. The
					individual user focus is illustrated with requirements for
					John, whose clinical characteristics are severe short-term
					memory loss leading to attention failure, forgetting to
					turn up for regular trips, the purpose of a journey and
					the destination.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<em>Temporal and spatial implications</em>  The spatial and
					temporal implications for John within each journey were
					deviations from the desired route. In the longer term
					more complicated and longer journeys were expected to
					be undertaken as John became familiar with the technology as well as learning the local geography.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<em>Monitoring and adaptation implications</em>  Change over
					time suggested the need to monitor the pathway on each
					journey, and the duration of stages, so reminders of the
					route could be given and directions for regaining the
					route if John lost his way.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<em>Personal goals</em>  Requirements to fulfil John’s personal
					goals are clear instructions for a limited set of routes, a
					bus journey guide, reminders for timetabled journeys
					and monitors with reminders when the destination is
					close. John’s personal goals are increased independent
					mobility for meeting his family and for recreation
					(sightseeing, cinema, festivals and undertaking his volunteer job at the YMCA). These goals specify the
					instructions and information content (route maps,
					landmark cues); however, while some routes are fixed
					(family, job) the recreation trips are time- and locationvariable, so there is a need for his care provider to
					configure new routes.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<em>Temporal and spatial implications</em>  The spatial and
					temporal implications for John’s personal requirements
					were set by his attainment levels which set out targets for
					successful journey completion and the types of journeys
					which could be undertaken. Over time John wished to
					make journeys for an increasing variety of different
					purposes as described above. More adventurous journeys involved navigating in more complex spaces (public
					festivals, cinemas).
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<em>Monitoring and adaptation</em>  Time-sensitive requirements are task initiation reminders since subjects often
					forget to make regular scheduled journeys and mistake
					their destination. Temporal change also has to account
					for learning effects, adding new routes, and more
					importantly the dynamic change of instructions
					according to the subjects’ location. Location is vital for
					delivering appropriate instructions, and triggering reorientation help if users deviate from the expected route.
					Requirements for the navigation system were several
					monitors for location and progress tracking using GPS,
					progress tracking with a pedometer when walking and
					simple location awareness by light intensity and noise
					levels to improve reasoning about location when offtrack (e.g. noisy or quiet streets, in building or outside).
					Use of multiple sensors creates a further requirement for
					an interpreter function which integrates all the sensor
					inputs checks with the route model and outputs an ‘‘on
					path/near path/not on path’’ message with a confidence
					rating. The more difficult task is to infer the user’s
					location in the near path/not on path conditions. The
					adaptive sub-system is a key component because of the
					need for re-orientation and error correcting dialogue, so
					system initiative will be used to help the user to regain
					the route, with instructions on looking for local landmarks and re-orientation. This will be backed up with a
					simple ‘‘find me’’ button for emergencies, connected
					directly to a care provider who can locate the user’s
					approximate position with GPS. We are also considering
					voice communication to the care provider to help reassure the user.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					For user characteristics and personal goal, temporal
					change in skills is anticipated. John is relatively young so
					there is a reasonable chance that he may improve with
					experience, hence the system may need to be adapted
					with more advanced facilities and more routes.
					Requirements for a route editor were added so care
					providers can adapt the system with additional routes.
					The system architecture is designed to allow new monitors to be added, although the interpreter will need to
					be changed to adapt a multisensor integration algorithm. Spatial context implications are similar for all
					users, namely the need for tracking to make sure the
					individual is on the route; re-orienting help is given if
					not. When we proposed technical solutions to personal
					requirements, it became clear that these solutions had
					different impacts on individual users, and on other
					stakeholders. This led us to consider how the costs and
					benefits of different technical solutions might be
					assessed.

				6 Cost–benefit analysis
			</h2>

			<p>
				Personal requirements at all levels imply a cost to individuals, either in customising the system themselves or in
				adapting their behaviour to a system that has changed
				automatically. For example, the costs of learning and
				using a computer system can outweigh the benefits for
				our TBI users even though the social and personal selfesteem rewards for many individuals are very important.
				The chosen implementation pathway also influences the
				distribution of costs and benefits between users and
				designers; for instance, configurable applications

				outsource design effort to the user. Furthermore, tradeoff between the user’s costs and benefits influence other
				stakeholders, particularly the care providers in our case
				studies. A conventional RE approach would be to use
				design rationale or goal modelling to investigate
				such trade-offs; however, such approaches do not afford comparison.
				To address this problem we propose a simple cost–benefit modelling technique that
				supplements design rationale or goal modelling. The
				technique consists of the following:
			</p>
				
			<ul>
				<li>
					Estimated benefits of achieving the desired goal. In
					our personal RE framework this will be assessed as
					a collective group or individual benefit according to
					the type of goal.
				</li>

				<li>
					Costs of each design alternative (sub-goal/functional requirement) proposed to achieve the goal.
					We distinguish between costs of learning to use the
					system, operational costs imposed on the user, and
					costs imposed on other stakeholders by that solution.
				</li>

				<li>
					Cost penalties if the solution alternative in question
					does not achieve the goal. This is a measure of
					reliability, as a composite assessment of the probability of failure, the severity of impact of failure,
					and the cost of recovery.
				</li>

				<li>
					Other NFRs can be added as potential costs if they
					are infringed. Alternatively, the achievement of
					NFRs may be considered to be part of the benefit of
					achieving the overall goal.
				</li>
			</ul>			

			<p>	
				Benefits are assessed by first asking users to estimate the
				potential satisfiability of the goal by the proposed
				technical solution (on a 1–10 scale). Benefits may also be
				assessed for user characteristics by expert judgement of
				value to the individual and how the system’s functions
				might fulfil their motivations, e.g. self-esteem, learning,
				social inclusion, etc. User costs are learning to use the
				system, operational effort, and cost of error recovery,
				which are added to indirect costs of customisation effort,
				and learning how to use customisation facilities. Costs
				may be estimated by requirements engineers, based on
				observations of user problems, or by interviews with
				users to acquire their perception of learning and operational cost.
			</p>

			<p class="indent">
				Benefits estimate the potential for a given design
				option achieving the goal. A simple percentage-satisfaction metric is calculated using the benefit estimated
				on a 1–100 scale, depending on the probable contribution of the solution alternative to achieving
				the higherlevel goal, minus the sum of all the costs:
			</p>

			<p class="formula">
				% Satisfaction = Benefits - sum(costs <span class="superscript">1-n</span>)
			</p>

			<p class="formula">
				where sum max (costs <span class="superscript">1-n</span>) = 100
			</p>

			<p class="indent">				
				The analysis also guides functional allocation decisions, i.e. whether to automate
				a requirement; implement it partially and supplement the computer system by
				training the user; or allocate the duty to another stakeholder.

				For example in Fig.4 the options for achieving the
				Improve Social Skills goal for Michael are to implement
				filters to trap any anti-social words and phrases with a
				stop list and style checker, or to add an enforce-reviewbefore-send, so Michael has to read and check his
				message before sending, or to send his message to his
				care provider so he/she can check it for any offensive
				words or phrases. The NFRs or argument criteria that
				assess the trade-off are the costs of implementation, the
				reliability of attaining the goal, and avoiding infringing
				Michael’s privacy.
			</p>

			<p class="indent">
				A sample of the cost–benefit analysis for the Improve
				Social Skills goal is given in Table4. Benefits are estimated on a 0–100 scale, while costs are scored on 100/
				cost variables x <em>n</em>, so in Table 4each cost is rated on a
				1–20 scale, yielding a potential net benefit of zero with
				maximal costs and maximum benefit, and a negative
				trade-off if costs are high and benefits small. Operation
				and learning costs map to the design rationale diagram,
				as do reliability of the option being effective, and privacy. The care provider vetting outgoing e-mails has the
				highest probability of achieving the goal, compared to
				filters which have a 50% chance of preventing unwanted
				e-mails, while the review-before-send relies on Michael’s
				diligence in checking his messages before sending. This
				was judged to be more risky. For Michael the costs of
				operation and learning were small for the filters option,

				but more effort would be required for reviewing messages. The care provider option was cost-free for him,
				but a burden for the care provider. The potential impact
				of errors reflected the cost of not achieving the goal and
				the costs of recovery, i.e. apologising to offended friends
				and family. The downside of the care provider option
				becomes clear when Michael’s privacy is considered,
				since all his e-mails would be available to the care provider. Furthermore, this option imposes a considerable
				workload on the care provider who has to check all
				outgoing e-mails and edit them. These penalties reduce
				the net benefit of this option to nearly the same as the
				filters option even though it has a higher initial benefit.
				While the estimates are subjective judgements, the value
				of the cost–benefit analysis is in using it as a sensitivity
				analysis tool to explore requirements trade-offs. A similar trade-off analysis occurred for Mary’s improve letter
				quality personal goal. In this case the design options
				were to screen output with automated style checkers,
				provide an online wizard to suggest topics and provide
				template letters, or to ask her friends to help as tutors.
				The last option was selected with the style checker, because these provided the better benefits, even though
				incurring more costs for the friend stakeholders. Help
				from her friends improved her motivation and confidence, in a manner that no computer wizard could
				achieve. Privacy was less of an issue with friends than it
				would have been with a professional care provider.
			</p>

			<p class="indent">
				The design rationale for a second goal, Keeping the
				User on Track so their attention does not wander, is
				shown in Fig.5. The issue in this case is helping the user
				to complete the e-mail composition task, when users’
				attention frequently wanders. Design alternatives are to
				display a task-completion agenda, similar to reminders in
				standard office products, to make the system actively
				monitor and remind the users if no action had been taken
				after a set time period. Finally the care provider could
				monitor the user via a video link. The criteria or costs by
				which the alternatives can be judged follow the pattern
				we describe earlier. The cost–benefit analysis for this user
				goal is given in Table5. The benefits of the active reminder and the care provider monitoring performance
				were judged to be similar, since the care provider would
				have to monitor the users continuously to achieve the
				goal, and this was open to some doubt. Operation and
				learning costs were minimal for the agenda and reminder
				options; however, reliability impact of reminders was
				often in doubt since setting the frequency and latency for
				system intervention was not easy to specify. Privacy was
				an issue for the reminder and care provider options since
				both would disrupt the user’s task or thought processes.
				The net balance was similar for the care provider and
				reminder options for this goal, but the reason why they
				differ becomes transparent. In this case the technical
				solution for an automatic reminder was chosen, while the
				care provider-vets option had already been chosen for
				the Improve Social Skills goal.

				Space precludes reporting further analysis of individual goals. For group requirements the technique
				clarified the trade-offs between different design solutions
				and costs imposed on primary users and other stakeholders (i.e. care providers). Customisation (e.g. add
				new filters or e-mail correspondents) by the users was
				ruled out because the additional learning and operating
				costs reduced the percentage-satisfaction to zero.
			</p>

			<p class="indent">
				Considerable help would have to be available from
				the designers or care providers (thereby increasing their
				costs) to make customisation effective, so the overall
				balance was not favourable even though it was still
				desirable to increase the fit between system functions
				and the user’s characteristics. However, some set-up
				configuration costs would be necessary for the solution
				to scale beyond the immediate locality where the
				designers can provide support. The cost–benefit analysis
				can be applied to the care provider stakeholders,
				assuming a large benefit will be altruistic motivation to
				overcome their costs of learning and setting up the system. While this assumption might be true for family and
				very dedicated professional care providers, it is doubtful
				for other less committed care providers. This outcome
				led to the investment to reduce learning and configuration burden as far as possible by CD-ROM advisors and
				training programmes and trying to distribute the support costs among a large stakeholder group.

				requirements investigation to consider spatial, temporal
				and individual concerns, followed by requirements for

				as a checklist of issues rather than a prescriptive ‘‘cook

				attainment levels, monitoring against them and the use
				of design rationale for trade-off analysis were specific
				techniques which guided requirements investigation
				more precisely. Some reflections on our experience with
				the trade-off analysis are that goals between different
				layers can conflict, e.g. the user can set a personal goal
				that is unrealistic in terms of their user characteristics,
				derived from expert clinical judgement. The cost–benefit estimation was very subjective so the numbers were
				not particularly trustworthy; however, the process did
				lead to useful debate for comparing trade-offs in the
				design rationale diagrams. We did consider ranking
				costs and benefits but this obscured the overall cost–
				benefit assessment. Finally, the method added a different perspective to conventional RE goal analysis by
				focusing on quantification of individual achievement,

			<h2>
				8 Discussion
			</h2>

			<p>
				This paper has proposed a new framework which introduces the concept of the individual user and context as a
				focus for requirements engineering. The method has
				synthesised and developed our previous research on
				requirements monitoring [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"6">6<span>], [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"39">39<span>], socio-technical
				requirements and functional allocation [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"18">18<span>]. The PC-RE
				method extends current RE methods, such as Volere [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"2">2<span>]
				and ScenIC [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"14">14<span>], by introducing requirements for individuals
				and providing guidance for requirements analysis
				that accounts for variation in requirements over space
				and time. PC-RE has drawn on influences from domain
				analysis methods for the concept of variation points
				familiar in product-line requirement methods and
				extends the stakeholder concepts present in most RE
				methods [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"2">2<span>], [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"41">41<span>]
				to individual users. In assistive technology
				applications, the focus on individuals is a necessary consequence of the wide range of abilities which
				affect not only human computer interaction but also
				matching functional requirements to individual capabilities. We argue that this approach generalises beyond
				assistive technology applications. Educational technology is one area where individual characteristics are
				important influences on design as learner profiles; another area is groupware applications where individual
				profiles often determine security and privacy requirements. However, with the growth in customised products,
				personal RE is becoming generally applicable to a wide
				range of office and home/entertainment applications.
			</p>

			<p class="indent">
				Personal RE has extended the boundaries of skillspreference analysis [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"42">42<span>]
				by connecting requirements to
				architecture, introducing cost–benefit analysis, and
				drawing the distinction between expert assessment of
				user characteristics and individually held goals. Hui
				et al.’s [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"42">42<span>] framework, based on i* and goal modelling,
				accounts for the skills profiles using a similar ontology
				to ours, and their preferences are similar to personal
				goals although they treat them only as soft goals (nonfunctional
				requirements) whereas we distinguish between the functional goal and quality in the levels of
				attainment. We have integrated advice from studies in
				human computer interaction where requirements-related
				issues of culture, localisation and context-aware systems
				have received considerable study. However, further
				work is required to explore the implications of context
				requirements in different types of mobile and contextaware applications. For instance, mobile applications
				with safety and security NFRs will require more high
				fidelity monitoring, and the nature of adaptation will be
				more challenging compared with notifier systems for
				general business tasks. The implications of requirements
				on system architecture has only started to be explored in
				security [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"43">43<span>]. The PC-RE framework and method draws
				attention to the need to analyse latent requirements for
				monitoring processes, interpreters and design for adaptation.
				As requirements are increasingly seen to be deferred over time or mutable over space, architectural
				design will become a foreground requirements concern,
				to specify context-aware and adaptable systems. Architectural trade-offs will need to be assessed to judge the
				mix of adaptable components (e.g. changed at design
				time) versus adaptable systems [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"19">19<span>] in which the change
				process is automated with monitors and interpreters
				executing adaptations. Another debate is between system initiative leaving the user in control of adaptation,
				or a combination in mixed initiative systems [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"20">20<span>].
			</p>

			<p class="indent">
				The scenario-based approach in PC-RE extends
				methods such as ScenIC [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"14">14<span>] in which obstacles are
				posited in the system environment as a stimulus for
				validating requirements. By varying scenarios over time
				and space, new obstacles and challenges can be identified. More
				formal reasoning could be applied to temporary deferment requirements, and our work with the
				KAOS method [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"34">34<span>] has taken some initial steps in this
				direction by exploring specification with temporal
				operators: always, in the future, unless, eventually, etc.
				However, formal reasoning over space and time is more
				complex due to the state-space explosion when multiple
				spatial contexts need to be considered, so formalisation
				of such requirements may not be productive.
			</p>

			<p class="indent">
				Our technique augments trade-offs between NFRs
				using decision table-style representation by specifically
				considering costs imposed on users and other stakeholders, which can then be integrated into more general
				NFR trade-offs. It also focuses on the evolution of
				requirements where personal goals tend to be shorter
				term than generic requirements and user characteristics,
				although in some cases personal goals may take a long
				time to achieve. Setting attainment levels for personal
				goals was prompted by the GQM framework [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"44">44<span>], although we have extended the metrics to include
				assumptions necessary for level of attainment. These
				dependencies could be further formalised in goal-oriented

			<p>
				modelling methods such as KAOS [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"34">34<span>].
				Another contribution of the trade-off analysis proposed in PC-RE is
				explicit consideration of socio-technical solutions, which
				challenges the notion that software automation is the
				default answer to a problem. PC-RE therefore reinforces
				the systems view of requirements [<span class="cite-use" data-ref"43">43<span>].
			</p>

			<p class="indent">
				In conclusion, personal and contextual requirements
				engineering has extended RE methods to account for the
				individual user and the context in mobile communication and global user interfaces. In many applications
				where the computer’s role is to influence the user’s
				behaviour and knowledge (e.g. training, education,
				augmented communication, mediating collaboration,
				games, entertainment, environmental control), personal
				goals and user characteristics will assume considerable
				importance. The application of our approach in the field
				of assistive technology has produced not only more detailed
				and better structured requirements but also insights into software and socio-technical systems design,
				which need to be resolved early in the requirements
				process. However, this work is a first step towards
				development of a more widely applicable method, so our
				next step is to test its generality in other domains, such
				as educational and home applications.
