				<p class="firstpagebody1 _10one">
					s students move from writing 
					personal essays to writing formal academic texts in English, they face several new challenges. 
					Writing tasks in higher education 
					often require students to draw upon 
					outside sources and to adopt the styles 
					and genres of academic discourse. 
					They must conduct research, summarize and paraphrase, cite sources, adopt 
					genre conventions that meet audience 
					expectations, and select words and 
					grammatical patterns that are characteristic of less personal and more 
					formal genres of writing.
				</p>

				<p class="firstpagebody2 _10one">
					These academic literacy skills can 
					pose challenges when first introduced. 
					To conduct research, students must 
					learn to search for and evaluate sources in terms of credibility and reliability, developing
					skills of informational 
					literacy (Tardy and Courtney 2008). 
					Once they have located sources, students need to learn to paraphrase and 
					summarize—skills that tend to be 
					more difficult in a second language 
					(L2). And students must learn to 
					avoid plagiarism. The issue of plagiarism has gained significant attention 
					among L2 writing teachers, who have 
					noted its complexity as it relates to 
					students’ linguistic resources (Keck 
					2006), task demands (Currie 1998), 
					and educational and sociocultural 
					backgrounds regarding the use and 
					re-use of words and ideas (Pecorari 
					2003; Pennycook 1996).
				</p>

				<p class="firstpagebody2 _10one">
					Academic settings also place 
					demands on students’ genre repertoires. Academic genres may be less 
					flexible than personal or expressive 
					genres. Indeed, academic writing has 
					been described as requiring students 
					“to speak as we do, to try on the 
					peculiar ways of knowing, selecting, 
					evaluating, reporting, concluding, 
					and arguing that define the discourse 
					of our community” (Bartholomae 
					1985, 134). Johns (1997) has argued 
					that classrooms can become crucial 
					sites for helping students develop this 
					complex knowledge of genres and 
					socioliterate practices. Teachers can 
					help students to uncover the ways in

				which genre forms are connected to readers and writers and their socially preferred 
				practices.
			</p>
				
			<p class="bodytext">
				An additional challenge faced in academic 
				writing is the issue of expertise. Academic 
				writing often requires students to write from 
				an expert position, even when they do not 
				consider themselves to be experts on their 
				topics. Carrying out complicated research in 
				a second language may exacerbate the issue of 
				expertise if students feel uncertain about their 
				L2 research skills as well as their L2 writing 
				skills. Encouraging students to draw on their 
				multiple linguistic resources in such tasks can 
				position them as multilingual and transnational writers who have valuable insight to 
				share with English-language readers, while 
				helping them to develop valuable biliteracy 
				skills (Gentil 2005).

				This article describes an approach to intro-ducing the skills of academic writing for L2 
				writers through the process of composing an 
				article for the web-based encyclopedia site 
				Wikipedia (<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">www.wikipedia.org</a>). After providing a description of Wikipedia, the article 
				outlines stages for carrying out a Wikipedia 
				research project. The assignment described 
				here can be easily scaled to a range of contexts and levels but may be best suited for 
				undergraduate-level writing students.

				<h2>What is Wikipedia?</h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					The term wikirefers to a collaborative 
					web-based space that can be modified by 
					any user. One of the most well-known wikis 
					is Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia that 
					includes 262 different language editions and 
					over 12 million articles. Launched in 2001, 
					Wikipedia has become a popular reference 
					source for general information on a wide 
					range of topics. Articles in Wikipedia range 
					in length from one or two sentences to more 
					than 10,000 words. The Wikipedia website 
					describes the collaborative composing process 
					as follows: 
				</p>

				<p class="journal">
					Visitors do not need specialized qualifications to contribute. Wikipedia's 
					intent is to have articles that cover 
					existing knowledge, not create new 
					knowledge (original research). This 
					means that people of all ages and cultural and social backgrounds can write 
					Wikipedia articles. Most of the articles 
					can be edited by anyone with access to 
					the Internet…. Anyone is welcome to 
					add information, cross-references, or 
					citations, as long as they do so within 
					Wikipedia’s editing policies and to 
					an appropriate standard. (Wikipedia 
					2009a)
				</p>

				<p class="boydtext">
					While the website has over 75,000 active contributors, it also has more than 1,000 Wikipedia
					administrators who can protect articles 
					(making them inaccessible to users) and block 
					individual users from editing articles.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Despite Wikipedia’s popularity with the 
					general public, the site has received a somewhat negative reputation in certain academic
					circles, where instructors often criticize 
					students who use Wikipedia as a primary 
					research source or even incorporate large 
					amounts of Wikipedia text into their own 
					writing. Though instructors may bemoan 
					Wikipedia, it is difficult to deny the usefulness of the site as a general reference. 
					Even more importantly, Wikipedia offers an 
					excellent forum for students to begin confronting the challenges of academic writing: 
					research, citation, generic conventions, and 
					style. Acquainting students with Wikipedia 
					and its procedures for content creation and 
					editing has the additional benefit of raising 
					their awareness about the credibility and reliability of information that they may locate as 
					Wikipedia users.

				<h2>Writing for Wikipedia</h2>

				<p><strong>Assignment overview</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					In the assignment described here, students 
					compose their own Wikipedia articles with 
					the goal of publishing them on the website, 
					making the articles available to a worldwide 
					audience. Students living in non-English-dominant countries have the advantage of 
					identifying and publishing on intriguing topics that are not covered in Wikipedia’s English 
					edition; the assignment therefore allows them 
					to draw on their personal interests, knowledge, and experiences as they write for an 
					audience that may know little about their 
					chosen topic. My own students have written 
					on topics such as a South Korean amusement 
					park, a Taiwanese celebrity, a Ukrainian opera 
					singer, an American romance novel author, 
					and the “spring pancake”—a popular food 
					from Beijing.

				</div>

<!-- Page 14 -->

				<p class="bodytext">
					To satisfy Wikipedia’s expectation that 
					information be supported by reliable sources, 
					students must research their topics. In doing 
					so, they will need to locate print or online 
					sources and evaluate the credibility of those 
					sources. The assignment also allows students 
					to draw on their own multilingual skills, as 
					their sources may be written in English or 
					other languages. Wikipedia guidelines require 
					that information in the articles be supported 
					by footnotes and general references, which 
					requires students to engage in correct citation practices. The assignment therefore can 
					function as an effective introduction to many 
					conventions of research writing.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					While the length of actual Wikipedia 
					articles varies greatly, classroom assignments 
					might best be limited to 400 to 1,000 words, 
					depending on the depth that instructors 
					would like students to go into. A text of 
					around 500 words works well for a general 
					introduction to the kinds of topics that students are likely to write about. Publication to 
					the website can be a required component of 
					the assignment, or it could be an optional step 
					for extra credit. A sample assignment description is provided in Appendix 1.
				</p>

				<h2><strong>Step 1: Examining Wikipedia</strong></h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Before students write for Wikipedia, they 
					will need to develop a good understanding 
					of the website itself, including the general 
					guidelines for contributing, the range of topics covered, and the kind of information that 
					is commonly included in an article. It is useful 
					to begin by finding out what students currently know about Wikipedia and how they 
					use the site. Students will often share what 
					they have heard about Wikipedia from other 
					teachers—for example, many of my students 
					had been told by their teachers not to use 
					Wikipedia. These kinds of reactions provide 
					valuable contributions to class discussions 
					about the credibility of sources in research 
					writing and about the contexts in which 
					Wikipedia may be most appropriately used. 
					During such discussions, it may also become 
					apparent that some students are unaware that 
					Wikipedia’s content is user-generated and that 
					anyone may contribute (a primary reason why 
					many college instructors discourage its use in 
					academic settings). Teachers with access to 
					computers in the classroom can demonstrate 
					how an article may be easily edited by clicking on the “edit this page” tab at the top of 
					the page; in the absence of computer access, 
					a screen-print of a Wikipedia article can also 
					highlight this tool. Students are often surprised to see that content in a major website 
					can be so easily modified. 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					After discussing the basic concept of Wikipedia as a collaborative global encyclopedia, 
					students can begin to look at the actual 
					content of the articles. To draw on their own 
					experiences, ask students to print out two 
					or three articles of interest to them to bring 
					to the next class session; while at least some 
					of these articles should be taken from the 
					English edition, some could also be published 
					in the students’ other languages. Begin the 
					next class by listing the titles of their selected 
					articles on the board and then ask students 
					to group the different topics into categories—they are likely to note categories such as 
					people, events, products, objects, geographic 
					locations, and so on. In smaller groups, students can then begin to analyze examples of 
					articles within one or two of these categories, 
					using the printed samples brought to class. 
					For instance, one group of students can analyze the sample articles that describe people, 
					while another group can analyze articles that 
					describe events. Provide a set of questions to 
					guide student analysis. For example:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>What kind of information is included in the article?</li>

					<li>What kind of information is excluded?</li>

					<li>
						Using several sample articles in your 
						category, look for any patterns in the 
						organization of the articles. What information is typically included first? Next? 
						If there are headings in the articles, 
						do you notice any that are commonly 
						used?
					</li>

					<li>
						How much background knowledge of 
						the topic do readers need to understand 
						the article?
					</li>

					<li>Is any specialized language or jargon used? If so, is it defined?</li>

					<li>What kind of information includes a footnote?</li>
				</ul>
					
				<p>
					Drawing on principles of genre-based pedagogy (Hyland 2007), questions like these help 
					students notice genre-based patterns among 
					entries. Their analysis can also lead to larger 
					class discussions of the role between the purpose of an encyclopedia article (especially an
				</p>

				<p>
					online one like Wikipedia) and the language 
					and content used in the article.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					It may be useful at this stage to discuss 
					with students some of the differences between 
					academic writing and Wikipedia writing. For 
					example, Wikipedia writing values concise, 
					jargon-free prose appropriate for a general 
					audience, while some academic writing is 
					characterized by complex sentences, detailed 
					support, references to academic texts, and 
					technical terminology. In addition, while 
					Wikipedia summarizes existing knowledge, 
					much academic writing aims to create new 
					knowledge.
				</p>

				<h2><strong>Step 2: Gathering information</strong></h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					After students have gained some famil-iarity with Wikipedia and its conventional 
					forms, they can begin to identify potential 
					topics for their own articles. As stated earlier, 
					a good guideline in selecting a topic is to iden-tify something that does not currently exist in 
					the English edition and that can be researched 
					through credible online or print sources. Stu-dents and teachers may also want to refer to 
					Wikipedia’s guidelines for creating content, 
					such as the site’s articles “What Wikipedia is 
					Not” and “No Original Research,” both of 
					which lay out restrictions to original or prima-ry research or biased points of view on an issue 
					(Wikipedia 2009a). Class brainstorming can 
					be a useful way to begin identifying topics.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Once students have selected a topic, they 
					are ready to start their research. The Fact 
					Sheet Assignment in Appendix 2 can help 
					students compile facts about their topic while 
					maintaining a record of the sources of infor-mation. They may find that some information 
					is found in multiple sources; at this stage, it is 
					useful for students to include all sources from 
					which they located the same content as well as 
					any contradictions between or among sources. 
					To simplify this process, they might assign let-ters (or shorthand “tags”) to each source, such 
					as a, b, c, etc. (see the example in Appendix 2). 
					Encourage students to collect more informa-tion than they may later need when writing 
					their actual articles.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					During this fact-finding stage, it is also 
					useful to introduce the issue of source reliabil-ity. Wikipedia provides its own guidelines on 
					reliability, but instructors may wish to address 
					the topic more broadly to prepare students 
					for future research projects. For instance, 
					students can rank the reliability of possible 
					sources, ranging from blogs to newspapers 
					to published books. They can also examine 
					information from specific websites, includ-ing personal sites, corporate-sponsored sites, 
					and non-profit organization sites, looking for 
					whether and how information is documented 
					or referenced, and considering the role that 
					bias may play.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					As students begin compiling facts through 
					their research, they may want to paraphrase 
					the information as they enter it into their Fact 
					Sheet. However, at this stage, they could sim-ply copy the exact words of the original text, 
					indicating all copied passages through the use 
					of quotation marks.
				</p>

				<h2><strong>Step 3: Outlining and paraphrasing</strong></h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Once students have compiled facts for 
					their article, they are ready to begin planning 
					the organization and content. At this point, 
					it can be useful for students to look back 
					at other Wikipedia articles again, especially 
					those written on similar types of topics. Using 
					the conventions of organization identified 
					from other articles, students will now create 
					an outline for their own article. Encourage 
					them to create detailed outlines that include 
					the sources (or corresponding letters of each 
					source, assigned in the previous stage) in 
					parentheses, as in the sample outline in Fig-ure 1. The more specific the outline is at this 
					stage, the easier it will be for students to move 
					into the drafting stage.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					As students create outlines of their con-tent, they should paraphrase any text that they 
					have kept from the original source. At this 
					stage, they do not need to write full sentences; 
					they can simply use phrases or fragments that 
					capture the main content without retaining 
					the structure and wording of the original text.
				</p>

				<h2><strong>Step 4: Drafting</strong></h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					At this point in the process, students 
					should have all of the necessary content for 
					their article and a good plan for organizing 
					that content. In addition, all of their content 
					should include lettered tags (a, b, c, etc.) that 
					correspond to the sources from which the 
					content was taken. Students who created a 
					detailed outline in Step 3 will likely have little 
					difficulty moving to the drafting stage. Now 
					they can focus their attention on the creation 
					of clear and coherent text. Any remaining

				</div>

<!-- Page 16 -->

				<p>
					quotations from the original sources should be 
					fully paraphrased or summarized at this stage. 
					As they draft, students may find it useful to 
					examine where quotations are used within 
					other Wikipedia articles; in most cases, they 
					will find that quotations are quite rare in this 
					genre, limited to the words of others (usually 
					well-known figures) about the article topic.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					As they compose the first draft, students 
					should continue to include a parenthetical ref-erence to their sources using the lettered tags 
					from their Fact Sheet, as illustrated in Figure 
					2. These letters will be deleted or converted 
					to footnotes later on, but at this stage they 
					will help to keep all of the research tied to its 
					original source.

<!-- Page 17 -->

				<h2><strong>Step 5: Revising</strong></h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Once students have completed a draft 
					of their article, with all sources informally 
					integrated into the text, they are ready to 
					turn their attention to revision. Through peer 
					review, students can receive feedback on their 
					drafts using questions such as: 
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Is the article complete? Does it answer 
						basic factual questions about the topic? 
						Are any important questions left unanswered?
					</li>

					<li>Is the organization easy to follow? Are headings used where appropriate?</li>

					<li>Is the writing clear and readable for a general audience?</li>
				</ul>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Other readers’ perspectives are very valuable 
					for the writer at this stage. Students who have 
					used Wikipedia before (in any language) generally have little difficulty reading these texts 
					and providing appropriate feedback. Even 
					students who are unfamiliar with Wikipedia 
					have probably read other general references 
					or encyclopedias and should be encouraged to 
					read their peers’ texts from that perspective.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					After students have received feedback on 
					content and clarity, and perhaps made necessary revisions, they can turn their attention to 
					the issue of style. In its guide to “Writing Better Articles,” Wikipedia describes its preferred 
					styles as “news style” or “summary style,” both 
					of which adopt a tone that is “formal, impersonal, and dispassionate” (Wikipedia 2009c). 
					While the website describes some lexico-grammatical features of this tone (e.g., no 
					use of first person “I” or “we,” gender-neutral 
					pronouns, and very limited use of jargon or 
					specialized language), students themselves can 
					analyze the language of published Wikipedia 
					articles and practice rewriting non-neutral 
					passages to conform to the preferred conventions. Next, students can look back at their 
					own drafts and identify any wording that 
					may introduce bias or any language that may 
					not otherwise conform to Wikipedia’s style 
					expectations.
				</p>

				<h2><strong>Step 6: Formatting sources</strong></h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Once students have revised their drafts 
					for content, organization, and style, they 
					are ready to tackle the issue of citation. As 
					a general reference text, a Wikipedia article 
					may not include as many citations as a more 
					specialized academic text. The website stipulates that sources should be cited (1) when 
					writing about an opinion or interpretation 
					that will probably be challenged, or that may 
					be considered controversial, (2) when writing 
					about a living person, (3) when quoting from 
					published materials, and (4) when adding an 
					image (Wikipedia 2009b).
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					According to Wikipedia, article sources 
					can be cited in two different formats: (1) foot-notes are used to tie a source directly to a
					specific piece of information in the article, and 
					(2) general referencesare used for sources that 
					support “a significant amount of the material 
					in the article” (Wikipedia 2009b).
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					It may be easiest to begin by focusing on 
					formatting the full citations that appear at the 
					end of the article (either as footnotes or general references). When writing for Wikipedia, 
					authors can use Wikipedia’s documentation 
					style, or they can use another style such as 
					MLA or Chicago. After students have been 
					introduced to a specific style and the use of a 
					style manual, they can create full citations for 
					each of the sources in their Wikipedia article.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The next step is for students to create 
					in-text citations in the form of footnotes, 
					where necessary. At this point, they should 
					go through each temporary lettered tag in 
					their article (the bracketed letter that corresponds to each original source) and determine 
					whether or not a footnote is necessary. Again, 
					information that needs to be tied directly to a 
					single source should include a footnote, while 
					information that is more general and can be 
					found in multiple sources does not require a 
					footnote and can be listed as a general reference. For many students, the system of
					numbering footnotes chronologically (in the order 
					in which they appear: [1] being first, [2] next, 
					and so on) may be new, so this step is best 
					demonstrated through an example.
				</p>

				<h2><strong>Step 7: Polishing</strong></h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Once students have cited their sources 
					properly, they are ready for final proofreading 
					and polishing. They should carefully read their 
					texts, paying attention to spelling, vocabulary, 
					grammar, and punctuation. Finally, students 
					can read through their articles to identify any 
					words or phrases that should be hyperlinked
					to other existing Wikipedia articles. These 
					hyperlinks, also called wikilinks, allow readers 
					to click on the word or words marked in blue 
					to access other articles and information. Geo-

					and terminology are common examples of 
					wikilinks, and are represented by the underlined words in Figure 3.
				</p>

				<h2><strong>Step 8: Publishing</strong></h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Both process-based and genre-based 
					approaches to writing instruction advocate 
					that students publish their writing for an audience beyond the teacher. Wikipedia provides 
					an excellent opportunity to publish for a global 
					audience. Students may initially be intimidated by the prospect of submitting their work for 
					worldwide publication, but the process itself is 
					fairly straightforward and is explained in detail 
					on the website. After registering as Wikipedia 
					users, students can publish their articles in just 
					a few steps. While articles are published immediately, some are quickly flagged for problems 
					(such as missing references or insufficient 
					content) and authors are asked by Wikipedia 
					editors to make further revisions. One of my 
					students described the value of this revision 
					process in a reflective essay:

					After two times of failing to pub-lish, my article was finally accepted 
					by the website. During these revis-ing sessions, my skills of audience 
					awareness, analysis, support, writing 
					processes and conventional forms were 
					reviewed again and again, and my 
					paper was also polished again and 
					again to meet the needs of the website. 
					That’s why I think the Wikipedia entry 
					is the project that can truly provoke 
					one’s potential in writing. Besides, my 
					friends in China also encouraged me 
					by their simple one-word response—
					“What?”—expressing how surprised 
					they were when I asked them to check 
					out my article on Wikipedia. Now, I 
					still enjoy searching my entry, Spring 
					Pancake, on the Wikipedia website.

					This student’s experience mirrored his

					and confidence that they gained in seeing 
					their English-language writing legitimized 
					through publication in this worldwide forum. 
					Students must also be aware that once their 
					article is published, any reader may add, 
					revise, or delete content. In fact, watching 
					their article evolve over time can be an excellent learning experience.

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					While academic writing poses numerous 
					challenges to L2 writers, students can begin to 
					develop academic literacy skills through small-scale research projects. The Wikipedia-writing 
					project described here introduces students to 
					many skills of academic research writing in a 
					manageable and interesting way. While the 
					assignment may be best suited to undergraduate or graduate-level writing, even secondary 
					students could engage with stages of the 
					assignment, perhaps contributing to existing 
					Wikipedia articles rather than producing their 
					own original articles. Students can explore 
					topics that interest them, while drawing on 
					their multilingual resources and cultural experiences to write from a knowledgeable
					position. In producing a text for Wikipedia, stu-dents gain a real sense of audience and enjoy 
					the satisfaction of seeing their work published 
					on a high-traffic global website.

					<p>Writing for the World: Wikipedia… • Christine M. Tardy</p>
				</div>

				<p>Assignment</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					For this assignment, choose a concept, person, place, or event to describe in a Wikipedia
					article. One stipulation: you must choose to write about something that currently 
					does not appear in the English-language version of Wikipedia. Use your global knowledge 
					(of your hometown or country, cultures, and languages) to identify a topic that is not in 
					the English edition of Wikipedia but that may be of interest to general English-language 
					readers. Your article should follow the typical style and tone of Wikipedia articles, be well 
					researched, and include citations where needed. You must also include Wikilinks (hyper-links to other
					Wikipedia entries) within your text where appropriate.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					We will analyze Wikipedia and the various conventions of its articles in class to help 
					prepare you for this assignment. The assignment will also help you to develop several 
					important writing skills, including audience awareness, use of evidence and support,
					citation conventions, and style.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Length</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Some Wikipedia articles are very long (for example, “Chicago”), while others are very 
					short. Yours should be 350 to 500 words in length.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Topics</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					As described above, <em>any</em> topic is acceptable as long as it meets Wikipedia’s guidelines 
					for contributions and does not currently exist in Wikipedia’s English edition. You may 
					find your broad knowledge of popular culture, countries, and languages to be helpful in 
					selecting a topic. Some possibilities might be: the neighborhood you grew up in, a famous 
					singer or celebrity from your country, a food item or dish, a movie or book, an author, an 
					historical event, a well-known newspaper or TV show in another country, or an influential 
					rganization you are familiar with. But do not limit yourself to these!
