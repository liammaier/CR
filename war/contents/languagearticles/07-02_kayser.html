					ANY RESEARCHERS AND ELT PRACTITIONERS HAVE NOTED THE VALUE OF PROJECT <br />
					work in English language teaching. Characterized by student collaboration on
					concrete outcomes, project work has a number of benefits including purposeful
					language use and increased student involvement and responsibility (Sheppard
					and Stoller 1995). Project work can also add extra motivation for students
					because it offers them the opportunity to use their language skills in a new and
					challenging way (Fried-Booth 1986).
				</p>

				<p class="firstpagebody2">
					Educational technology, which is increasingly being used in ELT programs
					around the world, has immense potential for enhancing project work. Project-based
					computer assisted language learning (PBCALL) can be a powerful tool for
					language teachers because it combines the benefits of project work with new
					technologies. This article describes a course that was designed to train students
					in Web design and guide them in the production of an electronic project. It also
					addresses some of the benefits and difficulties of teaching such a course.

				<h2>Project work and PBCALL</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					In PBCALL, students use technology to
					create meaningful projects that can be shared
					with worldwide audiences (Debski and Gruba
					1999). For example, students from a variety of
					locales might produce Web pages by collaborating with other students electronically. Like
					traditional project work, PBCALL gives students more responsibility and control of their
					learning because they are able to select, plan,
					and create a project of their own choice (Fried-Booth 1986). 
				</p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Although there are many similarities
					between PBCALL and traditional project
					work, Warschauer (2000) notes that while
					using technology, students have higher expectations in terms of their
					participation and control over the activity. Consequently, when students
					are assigned electronic projects without
					a perceived meaningful purpose, they are less
					motivated and may not take the task seriously.
					He argues that for electronic learning activities
					to be most purposeful and effective, they
					should be learner centered, based on authentic
					communication, and connected to larger
					goals, such as developing academic skills or
					providing a service to an organization.

				<h2>Course description</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Context.The course described in this article
					was developed for female native Arabic speakers
					at a Middle Eastern university, where the language of instruction is English.
					In the university’s intensive pre-academic English program,
					students receive between 15 and 20 hours of
					English instruction per week. Designed to
					improve their language proficiency, the majority of the courses are skills-based and
					focus on
					English for academic purposes. Other instruction includes content- and project-based
					courses, which students take as electives. In addition
					to their English courses, students receive information technology instruction, where they
					learn the basics of computer operation. They
					are also introduced to applications such as
					Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. All students
					and teachers have their own locally and globally networked laptop computers, and teachers
					are expected to integrate technology into all
					aspects of the curriculum.
				</p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					I designed a nine-week course that met for
					three hours per week and had two main objectives. First, it aimed to teach students how to
					create a basic Web page that included text,
					images, and photographs. Second, it provided
					students with the opportunity to complete a
					Web project of their choice. The project needed to serve a practical purpose for the
					university, and it required students to do some
					research in order to gather information. I
					taught this course to two different groups of
					students, a class of 18 and a class of 12.
				</p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Syllabus and activities. The syllabus contained three main parts. During the first three
					weeks, students were taught the basics of Web
					design using Microsoft Front Page. In weeks
					four through six, students planned and gathered information for their project. During the
					last three weeks of the course students drafted,
					revised, and produced their final Web pages.
					Below, I outline the activities that were performed on a week-by-week basis.
				</p>

				<h3>Week 1</h3>

				<p class="bodytext">
					<strong>Course Introduction and Web Page Evaluation.</strong> The first week focused on viewing
					different Web pages and analyzing them in terms
					of content, organization, design, and audience.
					For the first class, I showed my personal home-page, which served the dual function of
					introducing myself as well as explaining the nature
					of the course. I also showed them a Web project students had completed during the previous
					term. While viewing both pages, students
					were asked to consider the following questions:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>What is the Web page about?</li>
					
					<li>What kind of information does the Web site supply?</li>
					
					<li>What is the purpose of the Web page?</li>
					
					<li>What is the audience for the Web page?</li>

					<li>What do you think of the Web page design? </li>
					
					<li>What is your overall opinion of the Web page?</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Focusing on the questions above, during
					the second class students worked in pairs to
					evaluate Web pages made by students at different universities (see Appendix 1). In short,
					the first week’s activities introduced students
					to possible projects and allowed them to analyze features of a Web page.
				</p>

				<h3>Week 2 and 3</h3>

				<p class="bodytext">
					<strong>Basic Web Training.</strong> In week two, I focused
					on teaching the following skills: creating and
					saving Microsoft Front Page documents, man-

					aging files, using different text options such as
					bold and italics, changing background color,
					and inserting pictures and graphics. These
					lessons began with a demonstration of a certain procedure, which was projected to a
					whiteboard from my computer. For example,
					students watched me create a document, and
					then they repeated this procedure on their own
					computers. For their classroom assignment,
					students created three simple practice pages.
				</p>

				<p>
					In week three, I taught students how to
					insert tables and use them to organize images.
					In addition, I demonstrated how to link pages
					together, insert hyperlinks from the Internet,
					and copy pictures and backgrounds from the
					Web. This week’s assignment included students
					linking their three practice pages together and inserting hyperlinks to their favorite
					Internet sites.
				</p>

				<h3>Week 4</h3>

				<p>
					<strong>Defining and Planning Their Projects.</strong>
					After mastering the basics of Web design, students were ready to define the scope of their
					project. Once they had selected an appropriate
					topic and formed groups, they worked on a
					proposal for their project (see Appendix 2). To
					complete the proposal, they needed to consider the purpose
					of their project, their audience,
					and how they would organize their Web pages.
					The proposal also encouraged students to
					focus on the various tasks involved in the project and identify
					the steps needed to complete
					these tasks. For example, would they need to
					interview teachers, do research on the Internet, or make a visit off the campus? During
					the planning stage, students assigned roles to
					different group members and completed
					Action Plan 1 (see Appendix 3). They listed
					the tasks that needed to be done, the group
					member responsible for completing the task,
					and the amount of time needed for each task.
				</p>

				<h3>Weeks 5 and 6</h3>

				<p>
					<strong>Gathering Information and Researching.</strong>
					In week five, students gathered information
					for their project. Many groups interviewed
					teachers and students or conducted short
					questionnaires. Others searched for information on the
					Internet and in the library. At this
					point, the class became very student-directed
					and -centered. Students had their action plans,
					so they knew what they needed to accomplish
					in each class. Instead of fronting the class, my
					role became more of a mentor or consultant to
					the different groups. Fried-Booth (1986)
					describes the typical role of a teacher in project
					work as that of co-coordinator.
				</p>

				<h3>Week 7</h3>

				<p>
					<strong>Drafting.</strong> Before they began drafting their
					pages, students needed to work as a cooperative
					team to complete Action Plan 2 (see Appendix
					3), which focused on writing and designing the
					Web pages. During this process, they assigned
					different tasks to each group member based on
					her interests and skills. For example, some
					groups gave each member a different page to
					draft. Other groups divided the work between
					designing the pages and paraphrasing information found on the Internet.
				</p>

				<h3>Weeks 8 and 9</h3>

				<p>
					<strong>Teacher Feedback and Revision.</strong>
					In week eight, the first draft of the project was due.
					Groups signed up for a feedback session, in
					which I gave them advice on content, design,
					organization, and navigation (see Appendix 4).
					As soon as I gave the group feedback, they were
					required to complete Action Plan 3 (see Appendix 3),
					which focused on revision. In the final
					week of class, students revised their projects.
				</p>

			</section> <!-- Section 2 -->

			<section class="subsection" data-number="3" data-name="Example Projects">

				<h2>Example Projects</h2>

				<p>
					Students’ projects varied in content, purpose, design, and organization. One project
					provided an academic service to other students; another one offered useful information
					to teachers and staff. One group of students
					produced a page meant to entertain their class-mates and other teenagers.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Research Course Resource Page.</strong>
					All students in the intensive English pre-academic
					program must take a course that requires they
					write a research paper. Because this course is
					difficult for most students, one group decided
					to make a resource page for the course as their
					Web project. They aimed to provide useful
					information and advice for students who
					would take this course in the future. Their
					project consisted of four pages: a homepage, a
					page that described the course content (syllabus and overview of the course), a page that
					included examples of student research projects, and a page that gave advice from students
					and teachers. To complete this project, students interviewed teachers who taught the
					course and other students who had taken the
					course. In addition, they gathered a sample
					syllabus, exemplary essays, and useful links.

				<p>
					<strong>City Web Guide.</strong>
					Two students made a Web
					page introducing their city to new foreign
					teachers and staff. Their project had many
					pages, including a brief history of the city, local
					shopping, and tourist attractions. To gather
					information and decide which aspects of the
					city to include, they made a short questionnaire
					for foreign teachers concerning their interests.
					They also searched extensively on the Net.
					Much of their drafting work consisted of selecting relevant information and paraphrasing. 
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Student Magazine.</strong>
					One group of 14 students chose to design a magazine called Miss
					Teen,which was intended to be a source of
					entertainment for fellow students and other
					women their age. Two students acted as Web-masters, designing the homepage and making
					sure that the other pages were consistent in
					design. The others worked either individually
					or in small groups to produce a section of the
					magazine, such as movies, fashion, health,
					Islam, pets, university news, and cooking. The
					majority of the group members obtained information from the Internet.
					Some also interviewed staff, faculty, and students.
				</p>

			</section> <!-- Section 3 -->

			<section class="subsection" data-number="4" data-name="Course Effectiveness">

				<h2>Cource effectiveness</h2>

				<p>
					At the end of the term, I interviewed 19
					students about their experiences while taking
					the course. From these interviews and from
					my own observations, I was able to draw tentative
					conclusions about the benefits and difficulties of
					implementing a PBCALL course. 
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Benefits.</strong> The fact that their projects had an
					authentic purpose motivated many students.
					Most of them strongly identified with their
					group’s purpose. When asked why they made
					the Web project, only one student stated that it
					was for the course. All of the others said they
					made it for their intended audience. This confirms Fried-Booth’s
					(1986) assertion that project work is motivating because students have a
					personal investment in it and they see tangible
					results. Students were also motivated by learning how to use technology more effectively.
					They valued this skill and believed it would
					help them in their future studies and careers.
				</p>

				<p>
					An unexpected benefit of the course was that
					many students went above and beyond my
					expectations. For example, many of the students
					mastered the technological aspects at a much
					faster pace than anticipated and were eager to
					learn more. An exceptionally bright student
					learned how to edit HTML code on her own;
					thus, she was able to include several extra features on her Web page.
					As the course progressed,
					on her own initiative, she taught several of the
					others in the class what she had learned. Students often went to her for advice.
					The possibility of students adopting the role of teacher
					in such a project-based technology course has
					previously been noted (Toyoda 2000).
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Difficulties.</strong> Ironically, one of the benefits
					also had drawbacks. Although mastering the
					technological aspects of the course was important, many students became sidetracked by
					design elements. Several became overly concerned with features, such as animation, and
					less concerned about the content of their
					pages. This resulted in impatience and resistance to spending their
					time on essential work,
					such as proofreading. Students also got bored
					with the action plans and wanted to spend all
					of their time designing their pages.
				</p>

				<p>
					Other difficulties arose because students’
					projects were too ambitious. While at the
					beginning of the course I was awed by student
					initiative and creativity in their project plans,
					in retrospect I see that they needed to have
					boundaries set for them. Many of the projects
					were simply too extensive and required more
					time than a nine-week course allowed.
					Although all of the students produced a solid
					first draft of their pages, most did not complete the final draft. Unfortunately, the last
					few weeks of the course coincided with exam
					week, which compounded the problem. As a
					result, many of the pages never went beyond
					draft form. For example, the sections of the
					Miss Teenmagazine were not all linked together and only a few pages were uploaded to
					the Internet.
				</p>

			</section> <!-- Section 4 -->

			<section class="subsection" data-number="5" data-name="Conclusions">

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>

				<p>
					Despite the drawbacks, this course provided students with an opportunity to be creative,
					take charge of their own learning, and produce
					something tangible. At the same time, it
					enabled them to develop information technology skills, which added value to their learning
					experiences. Courses like these are relatively
					new, so the exchange of teacher observations
					(Davey 2001; Toyoda 2000) and course
					descriptions is useful for practitioners and
					material developers.
