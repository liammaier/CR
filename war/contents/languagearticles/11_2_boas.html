					n contrast to the product 
					approach to writing, which is 
					based on studying and replicating 
					textual models, the process approach 
					involves multiple and repeated steps 
					that compel the writer to closely consider
					the topic, language, purpose for 
					writing, and social reality of an audience.
					Although there are variations 
					on how to use the process approach 
					in the writing classroom, most share 
					the basic principles of prewriting, 
					peer and teacher feedback, and revision
					(Ferris and Hedgcock 2005). 
					The process approach to writing is 
					advocated by researchers and educators
					who teach writing in the first lan-guage (Calkins 1994; Boscolo 2008) 
					as well as by English as a Second/
					Foreign Language (ESL/EFL) professionals
					(Grabe and Kaplan 1996; 
					Raimes 1998; Campbell 1998; Reid 
					2001; Liu and Hansen 2002; Nation 
					2009).
				</p>

				<p class="firstpagebody2 _11two">
					According to Ferris and Hedgcock 
					(2005, 8), “as a transactional activity, 
					writing represents a process that must 
					be undertaken with the reader’s background
					knowledge, needs, interests 
					and ideologies in mind.” The process 
					approach reflects the fact that writing 
					involves a relationship between the 
					writer and his or her audience that 
					produces an awareness of authentic 
					social situations and an affinity to 
					collaborate with others. Therefore, 
					the process approach fits in with the 
					socioconstructivistview of education 
					that suggests successful learning is 
					enhanced when it is based on the 
					needs, worldview, and sociocultural 
					background of the learner. In other 
					words, student-centered teaching that 
					makes learning relevant to students 
					and their social realities results in 
					greater interest, involvement, and 
					confidence in language learning. For 
					this reason, it is important to structure
					a writing curriculum around the 
					discourse genres that correspond to 
					those situations where students will 
					use English communicatively in their 
					personal, academic, and professional 
					endeavors (Reid 2001).

				Among the many strategies and tools to 
				incorporate meaningful activities into the 
				writing curriculum, the use of the Internet 
				stands out for its ability to create conditions 
				for idea generation, research, and collaboration,
				especially with teenage learners who are 
				accustomed to interacting online with social 
				media. Social networking that is targeted to 
				ESL/EFL writing instruction also offers great 
				potential to integrate the additional skills of 
				reading, speaking, and listening. Some examples
				of software that allows people to connect, 
				to communicate, and to collaborate online 
				are blogs, wikis, and podcasts (Dudeney and 
				Hockly 2007). These platforms are interactive 
				and multimodal by nature and place texts, 
				images, videos, and audio recording in one 
				location visited by a community of language 
				learners.

				<h2>The process approach to writing</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					A major goal of ESL/EFL writing pedagogy
					is to engage students in interactive and 
					social, rather than individual, processes of 
					planning, drafting, and revising texts of different
					genres that will serve authentic communicative
					purposes. According to numerous 
					second language researchers and educators, 
					ESL/EFL writing pedagogy should include 
					(1) a large amount of writing practice, (2) several
					varieties of texts and motivating tasks, 
					(3) opportunities for revision and feedback, 
					and (4)  models of acceptable texts (Grabe 
					and Kaplan 1996; Raimes 2002; Grabe 2001; 
					Kroll 2001; Reid 2001; Seow 2002; Sokolik 
					2003; Nation 2009).
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					According to Hedgcock (2005), the procedural
					aspects of writing instruction for students
					are often insufficient. In particular, the 
					writing assignments in textbooks published 
					by international publishers do not always 
					provide the information students need in 
					order to develop effective writing strategies. 
					Teachers should therefore plan their instruction
					to encompass all the stages of the writing
					process: brainstorming for ideas that are 
					related to students’ lives and about which they 
					will have something to say; pre-writing that 
					uses graphic organizers and outlines to show 
					students how to plan their writing; drafting, 
					revising, and asking for feedback through peer 
					review; and using assessment rubrics that are 
					shown to students before they produce their 
					texts to make expectations clear. Instructors 
					should always keep in mind that writers do 
					not perform these stages linearly, but rather 
					like in a pinball game (Campbell 1998), in 
					which the ball moves back and forth.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Modeling written genres</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					According to Hyland (2003), the identification
					of different writing genres with specific 
					social contexts complements process writing. 
					According to Bakhtin (1992), genres have 
					forms that are quite fixed, which indicates 
					that ESL/EFL students must receive explicit 
					instruction regarding the discourse genres or 
					types they will have to produce (Cope and 
					Kalantzis 1993). Therefore, the introduction 
					of written genres should include <em>scaffolding instruction</em>,
					which consists of strategies to 
					make the writing process more accessible, 
					especially for students who are learning the 
					skill for the first time. This is accomplished by 
					clarifying the purpose for writing, relating the 
					topic to the student’s interests, using graphics 
					to create a visual context, and establishing a 
					context for free expression and collaborative 
					peer review.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					It is also important to raise awareness by 
					exposing students to one or two model texts 
					so they begin to identify the rhetorical features 
					of different genres, such as persuasive, expository,
					and narrative texts. Instructors should 
					not assume that students will pick up rhetorical
					patterns and conventions incidentally, and 
					so they should be taught. One way to accomplish
					this is through the technique of noticing (Schmidt 1990), 
					which can be used to 
					stress linguistic aspects of a text by underlining,
					highlighting, or using another emphatic 
					method to ensure that students focus on and 
					learn the rhetorical features of a certain genre.

				<h2>Social use of the Internet</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The Internet can be used in a variety 
					of ways to support process writing as students
					develop their writing skills in various 
					genres. Although the Internet is a naturally 
					motivating tool and many young learners 
					are familiar with using information technology,
					it is important for teachers to be 
					active facilitators when the Internet is used 
					for language learning. Since the Internet 
					is multilingual, an obvious issue is how to 
					make sure that students use English for 
					their online tasks. In addition, teachers who 
					have never used blogs or social media for 
					the development of process writing might 
					feel lost about what steps to take to make 
					the activities interactive and motivating. 
					Fortunately, these instructors can consult 
					widely available and user-friendly online 
					resources to make the technology accessible. 
					For example, blogs and Ning networks are 
					two widely used online platforms that can 
					be easily researched and adapted to all stages 
					of the process approach.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Blogs</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					A blog (a blend of the words <em>web</em> and <em>log</em>) 
					is a web page with regular diary or journal 
					entries that incorporates different postings 
					by authors and responses to these posts by an 
					audience. According to Bloch (2008), blogs 
					are an ideal resource for the teaching of writing
					because they:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>are easy to create and maintain;</li>

					<li>encourage students to be more prolific writers;</li>

					<li>make writing easier to share;</li>

					<li>support group work, feedback, and collaboration;</li>

					<li>provide opportunities to write outside of class;</li>

					<li>can link to related texts and multimedia;</li>

					<li>provide students with a sense of authorship; and</li>

					<li>can be used in various ways by the instructor.</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Blogs are easy to set up and posts are simple
					to comment on. Two websites that support 
					the free creation of blogs are www.blogger.
					com and http://wordpress.com. (Richardson 
					[2006] is an excellent resource for teachers 
					who need help setting up and using blogs.)
				</p>

				<p><strong>Ning</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					An alternative to a blog is a group social 
					networking site such as Ning (www.ning.
					com). Ning provides more tools than a blog; 
					it is a place where smaller groups of users can 
					create their own profiles, upload videos and 
					photos, and write their own blogs. Originally, 
					Ning was free of charge, but now (after a free 
					trial) there is a small monthly fee for a site 
					with up to 150 members. A free alternative to 
					Ning is Grouply (www.grouply.com), which 
					offers social networking tools similar to those 
					provided by Ning.

			<section class="subsection" data-number="3" data-name="Two writing tasks using blogs and Ning">

				<h2>Two writing tasks using blogs and Ning</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Following are two writing tasks for separate
					genres that were carried out during a 
					semester with two groups of teenage students 
					in an advanced EFL course. Both tasks illustrate
					how to combine the process approach 
					to writing with the multimodal features of 
					Internet technology.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Writing task 1: Blogging an argumentative essay</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The first writing task uses a class blog in a 
					collaborative effort to compose a short argumentative
					essay.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 1: Topic selection</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The curricular guidelines of the course 
					required students to write a text in the 
					argumentative genre. It is well known that 
					Brazilians are great fans of soccer; therefore, 
					this sport topic was selected both for its motivational
					appeal and to quickly activate the 
					students’ abundant background knowledge of 
					the subject.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 2: Pre-writing activities</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					For purposes of developing a controversial 
					topic related to soccer, a blog was created with 
					the title “The Best Soccer Players and Their 
					Salaries.” The blog post contained links to 
					three additional Internet texts about the topic. 
					Pre-selecting the links enables the teacher to 
					monitor how students paraphrase the research. 
					Eventually, the teacher can encourage students 
					to search on their own for additional information;
					however, it is always important to teach 
					students to judge the authenticity and reliability
					of the material they find on the Internet.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Providing links to different articles is 
					important because <em>intertextuality</em> is associated

				<p>
					with the advancement of reading and writing 
					development (de Beaugrande 1997). This 
					principle asserts that the introduction of multiple
					texts related to an overall theme offers 
					different perspectives and deepens understanding.
					Therefore, students were required 
					to read the different texts to find out how 
					much the most popular soccer players currently
					earned. After reading, students received 
					a handout and worked in pairs to complete 
					the following activity: “Talk with your partner 
					about whether you think the most popular 
					soccer players door do notmake too much 
					money for what they do. Write “Yes” or “No” 
					below and then provide three pieces of evidence
					to support your point of view.” 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Student pairs used the school computer 
					lab to access the websites, discuss the question 
					with their partner, and post three pieces of 
					evidence on the blog to support their argument.
					This task required students to synthesize
					the ideas in the three linked texts and to 
					find evidence to back up their “Yes” or “No” 
					conclusion.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 3: Drafting an introductory paragraph</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					During the next class, students split into 
					pairs and received two handouts; the first 
					one contained the student-generated evidence 
					from the blog posts made in the computer lab 
					during the previous class, and the second one 
					was a description of various ways to structure 
					an argumentative text. The students were 
					asked to sort the arguments into two categories,
					depending on whether they agreed with 
					(PRO) or disagreed with (CON) the statement.
					At this point students were ready to 
					begin drafting an introductory paragraph for 
					their argumentative essay. 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					To help students write an essay, instructors 
					should provide guidelines on how to write 
					the introduction, the body of the paper, and 
					the conclusion. For example, the evidence of 
					an argumentative essay typically appears in 
					the body of the text, and students need concise
					information to understand the rhetorical 
					patterns of this particular genre. Helpful 
					instructional material about all types of genres 
					is available from the online writing centers
					of various educational institutions. This 
					information also makes the assignment more 
					authentic because students feel that they are 
					obtaining guidelines from the same sources 
					used by ESL students in the United States. 
					(It is suggested that only educational website 
					links with the “.edu” domain be used for this 
					step, due to their greater reliability.) Figure 1 
					contains the information that was posted on 
					the blog regarding (1) the development of the 
					introductory paragraph and (2) the structure 
					of an essay in the argumentative genre.
				</p>

				<div class="box">

						</li>
					</ol>
				</div>

				<p><strong>Figure 1. Internet sources that support the composition of an argumentative essay</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					At this point, students drafted their introductory
					paragraphs following the suggestions
					provided in Figure 1. These suggestions 
					included examples of how to use the introductory
					paragraph to establish a clear position 
					one way or the other, and to reserve the following
					paragraphs to offer evidence for their 
					argument and to refute the opposite claim.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 4: Peer review of the introductory paragraph</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					After composing their introductory 
					paragraphs, the students formed pairs and 
					exchanged papers for peer revision. Peer revision
					is a critical element in process-writing 
					pedagogy because it (1)  makes the writing 
					process interactive and collaborative (Liu and 
					Hansen 2002); (2) gives the writer a sense of 
					audience (White and Arndt 1991); (3) allows 
					feedback that is different from the teacher’s 
					(Campbell 1998); and (4)  orients students 
					to accept constructive criticism (Grabe and

				<p>
					Kaplan 1996). If enough computer resources 
					are available, students can post their introductory
					paragraphs, and peer review can take 
					place on the blog itself. However, because 
					my institution has one computer lab that is 
					shared by around twenty teachers, it was not 
					practical to monopolize the lab for two classes 
					in a row. Another alternative is to ask students 
					to give peer feedback at home, but this is not 
					always feasible if students do not have computers
					or if parents limit the number of hours 
					a day their teenagers can use them. Therefore, 
					students used the traditional “paper and pencil”
					mode to write their introductions and 
					exchange them for peer revision.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Effective peer review activities need to be 
					guided (Kroll 1991); therefore, the reviewer 
					was told to pay attention to two aspects:
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						Did the writer make it clear whether he 
						or she is agreeing or disagreeing with 
						the thesis that soccer players make too 
						much money?
					</li>
					
					<li>
						Did the writer refrain from presenting 
						his or her arguments in the introduction,
						the purpose of which is to introduce
						the topic and state the thesis?
					</li>
				</ol>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					This peer review activity made the students 
					much more aware of the role the introduction 
					plays in an argumentative essay and also raised 
					their awareness to the fact that introductory 
					paragraphs in English are more to-the-point 
					than in Portuguese, a romance language with 
					a more indirect rhetorical style.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 5: Drafting and revising the argumentative essay</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					After writing their introductory paragraphs 
					and obtaining feedback from their peers, students
					were now ready to write their argumentative
					essays. Students used the handouts and 
					the information that was posted on the blog 
					(see Figure 1) for guidance on how to pattern 
					their argumentative essays. This information 
					contains examples on how to defend a thesis, 
					and it illustrates three patterned formats to 
					support an opinion and refute opposing ideas 
					with concrete evidence, which could be facts, 
					statistics, or expert opinion. If time permits, a 
					draft of each student’s essay should undergo 
					the peer review process. This allows a partner 
					to assess the strength of the evidence and 
					refutation, and will help students produce convincing
					essays for the teacher, who will comment
					on and return them before the final draft 
					is produced for a grade. When the essays were 
					finished, they were posted on the class blog.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 6: Sharing written production</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					An aspect that jeopardizes writing assignments
					in schools is the fact that the students’ 
					audience is often only the teacher. Therefore, 
					as a way to provide more authenticity to this 
					writing task, a post-writing stage was added. 
					After students posted their essays on the blog, 
					they returned to the computer lab and each 
					student commented on his or her partner’s 
					essay. Because the drafting process had already 
					ended, the purpose of the comments was to 
					focus on the content of the essay, and not 
					the form. For example, peers commented on 
					whether they agreed or disagreed with the 
					point of view stated by the author. As students 
					become more familiar with peer revision, it 
					is appropriate to give feedback on both form 
					and content and make helpful suggestions 
					about how the writer could improve the text. 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					This writing activity can be easily adapted 
					to different cultural contexts and topics. For 
					example, in a country where basketball is more 
					popular than soccer, the focus can be on basketball
					players’ salaries; or, in a lesson on celebrities,
					the teacher might want to follow the 
					same procedure to help students develop an 
					argumentative text about movie stars’ salaries. 
				</p>

				<p><strong>Writing task 2: Using Ning to compose an expository paragraph</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The second writing task used Ning in a 
					collaborative effort to compose a short expository
					compare-and-contrast paragraph.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 1: Topic selection</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					For this lesson, students were required to 
					study a technology topic. The writing assignment
					proposed in the book was a paragraph 
					stating the advantages and disadvantages of 
					using RFID (radio frequency identification) 
					chips on people. Since this topic would likely 
					lead to boring paragraphs that were too similar,
					a decision was made to replace it with a 
					more stimulating and relevant topic on the 
					comparable advantages and disadvantages of 
					different types of smartphones.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 2: Pre-writing activity</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					For this class I created a Ning social network 
					website and used a discussion forum to post my 
					intention to upgrade from an old and outdated

					cell phone to the iPhone, the must-have gadget 
					at the time. I chose the iPhone because this 
					particular smartphone is very expensive in 
					Brazil, costing almost five times more than in 
					the United States. However, I could also have 
					chosen other types of expensive smartphones, 
					such as a BlackBerry or a sophisticated type of 
					Android phone, or asked the students to determine
					the most sought-after smartphone.
				</p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					As in the blog activity, I also linked to three 
					articles from different websites that discussed 
					advantages and disadvantages of iPhones so that 
					students could research the issue and develop 
					their own ideas about the benefits of purchasing
					this product as opposed to another smartphone
					model. Students worked in pairs in the 
					computer lab to do their research on the topic, 
					and were also allowed to expand their research 
					beyond the three websites provided. By the end 
					of the class, each pair posted three advantages 
					and three disadvantages of buying an iPhone 
					in the comments section of the Ning blog.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 3: Drafting the expository paragraph</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					During the next class we logged onto Ning 
					and students read all the comments from the 
					previous day. As a group, the class then agreed 
					on the three most frequently mentioned 
					advantages and disadvantages. Next, I elicited 
					the following topic sentence of an introductory
					paragraph from the students: “There are 
					many advantages and disadvantages to buying 
					an iPhone.” The whole class then considered 
					examples of cohesive devices from the textbook
					(“one advantage is,” “another benefit 
					is,” etc.) to describe the advantages of buying 
					an iPhone. For each advantage, I had the 
					students give a detailed explanation of why it 
					was an advantage. At the end of class the half-written
					paragraph looked like this:
				</p>

				<p class="journal">
					Buying an iPhone has advantages and 
					disadvantages. One advantage is the 
					touch screen because it is easier to 
					use than a regular cell phone and it is 
					more modern. Another benefit is that 
					it has a Wi-Fi connection. This is good 
					because you can log on to the Internet 
					faster and anywhere you want. In addition,
					the sound quality is superior to 
					that of other cell phones. However, 
					there are also disadvantages.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					For homework, which was worth extra 
					credit, students were asked to use the collaborative
					list of disadvantages to complete 
					the paragraph. Again, students received guidance
					about appropriate cohesive devices from 
					the textbook (“one drawback is,” “another 
					disadvantage is,” etc.). Five students who 
					completed the homework posted their work 
					on the Ning network.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 4: Collaborative review by whole class</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The following day the whole class analyzed 
					the five postings on the Ning network and 
					selected the most complete one: 
				</p>

				<p class="journal">
					However, the are some disadvantages. 
					Like one drawback is that, if some 
					day your telefone battery goes bad, 
					there’s no way to fix it, or change 
					it, soh you have to buy another one 
					(witch is another disadvantage because 
					one iPhone is expensive). And another 
					disadvantage is that there’s no wi-fi, 
					so you can’t send any photos and you 
					also don’t even have a camera. In my 
					opinion, you shouldn’t buy an iPhone, 
					because it just looks modern.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					In addition to providing the second half of 
					the expository paragraph, this activity was a 
					good opportunity to address errors, including 
					the issue of using language that is too informal 
					for writing, such as <em>like</em>; spelling issues, such 
					as <em>soh</em>; and incorrect word choices, such as (in 
					this example) <em>witch</em>. After correcting the text, 
					the two half-paragraphs were joined together 
					to create a complete paragraph on the advantages
					and disadvantages of the iPhone. 
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 5: Drafting and revising an expository paragraph</strong></p>

					For the next step, students worked in small 
					groups to come up with a list of other technological
					gadgets that were trendy at the time, 
					including the iPad, the Kindle, the iTouch, 
					netbooks, the Wii, and the Xbox, among 
					others. Students were instructed to choose 
					one gadget and write a paragraph about the 
					advantages and disadvantages of purchasing 
					it, just as they had done for the iPhone. After 
					writing their individual paragraphs, students 
					paired up and exchanged papers with their 
					partners, who followed a checklist to review

					also to comment on whether the advantages 
					or disadvantages were convincing enough

					both their partner and the teacher, then 
					handed in the final draft.

				<p><strong>Step 6: Publishing the expository paragraph</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					As a final step, students prepared to publish 
					their essays on the Ning network. However, 
					this time, the idea was to explore the multi-modal
					capabilities of social networking on the 
					Internet and have students share their ideas 
					online with a wider community. Teachers have 
					many options in this regard. One possibility
					is to initiate a <em>talkgroup</em> about a specific 
					topic and invite students to record and post 
					their opinions in an audio format. This can 
					be done with a free online voice recording 
					tool such as Voxopop (www.voxopop.com). 
					The only disadvantage is that Voxopop does 
					not allow images to accompany the audio 
					presentation. Another alternative is to create 
					a <em>slidecast</em>, which is a multimedia presentation 
					complete with sound and images that can 
					be established with a free Slideshare account 
					(www.slideshare.net). For example, students 
					could upload a PowerPoint presentation with 
					written details and images of the gadgets along 
					with an <em>MP3 podcast</em> that can be recorded by 
					using the open source voice recording software 
					Audacity, which can be downloaded for free at 
					http://audacity.sourceforge.net.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					When the students were asked to record 
					their texts, they were initially reluctant, saying 
					that they would be embarrassed to perform 
					a speaking activity for a wider audience. It 
					is not uncommon for students to be apprehensive
					about using their second language in 
					front of an audience, especially in unfamiliar 
					contexts. Even in the most prestigious private 
					schools in Brazil, teachers have just begun to 
					use computers and projectors, and have not 
					reached the stage where students are generating
					content online. To overcome the students’ 
					objection, I proposed that we produce the 
					recordings but not share them with anyone 
					outside the class, to which the students agreed. 
					Although publishing for a wider audience is 
					an optimal goal, the negotiated solution made 
					the exercise as meaningful as possible and also 
					indicated the need to continue with similar 
					projects until students acquire more experience
					and confidence. Students also respond to 
					incentives such as a prize or extra points for 
					the “greatest blog of the month” or “multimedia
					presentation of the year.”

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The activities described in this article exemplify
					how web-based social networking tools 
					offer excellent opportunities to conduct the 
					pre-writing, drafting, peer review, and revising
					steps of the writing process. In addition to 
					developing important writing and other skills 
					in English and learning to work collaboratively
					on projects, using the Internet for ESL/
					EFL instruction also advances students’ digital 
					literacy. When writing about topics that are 
					relevant to their needs and interests, students 
					are apt to respond enthusiastically and work 
					collaboratively to craft written work in the 
					types of genres that will benefit them in their 
					academic pursuits and subsequent careers.
