				<h1>Using Original Video and Sound Effects to Teach English</h1>

				<p class="firstletter _12one">C</p>

				<p class="firstpagebody1 _12one">
					reating specific lessons for 
					different language skills is 
					challenging and time consuming
					for English teachers, but it 
					is definitely worth the effort. In my 
					experience, teaching language skills 
					through mechanical exercises and 
					traditional fill-in-the-blank, true/
					false, and multiple-choice assessments
					does not interest students 
					as much as we expect. This fact 
					inspired me to consider lively, interesting,
					and meaningful contexts and 
					materials. Although the mechanical 
					exercises and supplementary materials
					in resource books are use-ful—and I use a variety of them 
					myself—they do not energize my 
					students. But when I go creative, 
					especially when teaching grammar, 
					in a way students do not expect, I 
					can clearly see the difference. This 
					article will suggest a motivating 
					way to teach grammar with audio-visual
					techniques, with an example 
					of a lesson on teaching modals of 
					speculation that express degrees of 
					certainty (e.g., <em>may</em>, <em>might</em>, <em>could</em>, 
					<em>couldn’t</em>).

					where the focus is on interesting content, 
					and radio can certainly provide interesting 
					content” (Bedjou, 2006, 28). Bedjou (2006) 
					introduces a number of English teaching 
					activities that can be organized around radio 
					programs, specifically VOA Special English 
					programs, and points out the significance 
					of radio as an English teaching tool: “Radio 
					can bring authentic content to the classroom, 
					especially in the EFL environment, where it 
					may not be easy to meet and talk with native 
					speakers of English” (28). Newspapers are 
					another authentic and readily available source

					relevance of newspapers make them good 
					teaching tools.

				<h2>Videos in the classroom</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Integrating videos into lessons creates 
					enticing visuals and a special interactive environment
					in the EFL/ESL classroom. Teaching 
					English through videos also allows teachers to 
					be creative when designing language lessons. 
					As Cundell (2008, 17) notes, “One of the 
					most powerful ways that video can be integrated
					into courses is for the visual representation
					they provide for learners on otherwise 
					abstract concepts.” This is the idea that compelled
					me to use a homemade video to teach 
					a one-hour “modals of speculation” lesson for 
					my intermediate students. Videos permitted 
					me to provide my students with audiovisual 
					stimuli to introduce these important modal 
					auxiliaries in a way that made sense to my 
					students.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Rather than search for a video online, I 
					chose to accept the challenge and make my 
					own short video for the lesson. An important 
					point is that I am not an expert in video 
					recording, but I do know how to use my 
					camcorder.

			<section class="subsection" data-number="3" data-name="Making the video">

				<h2>Making the video</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					To create the desired context to teach 
					modals of speculation, I produced a video 
					to create a speculative context. I first asked 
					someone to videotape me doing actions that 
					generated different sounds while I was getting
					ready to leave the house for work. These 
					scenes included:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>brushing my teeth with an electric toothbrush</li>

					<li>blow drying my hair</li>

					<li>ironing my clothes with steam</li>

					<li>using a whistling kettle to boil water</li>

					<li>pouring water into a cup</li>

					<li>toasting a piece of bread in the toaster</li>
					
					<li>leaving the tap dripping</li>
					
					<li>spraying air freshener</li>
					
					<li>leaving my cell phone ringing</li>
					
					<li>locking the door</li>
					
					<li>waiting for and entering an elevator</li>
					
					<li>turning on the ignition of the car</li>
				</ul>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					While I was doing all these actions, a 
					friend followed me and recorded everything. 
					Even if you do not have anyone to videotape 
					you, you can still make the video by carrying 
					the camera and filming yourself.

			<section class="subsection" data-number="4" data-name="Video transfer options">

				<h2>Video transfer options</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					If your class is equipped with a computer 
					and video projector, or you have access to a 
					computer lab, you can record the video using 
					a digital camera or even your mobile phone. 
					Then the only thing you need to do is to 
					insert the camera’s (or the mobile phone’s) 
					memory card into your laptop’s memory stick 
					slot, insert your USB into your laptop’s USB 
					slot, and transfer the video from the memory 
					card to the USB. You can even send the video 
					to your own email account as an attachment if 
					the file is not too big. After recording, I took 
					my camcorder to a local store and had the 
					video transferred to a VHS videotape format, 
					which was necessary because we depend on a 
					TV set and a video player to play the videos.

				<h2>Setting up the video lesson</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Harmer (2007, 310) suggests a variety of 
					viewing techniques when using films and videos
					in listening activities, including:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Silent viewing (playing the video with-out the sound)</li>

					<li>Freeze framing (freezing the picture and asking the students what they think will happen next)</li>

					<li>Partial viewing (covering most of the screen with a piece of paper)</li>

					<li>Picture or speech (half the class watches the video while the other half faces away)</li>

					<li>Subtitled films (students see and hear the English language)</li>

					<li>Picture-less listening (listening to the audio before watching the video)</li>
				</ul>

				</div>

<!-- Page 14 -->

				<p class="bodytext">
					To awaken students’ curiosity, I made use 
					of picture-less technique and had my students 
					listen to the sound of the video first. To focus 
					on modals of speculation, students listen and 
					guess the origin of the sounds they hear in the 
					video. This arouses their curiosity and invites 
					them to speculate. 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					As Harmer (2007) notes, there are three 
					ways of using this picture-less listening technique
					when a TV set is available in your 
					classroom: (1) cover the screen with a piece 
					of paper, (2) turn the screen away from students,
					or (3) turn the brightness control all 
					the way down. If your class is equipped with a 
					computer and video projector, you can simply 
					turn off the projector and have your students 
					listen to the sound. You can also keep the 
					projector on and minimize the window so 
					that the students cannot see the video. You 
					may also ask the students to close their eyes 
					and just listen to the sound, or to move their 
					chairs and sit with their backs to the screen. 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					I wanted to create a speculating environment
					from the very beginning of the lesson, 
					so I wrapped the whole screen in newspaper 
					before the beginning of the class. As soon as 
					the students entered the class they were faced 
					with a covered TV, a sight that got their attention;
					they immediately began speculating why 
					the TV was covered. I could see they were all 
					surprised, and they wanted to know why I 
					had covered the TV. They started talking to 
					each other and guessing why I had done that. 
					A couple of students even asked me why the 
					TV was covered, and I asked them to wait for 
					a moment to see why, and this made them 
					even more curious. Since the students were 
					very excited, I gave them a couple of minutes 
					to talk to each other because what was happening
					in the class was helping me build the 
					desirable context.

				<h2>Teaching the video lesson</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					I began by explaining to the students that 
					they were going to listen to a series of sounds 
					and had to guess the origin, which was why 
					I had covered the TV. The students were 
					intrigued. I asked them to note their thoughts 
					while I played the audio of the videotape. To 
					illustrate the procedure and make sure they all 
					understood the instructions, I played the first 
					scene and asked them to guess what the sound 
					was. Then I continued, pausing at the end of 
					each scene for about 15 seconds to allow them 
					to make notes. I repeated this same process 
					until they had listened to the whole video. 
					Then I played the video again while they 
					checked their notes. Next, students formed 
					pairs and took three minutes to discuss their 
					notes with their partner. Students enjoyed 
					discussing their very different ideas about the 
					origin of the sounds they had heard.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Students then listened to the video once 
					more. But this time, at the end of each scene 
					they discussed their ideas together. After making
					sure they all understood the instructions, 
					I played the video once more, pausing at the 
					end of each scene to ask them to identify the 
					sound. By asking questions, I encouraged them 
					to use the appropriate grammatical structures. 
					For instance, when I played the part where I 
					was blow drying my hair, I asked, “What could 
					it be? Could it be a vacuum cleaner?” One student
					said, “Yes, it might be a vacuum cleaner,” 
					whereas another one said, “No, it can’t be a 
					vacuum cleaner.” When they were not able to 
					use the structure, I prompted them to use the 
					modal construction by asking tag questions, 
					such as “It can’t be a vacuum cleaner, can it?” 
					In order to respond to my question, students 
					had to use the teaching point.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					I elicited their answers—for example, “It 
					might be a vacuum cleaner” or “It can’t be a 
					washing machine”—and wrote them on the 
					board. Then I underlined the “modal + verb 
					<em>to be</em>” with another color to help them notice 
					the new structure. I continued the process 
					about the origin of all the sounds in the 
					video, and I produced a list of their speculations
					on the board where the new structure 
					and the modals were underlined and highlighted.
					Then I removed the newspaper from 
					the TV screen and let them watch the entire 
					video. This was the most interesting part of 
					the lesson because the students had a lot of 
					fun, laughing at some of their speculations. 
					Finally, in order to teach the students where 
					exactly each of the modals on the board 
					could be used, I asked them which of these 
					structures was used for expressing possibility, 
					probability, certainty, and impossibility, and 
					wrote these terms on the board right below 
					the underlined structures. For instance, I 
					asked, “When do we usually use ‘<em>must</em> + 
					<em>be</em>’? Do we use it when we are certain about 
					something? Or do we use is when we think

					something is possible?” Some of the students 
					said, “When we are certain about it.” Then 
					I wrote “certainty” on the board right below 
					the structure. Finally, I reviewed the new 
					structures and their usages with the students 
					and answered their questions.

			<section class="subsection" data-number="7" data-name="Suggestions for variation">

				<h2>Suggestions for variation</h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					The idea behind video and sound effects 
					lessons can be used to teach a variety of con-tent such as grammar, vocabulary, and creative 
					writing to a wide range of ESL/EFL students.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Teaching grammar</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The same video can be used to teach different
					grammar points, such as present and past 
					simple, present and past progressive, future 
					simple, and “going to+ infinitive” without 
					to, all by using the technique of freeze framing.
					In order to teach grammar, you need 
					to play the video, freeze framing the picture 
					after each scene, and then ask questions. For 
					instance, freeze frame the picture and ask your 
					students questions like, “What is s/he doing?” 
					“What did s/he do?” “What was s/he doing?” 
					“What is s/he going to do next?” or “What 
					will happen next?” In this way students will 
					be prompted to use the teaching point. Once 
					you elicit their answers, write them on the 
					board and highlight the structure (e.g., “to be
					+ ing” form of the verb for present progressive,
					or “will+ infinitive” without tofor future 
					simple). Since the video consists of a sequence 
					of action, adverbs like first, second, finally, 
					before,and latercan also be introduced to and 
					practiced with students.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Teaching vocabulary</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The same video that I used with my students
					can be used to teach vocabulary items 
					on home and kitchen appliances by recording 
					sounds and having students guess the origin. 
					Being careful to respect people’s privacy, you 
					can also take the camera around the school, or 
					even outside the school, and record a variety 
					of interesting sounds. For instance, you can 
					record the sound of students playing at recess, 
					the period between classes, or sounds in the 
					lunchroom and then play the video for your 
					students and have them guess the source of 
					the sound. Or you can record the sounds in 
					a busy coffee shop, a nearby underground 
					station, or a noisy shopping center and play 
					a guessing game with students. You can 
					even teach vocabulary about different jobs by 
					taking your camera with you to record the 
					butcher who is cutting or grinding meat or 
					the cashier who opens the register and returns 
					your change. 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Another interesting variation is to enlist 
					your students to record videos. For example, 
					you can ask them to record sounds during a 
					picnic or some other activity they do on the 
					weekend. These videos can become part of 
					your repertoire to teach grammar and vocabulary.
					If you think your students might not 
					have access to a camera, you can give them the 
					option of recording sounds with their MP3 
					and MP4 players.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Teaching writing</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The same video that I used in my class 
					can be used as a visual prompt for writing 
					assignments at different levels of English. As 
					George (2002, 12) points out, “Our students 
					have a much richer imagination for what we 
					might accomplish with the visual than our 
					journals have yet to address.” To use videos in 
					the writing class, you can show the video to 
					your students using the picture-less listening 
					technique and ask them to write a story based 
					on the sounds they hear in the video. You do 
					not even have to show them the video, as the 
					soundtrack itself serves as an effective audio 
					prompt for writing. You can also ask your 
					students to videotape random scenes around 
					them and bring their videos to class. Then 
					they can watch the videos together and create 
					stories that match the videos.

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Finding appropriate teaching materials is 
					not that hard, as our everyday life serves as a 
					perfect resource for creating effective lessons 
					and activities. An effective lesson does not necessarily
					require expensive and high-tech materials;
					oftentimes, breaking the routines will excite 
					students, engage them in the lesson, and teach 
					them the real use of language in context. Thus, 
					one of the easiest and least expensive ways for 
					teachers to prepare the most effective teaching 
					materials is to look around and never underestimate
					their sense of creativity.
