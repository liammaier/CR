				<p class="firstletter _11three">C</p>

					ntent-based instruction (CBI) 
					is not a new term for foreign 
					language teachers. By some 
					accounts, CBI has been employed 
					since the ancient Akkadians adopted 
					Sumerian as the medium of instruction
					to educate their young in science 
					and religion (Mehisto, Frigols, and 
					Marsh 2008, 9). In the modern era, 
					content-based approaches to language 
					instruction have been employed in 
					various forms since at least the 1960s, 
					when Canadian language educators 
					began teaching academic content in 
					French to English mother-tongue children
					(Stoller 2008). Yet a large proportion
					of today’s teachers of English as a 
					Foreign Language (EFL) have never 
					had the opportunity to try out CBI 
					in their own classrooms—and many 
					of these teachers may lack key professional
					knowledge and skills that are 
					critical to successful CBI teaching. At 
					the same time, CBI approaches are 
					playing an increasingly prominent role 
					in institutional, national, and regional 
					foreign language curricula, as for example
					in various Content and Language 
					Integrating Learning (CLIL) projects 
					that are being implemented in Europe 
					(Fernandez Fontecha 2009; Lorenzo, 
					Casal, and Moore 2009; Navés 2009; 
					Seikkula-Leino 2007; Serra 2007).

					The purpose of this article is to 
					consider ways that language-teacher 
					education programs can better prepare
					future CBI teachers. After providing
					a brief rationale for why CBI 
					approaches are particularly relevant 
					in the 21st century, I will consider the 
					competencies and skills that the language
					teachers of tomorrow will need 
					to effectively integrate content and 
					language instruction in their courses.

				<p>
					For students learning English in a foreign language
					context (as opposed to a second language 
					context such as the United States or Canada), 
					these BICS exchanges would presumably 
					occur when they travelled to another country 
					or when tourists visited the EFL students’ own 
					countries. For many learners—especially those 
					from lower socio-economic backgrounds or 
					locations rarely visited by foreign tourists—
					this presumption is obviously problematic. 
					In practice, students in such settings have 
					very few opportunities to use English outside 
					the classroom. As a result, these students see 
					little reason why they should learn “general” 
					English and, as a result, often fail to do so.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					With the increasing globalization of education,
					however, learning English has acquired 
					new relevance for many students. This process
					of globalization is especially true at the 
					undergraduate and graduate levels, but has 
					also become relevant to learners at other 
					points in their educational careers. Even for 
					learners who may never actually study at an 
					English-medium school or university, the 
					prevalence of learning materials and scholarly 
					information published in English means that 
					the language is relevant for anyone who wishes 
					to pursue an advanced level of education 
					(Hyland 2006, 2009; Snow and Uccelli 2009; 
					Tardy 2004). In response to this situation, 
					EFL teachers have begun to recognize that the 
					main reason many learners study English is 
					to access academic content through English. 
					For such learners, a general EFL approach is 
					no longer seen as sufficiently related to their 
					learning needs and objectives. Instead, greater 
					emphasis is placed on the acquisition of what 
					Cummins (1981, 1984) termed <em>cognitive academic
					language proficiency</em> (CALP) in English 
					for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses. 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					As many teachers have discovered over 
					the past 50 years, a CBI approach lends itself 
					especially well to helping students develop 
					academic language skills (Eurydice 2006; 
					Gonzalez and St. Louis 2002; Owens 2002; 
					Rodgers 2006). A base of empirical evidence 
					has existed for some time to support the 
					idea that CBI approaches provide increased 
					contextualization for language learning in 
					comparison to traditional grammar-based or 
					communicative language teaching approaches,
					leading to comparatively greater gains in 
					student language proficiency (Brinton, Snow, 
					and Wesche 1989; Grabe and Stoller 1997). 
					In addition, evidence now exists to refute 
					claims that students who learn content in 
					a second language will automatically fail to 
					gain as much knowledge as peers who learn 
					content in their native language, provided 
					that sufficient learning support is made available
					to them (Janzen 2008; Lorenzo, Casal, 
					and Moore 2009; Serra 2007). Such research 
					is also of clear relevance to educators in multilingual
					settings where the main language of 
					instruction is a national language, but not 
					necessarily the students’ first language.

				<h2>What future language teachers need to know to successfully implement CBI</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					In many countries where English is taught 
					as a foreign language, the preparation of 
					pre-service English teachers currently takes 
					place in one of four academic areas: linguistics,
					language pedagogy, literary studies, or 
					translation/interpretation. In some countries, 
					pre-service EFL teachers are required to take 
					courses in several of these areas. In other 
					countries, prospective EFL teachers may focus 
					their studies on one area, with limited exposure
					to other areas. In the remainder of this 
					article, I will argue that the preparation of 
					future CBI teachers must be at the same time 
					both more focused (in terms of the specialized 
					professional knowledge and skills they will 
					need) and broader (in terms of the general 
					academic skills they should possess). I will do 
					so by considering four attributes that future 
					EFL teachers will have to possess to successfully
					implement CBI: language proficiency, 
					academic skills, pedagogical knowledge, and 
					content-language interface skills.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Language proficiency</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					It generally goes without saying that foreign
					language teachers should be proficient 
					users of the target language. This is often an 
					area of concern among teacher educators and 
					educational administrators, however, as well 
					as a source of self-doubt for many practicing
					EFL teachers. One way to better prepare 
					future CBI teachers would be to more clearly 
					specify the types and levels of language proficiency
					that will be required of them. This 
					clarification, in turn, would allow teacher 
					educators to better determine how language 
					proficiency should be addressed in the cur-

					riculum for pre-service CBI teachers and to 
					devote sufficient instructional time for students
					to attain the necessary language skills.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Some pre-service teacher education programs
					already address the <em>level</em> of English proficiency
					expected of prospective EFL teachers 
					by referencing, for example, an external standard
					such as a given level on the Common 
					European Framework of Reference or a target 
					score on the Test of English as a Foreign Language
					(TOEFL). However, fewer programs 
					specify the <em>types</em> of language that teacher candidates
					should be proficient in. Referencing 
					the TOEFL iBT might indicate that the given 
					program places a priority on general academic 
					English. This type of language—Cummins’ 
					CALP—may be viewed as a necessary basis for 
					becoming an adequately skilled CBI teacher. 
					But tests such as the TOEFL iBT are designed 
					to assess a learner’s ability to use English to 
					<em>study</em> academic content; these tests do not 
					assess prospective teachers’ ability to use English
					to <em>teach</em> academic content. 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					To truly succeed at merging content and 
					language instruction, especially at higher levels
					of education, the prospective teacher will 
					need to develop advanced language skills that 
					will enable him or her to meet the demands of 
					a range of classroom language-use tasks. These 
					tasks include typical classroom management 
					practices that many teachers already perform 
					in English, such as setting instructions for 
					student assignments, organizing students into 
					groups, and directing students to turn their 
					attention to the board or a certain page in 
					their books. Other classroom language-use 
					tasks may be specific to CBI contexts. For 
					example, CBI teachers will need to be able to 
					make both language and subject-area content 
					information accessible to students. To do so, 
					they will need to be able to comprehend, 
					explain, and model academic discourse patterns
					and vocabulary usage.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Many of the communicative exchanges 
					future students engage in will be between 
					speakers of multiple native languages, as 
					opposed to exchanges with native speakers 
					of English, so it is important that pre-service 
					CBI teachers adopt an understanding of <em>lingua
					franca</em> uses of English and how these uses 
					will impact the teaching and learning of 
					English. To be ready to take part in an interconnected
					globalized world, learners will need 
					to develop skills to comprehend a range of 
					different world Englishes, rather than just one 
					British or American standard. Yet many current
					teachers continue to insist that they were 
					taught to speak one variety, so their learners 
					will learn to use that variety, too. The pedagogical
					norms that future CBI teachers adopt 
					should be those that best insure cross-cultural 
					intelligibility (Jenkins 2006; McKay 2002).
				</p>

				<p><strong>Academic skills</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					If language teachers are to prepare students 
					to learn content in a second language, they 
					themselves should be proficient users of the 
					academic skills and strategies that support 
					content learning. Unfortunately, these skills 
					are rarely the focus of explicit instruction, 
					with the notable exception of some intensive 
					English or first-year academic writing programs.
					Rather, in most settings, learners are 
					expected to acquire these skills in an ad hoc 
					fashion simply by “being students.” That they 
					often fail to do so should not be surprising.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Future CBI teachers should be able to 
					research and comprehend content from a 
					diverse range of academic fields, both in order 
					to model proficient academic performance for 
					their students and to enable them to develop 
					effective CBI lessons and materials. These 
					teachers will need to develop skills such as 
					information retrieval, note-taking, paraphrasing,
					summarizing, and synthesizing. As noted 
					above, future CBI teachers will also have to 
					present academic content in a way that makes 
					it accessible to learners of varying levels of 
					target language proficiency and academic 
					preparedness. To do so, future CBI teachers 
					will also need to have a firm command of oral 
					presentation and academic writing skills.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					As noted earlier, the acquisition of these 
					skills cannot be left to chance. That is, pre-service
					teachers should not be expected to 
					develop advanced proficiency in these critical
					academic skills simply by writing a few 
					research papers or giving a handful of presentations
					in the course of their university education.
					Rather,each of these skills should be 
					the focus of explicit instruction, preferably in 
					the early stages of the pre-service CBI teacher 
					education program. As pre-service teachers 
					approach graduation, treatment of these skills 
					should gradually shift from practice-thru-application
					to sustained consideration and

					discussion of how they will teach these skills 
					as future teachers.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Pedagogical knowledge and skills</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					To be able to make both language and 
					content accessible to students, future CBI 
					teachers will need to possess a range of professional
					knowledge and skills. In this section, I 
					will consider five areas that should be incorporated
					into pre-service CBI teacher education 
					programs.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					<strong>Effective practices, not all-encompassing 
					methods.</strong> The professional texts and journals 
					that have appeared in our field over the past 
					decade have been full of discussions of “post-method
					approaches” and “principles of effective
					language teaching.” But when one speaks 
					to new teachers or students in language-teacher
					education programs, one often hears about 
					courses that are little more than a review of 
					the “named” language teaching methods, such 
					as Suggestopedia or The Silent Way. Even the 
					way that Communicative Language Teaching 
					is often presented—with few specifics and 
					little beyond a vague notion of what it is not: 
					all the bad old methods that didn’t work—can 
					understandably lead pre-service teachers to 
					believe that ours is a field that is still searching 
					for that one perfect method that will magically
					turn all of our students into polyglots. In 
					place of this slavish devotion to methods, pre-service
					CBI teachers need to be introduced to 
					and given extensive opportunities to observe 
					and try out for themselves teaching practices
					that have been shown through empirical 
					research to support effective language and 
					content learning. 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Stoller (2002) outlined a number of such 
					practices that have proven to be especially 
					supportive of student learning in CBI classrooms.
					Typically, successful CBI classrooms 
					provide students multiple opportunities to 
					receive sustained input on the content they are 
					learning. Successful CBI classrooms also typically
					incorporate learning tasks and project 
					work that encourage collaboration between 
					learners. Oftentimes learners are asked to 
					work together to complete multi-stage group 
					projects that take them deeper into a topic 
					than a typical language-learning textbook 
					will. Like mainstream subject-area classrooms, 
					successful CBI language classes engage students
					in a process of gathering information, 
					processing that information, and reporting on 
					what they have learned. Because students are 
					engaging with a variety of sources and reporting
					what they learn in a variety of ways, successful
					CBI classrooms also tend to allow for 
					the natural integration of language skills. CBI 
					also provides a natural framework for the integration
					of learning strategies and language-use 
					strategies.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Perhaps the most radical difference between 
					CBI classrooms and traditional language classrooms
					is the way that language is taught. In 
					the CBI classroom, language instruction is 
					presented in a highly contextualized manner. 
					Rather than being based on a chronological 
					progression of grammatical forms as in more 
					traditional language classrooms, the selection 
					of grammar and vocabulary activities in CBI 
					classes is based on the texts that students are 
					asked to read or listen to in order to learn and 
					relate new content knowledge. Good CBI also 
					makes use of a wide range of visual support 
					and graphic organizers to scaffold content 
					and language learning. Finally, successful CBI 
					classrooms often incorporate some culminating
					activity that allows students to synthesize 
					new information about a given topic and 
					display it in creative, personally meaningful 
					ways.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					<strong>Understanding how different learners 
					learn differently.</strong> In addition to the practices 
					mentioned in the previous paragraph, future 
					CBI teachers need to recognize that different 
					learners will progress through content and 
					language learning stages at different paces, 
					and will need different types and amounts of 
					scaffolding support to achieve content and 
					language learning targets. These teachers will 
					need to develop skills for identifying what 
					motivates individual learners, along with 
					skills to help those students set and achieve 
					personal learning objectives. They will need 
					to help those learners understand how they 
					themselves learn best, and how they can 
					develop cognitive and metacognitive strategies
					to improve their learning performance. 
					Finally, future teachers will themselves need 
					guidance on how such student-centered 
					teaching can be incorporated within the 
					context of their specific local or national educational
					system, which may not necessarily be 
					structured to support differentiated instruction
					of this sort.

				<p class="bodytext">
					<strong>Materials development and syllabus 
					design.</strong> The shortage of relevant, appropriate 
					materials is a constant dilemma for CBI teachers.
					Generally, language-learning textbooks 
					that purport to be content- or theme-based 
					rarely treat a given topic in sufficient depth 
					to afford students multiple opportunities to 
					receive sustained input on the topic. At the 
					same time, subject-area course books designed 
					for use with native-speaker students will likely 
					not provide sufficient language scaffolding to 
					support content learning by second language 
					users. As a result, most committed CBI teachers
					have to become materials developers. To 
					do this, they need skills for adapting authentic 
					materials to support learner comprehension 
					(Evans, Hartshorn, and Anderson 2010). Or, 
					when they cannot find suitable authentic 
					materials, they have to be able to create 
					purpose-built materials (Swales 2009). Future 
					teachers should be able to work with other 
					teachers in a collaborative spirit to develop 
					and share materials. Thankfully, there are 
					now online repositories of CBI lessons and 
					materials (e.g., http://carla.umn.edu/cobaltt/
					lessonplans/search.html; http://ccn-clil.eu/
					index.php?name=MaterialBrowse). These useful
					collections will continue to grow if future 
					CBI teachers are prepared to contribute lesson 
					plans and materials that they create for their 
					own classes.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					<strong>Assessment for learning.</strong> In many educational
					systems, standardized tests determine
					what teachers and students do in the 
					classroom. While many educators decry such 
					“teaching to the test,” they are nevertheless
					expected (by school directors, parents, 
					and students themselves) to do everything 
					possible to make sure the students do well 
					on major national exams. In the context of 
					language learning, the result is that students 
					may be able to solve common exam question
					types (e.g., grammar or vocabulary gap 
					fills, multiple-choice reading comprehension 
					questions), but may not necessarily be able 
					to use English for actual communication. In 
					contrast, in effective CBI classrooms, assessment
					is used to support student learning, 
					rather than to direct it. Teacher and students 
					use information gathered via different assessments
					to gauge how students are progressing 
					towards content and language-learning goals 
					and to determine whether additional instructional
					time or learning support is needed for 
					students to achieve those goals.
				</p>

				<div class="bodytext">
					In many ways, making the shift from an 
					exam-driven assessment approach to one that 
					is more student-centered may be seen as a 
					policy question that is beyond the control of 
					the local school or teacher. That is, it may be 
					seen as something that must be resolved at 
					the national level. However, it may also be 
					possible to address such issues at the level of 
					the school or classroom. All it takes are a few 
					enlightened school directors or department 
					heads to find creative solutions to institutional 
					assessment and grading policy. The objective 
					should be to empower teachers to use classroom
					assessments for their intended purpose: 
					giving students feedback on their learning 
					performance that can be used to improve subsequent
					learning.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					But if future CBI teachers are to be 
					empowered in this way, they also need to 
					possess skills that will allow them to make 
					productive use of this power. This means 
					being able to design classroom assessments 
					that go beyond discrete-point grammar and 
					vocabulary quizzes. It also means being able 
					to give substantive feedback that goes beyond 
					error identification and direct correction. It 
					means being able to give in-depth qualitative 
					feedback on student performance and progress
					towards content and language learning 
					objectives. And it means being able to guide 
					students in developing effective peer- and self-assessment skills.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					<strong>Incorporating educational technologies.</strong>
					We all recognize that new technologies are 
					impacting the ways that languages are taught 
					and learned. Some EFL teachers may be 
					enthusiastic adopters of new technologies, 
					while others may be more hesitant or unconvinced
					of their merit. But, for increasing 
					numbers of us, one thing that is certain is 
					that our students—a group that includes 
					future teachers—are growing up in a world 
					where digital technologies play a central role 
					in their everyday lives. This close involvement
					with technology is changing the way 
					these students approach and consume information,
					and the way they expect information 
					to be presented to them. As a result, future 
					CBI teachers will need to possess technological
					skills that will allow them to reach Net 
					Generation students.

<!-- Page 7 -->

				<p class="bodytext">
					Many technologies are already being used 
					to effectively support CBI projects. It has 
					become commonplace in schools and classrooms
					around the world to use the Internet as 
					a means to access information. To be effective 
					consumers of Internet information, students 
					need to be taught how to effectively evaluate 
					the trustworthiness of information sources. 
					It is also now common for students to collaborate
					with peers from around the world 
					on content and language-learning projects. 
					Such international collaborative projects give 
					students important opportunities to learn 
					firsthand about using English for intercultural 
					communication.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					With all the content- and language-learning
					tools and resources that are available, 
					future teachers must be cautioned against 
					using the “computer as babysitter” approach 
					to instruction. CBI teachers (future or present)
					should not simply plop students down 
					in front of a Computer-assisted Language 
					Learning program or the Internet and say “Go 
					on, be autonomous! Learn English!” Unfortunately,
					this has been an all-too-common 
					approach to integrating technology into the 
					language classroom.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					In place of this approach, future CBI 
					teachers will need to be able to prepare well-structured,
					well-rationed learning tasks that 
					incorporate technology and provide the necessary
					support for students to benefit from that 
					technology. Ultimately, future CBI teachers 
					won’t necessarily have to be taught about 
					specific technologies such as concordancers 
					or video editing software as much as they 
					will need to be taught how technology can 
					be effectively incorporated into content and 
					language teaching.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Content-language interface skills</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Many of the items in the three sets of 
					knowledge and skills presented above are 
					topics that many good pre-service teacher 
					education programs already address with 
					their students. This last set considers two 
					aspects that are more specific to instructional
					approaches that integrate language 
					and content learning. The first is the need 
					for future CBI teachers to understand the 
					links between emerging L2 proficiency and 
					language and content learning progress. The 
					second is the equally important need for 
					future CBI teachers to be able to work effectively
					with subject-area teachers.
					Future CBI teachers will need a clear 
					understanding of how emerging proficiency 
					in both the first and second language will 
					impact content and language learning achievement.
					There is often popular concern around 
					English-medium or dual-language instruction 
					that students will fail to develop both their 
					understanding of academic content and their 
					native language skills. A great deal of evidence, 
					however, especially from Canadian immersion 
					education, shows that given sufficient time 
					and support, bilingual students ultimately perform
					as well or better than their monolingual 
					peers on both content and native language 
					assessments, despite initially lagging behind.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Future CBI teachers need to be aware 
					of this research and need to know how the 
					learning processes and progress of students 
					in dual-language programs will differ from 
					those of students in traditional monolingual 
					programs. This knowledge will enable these 
					teachers to adjust their instructional strategies 
					appropriately and reassure concerned parents, 
					students, and school directors.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Future CBI teachers will also need the 
					professional and social skills to form effective 
					partnerships with subject-area instructors. In 
					traditional educational settings, there is an 
					assumption that language teaching and content
					teaching are two separate things, and 
					that one is the responsibility of the language 
					teacher and the other is the responsibility of 
					the content teacher. In schools that sincerely 
					want to undertake a CBI approach, the view 
					should be that teaching language and teaching 
					content are a shared responsibility. This view 
					is typically rare among subject-area teachers. 
					But even in the most traditional settings, one 
					or two enlightened subject-area teachers may 
					realize that their students will need additional 
					language support if they are really going to use 
					English to acquire new content knowledge. 
					And these instructors, if they are truly enlightened,
					may actually realize that they themselves 
					will need assistance structuring their lessons 
					so that the concepts they are teaching (in L1 
					or L2) can offer proper support for and reinforcement
					of student learning. Future CBI 
					teachers will need to be able to identify and 
					work with potential partners like this (Horn, 
					Stoller, and Robinson 2008).

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Future CBI teachers will have to possess 
					a broad range of professional knowledge 
					and skills to help language learners achieve 
					objectives that are relevant in the globalized 
					academic world. These teachers will themselves
					need to possess sufficient linguistic and 
					academic skills to be able to access content in 
					English. They will also need appropriate pedagogical
					knowledge to support their students 
					in acquiring advanced academic language 
					proficiency. In some settings, these demands 
					may require teacher educators to rethink their 
					approach to language teaching and teacher 
					preparation. Although this may seem like a 
					daunting undertaking, the potential payoff 
					would be well worth the effort: When language
					courses become a means for learning 
					about the world we live in, rather than just 
					learning about a language, students will better 
					appreciate the relevance of English to their 
					personal learning goals and their future objectives.
					As they progress in their learning, students
					will see that becoming more proficient 
					in English enables them to learn more about 
					the topics and fields that interest them most. 
					This is the virtuous circle of increased motivation
					and improved learning that awaits future 
					CBI teachers and their students.
