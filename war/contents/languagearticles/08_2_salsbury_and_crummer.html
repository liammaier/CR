				<h1>Using Teacher-Developed Corpora in the CBI Classroom</h1>

				<p class="firstletter _08two">T</p>

				<p class="firstpagebody1 _08two">
					his article advocates the 
					inclusion of teacher-generat-ed corpora and activities that 
					involve student analyses of corpora in 
					content-based instruction (CBI). The 
					content-based course discussed in this 
					article was designed for engineering 
					and architecture students at a large 
					Mexican university. The corpus was 
					compiled from textbooks as well as 
					from representative journal articles 
					and manuals that students use in their 
					university content courses. We made 
					this corpus available to the students 
					enrolled in the class, and it became the 
					corpus that students analyzed to rein-force lessons with grammar, vocabu-lary, and writing.
				</p>

				<p class="firstpagebody2 _08two">
					Such teacher-facilitated analyses of 
					authentic language samples found in 
					spoken and written language corpora 
					help students recognize and identify 
					patterns in language use that are differ-ent from how they intuitively use the 
					foreign language and even from how 
					the language is presented and taught 
					in their textbooks. Thus, through a 
					well-focused, teacher-directed look at 
					these language patterns, students can 
					become more target-like in their writ-ten and oral production. Moreover, 
					corpus-based instruction is especially 
					valuable in the case of CBI in an 
					English as a foreign language (EFL) 
					teaching and learning environment 
					because the teacher’s corpus could 
					feasibly comprise authentic texts cen-tered around one theme (in this case, 
					engineering), which would allow stu-dents to increase their vocabulary 
					knowledge and awareness of academic 
					language use patterns in a specific 
					content area or academic field.

						To clarify, a corpus is a body of

						words function and form patterns in 
						the text in relation to other words.

				Lexical associations, or collocations, are 
				how certain words co-occur in spoken or 
				written texts. By performing a corpus analysis 
				of the collocations of texts, language teachers 
				and students are able to target key vocabulary 
				in certain genres. For example, Stoller and 
				Jones (2003) analyzed the use of the word 
				paperin their corpus of chemistry texts, and 
				found that it most frequently followed the 
				phrase in this, to form the collocation of in 
				this paper. Similarly, Stoller and Jones (2003) 
				analyzed the word shownto demonstrate how 
				it differs in use in the introduction, results, 
				and discussion sections of peer-reviewed journal articles.
			</p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				Grammatical associations, or colligations, 
				are then derived from the lexical patterns 
				that tend to occur in a text. By performing 
				a corpus analysis of the colligations of texts, 
				language teachers and students are able to 
				confirm their own personal intuitions about 
				grammar use in certain genres. Moreover, 
				through the use of corpora, grammar patterns 
				can be observed, introduced, and taught in 
				the context of their actual use in oral and 
				written discourse. For example, Stoller and 
				Jones (2003) analyzed the frequency of passive voice in chemistry texts, in addition to 
				the most common passive verbs, providing valuable information for students of 
				chemistry on how to become a part of the 
				chemistry discourse community. Stoller and 
				Jones (2003) point out that the high frequency use of passive voice in chemistry texts 
				contradicts the popular myth among English 
				teachers that the use of passive voice contributes to weak writing practices.

		<section class="subsection" data-number="2" data-name="Authenticity of task and text">

			<h2>Authenticity of task and text</h2>
				
			<p class="bodytext">
				In teaching from corpora with second 
				language learners, the task, not the text itself, 
				is the most relevant component of authenticity (Mishan 2004). This is because the actual 
				texts in a computer-based corpus are stripped 
				of all formatting, making it impossible to 
				discern titles, headers, and captions from the 
				actual body of the text. Illustrations, which 
				provide important context for comprehension 
				and are essential in conveying a text’s authenticity to the reader, are likewise absent from 
				a text once it is made ready to be analyzed 
				on the computer. Similarly, spoken texts in a 
				corpus do not include questions and responses 
				from other participants in the conversation, 
				making much of the context and meaning of 
				the spoken text incomprehensible. Indeed, the 
				texts that comprise a corpus that is analyzed 
				electronically, though authentic in word use, 
				are void of the essential context that originally 
				gave them shape.
			</p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				The authenticity of a text depends on the 
				reader’s relationship to it (Widdowson 2000), 
				and this relationship is created by the task that 
				the student is engaged in with the text. Thus, 
				for use in second language pedagogy, a corpus 
				must be authenticated via the tasks assigned 
				with it and the kinds of questions that students 
				and teachers ask of the corpus (McCarthy and 
				Carter 2001). The methodology of engaging 
				second language learners in research tasks with 
				a corpus is referred to as data-driven learning 
				(DDL) (Mishan 2004). Students engage in 
				corpus research through bottom-up, inductive reasoning as well as top-down, deductive 
				reasoning via the traditional research method 
				of forming hypotheses, experimenting, and 
				drawing conclusions.
			</p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				Content-based instruction draws heavily, 
				if not entirely, from authentic texts. Our 
				approach to authenticity parallels Wiesen 
				(2000) in that we gave students science and 
				engineering texts in their original format. 
				Some of the texts were abridged but none 
				were simplified. Our learners were motivated to see authentic texts in their English 
				language course, and we found little of the 
				initial resistance from students to theme-based CBI discussed in the literature (Stoller 
				2004; Wiesen 2000). Part of the enthusiasm 
				for the course stemmed from the data-driven 
				tasks that explored the science and engineering corpus that we compiled. Our approach 
				to authenticity was multi-faceted. Students 
				read authentic texts designed for high school 
				and college students in the United States. 
				They watched video recordings of American news specials and educational material 
				related to the science and engineering themes 
				chosen for the course. They engaged in academic reading and writing tasks using
				peer-reviewed journal articles. They participated 
				in authentic speaking tasks via poster-session presentations, discussions and debates. 
				Finally, they engaged in authentic research 
				in language study using a corpus—the focus 
				of this article.

				Because we worked directly with the content area faculty, we were able to choose texts 
				to analyze that were representative of what the 
				students actually read in their major, and we 
				received advice about the most common discussion topics and types of interactions in the 
				field. Students were involved in text analysis, 
				using the same concordancing programs that 
				we employed as teachers. (See Reppen 2001 
				for a review of MonoConc Pro and WordSmith 
				Tools.) Involvement in text analysis encourages 
				students to be self-directed language learners, systematically analyzing academic uses of 
				the second language. We wanted students to 
				supplement dictionary work with searches of 
				the corpus for content-specific uses of words 
				and grammatical expressions.

			<section class="subsection" data-number="3" data-name="Compiling a corpus">

				<h2>Compiling a corpus</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The one-million word corpus for this 
					project came from nearly 200 texts taken from 
					engineering textbooks, articles from engineering journals, lab manuals from engineering
					classes, and transcripts from the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English 
					(MICASE). We were particularly careful to 
					select from various disciplines within the 
					College of Engineering, Architecture, and 
					Design; thus, our corpus reflects written and 
					spoken texts from electrical, mechanical, and 
					industrial engineering as well as texts from 
					industrial design and architecture.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					McCarthy and Carter (2001) stress that 
					the size of a corpus is less important than the 
					texts the teacher chooses, how those texts are 
					classified, and how the teacher (or students) 
					analyzes the texts. We make the following suggestions to teachers compiling a corpus:
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Choose texts or text types that students 
						are likely to read. Since scanning texts 
						can be time consuming, we suggest 
						starting with key course readings from 
						the first part of the course. Texts that 
						are available in electronic format will 
						facilitate the compilation of the corpus. 
						Many corpora are available for free 
						online (see Appendix); thus, a teacher 
						may choose to scan just one chapter of 
						a class reading and use online corpora 
						to generalize findings.
					</li>

					<li>
						Save the original electronic text as 
						an Adobe Acrobat (<em>.pdf</em>) or Microsoft 
						Word (<em>.doc</em>) file. Since a corpus de-contextualizes language, it is important 
						to have the option of re-contextualizing the data if necessary. (This option 
						is generally not available for corpora 
						found online.) Of course, the original 
						format is essential if students are to 
						read a text as an assigned reading. The 
						text (<em>.txt</em>) files used in corpus analysis 
						are not appropriate for class readings 
						because they are comprised of uniform 
						fonts and spacing that make it difficult 
						to distinguish titles, headers, and captions from the body of the text. Illustrations
						and graphics are also absent.
					</li>

					<li>
						Check the scanner settings when scanning paper texts to electronic format. If 
						scanning to a <em>.pdf</em> file, the scan must 
						be editable so that the file can later be 
						saved as a text file. The scanner should 
						be set to English if this is the target 
						language; otherwise, the scanner will 
						not recognize many words, which will 
						greatly complicate the revision of each 
						text. All scans of paper texts should be 
						spell-checked for errors.
					</li>


					<li>
						Save all electronic files (scans or originals) as text files, and include a short 
						file name that refers back to the original text. Classify the files by text 
						type—e.g., written language, spoken 
						language—and store them in folders by type. Scans of entire textbooks 
						should be divided by chapter, with 
						each chapter stored as a separate file. 
						In this way, students and teachers can 
						cross reference the text file with the 
						source text in easy-to-manage chapters, 
						making it much simpler to go back to 
						the original for context, content, and 
						meaning.
					</li>

					<li>
						Compress the corpus files and folders 
						to a <em>.zip</em> file so that colleagues and students can easily download the corpus 
						from a website, email message, or electronic learning platform. The corpus 
						can then be extracted and saved to the 
						hard drives of students’ computers.
					</li>
				
					<li>
						Take advantage of affordable and free corpus analysis tools available online.
					</li>

				<ol class="blankorderedlist">
					<li>
						Popular corpus analysis tools such as 
						WordSmith Toolsare available for free 
						with limited functionality. This is a 
						good way for teachers to experiment 
						with the software before making a purchase. The free version of the software 
						may be sufficient for the needs of the 
						teacher and students. WordSmith Tools
						allows for 20 concordances, and it also 
						returns totals for word searches (though 
						it does not list the concordances beyond 
						the first 20). We found the free version 
						of the software sufficient for our students’ data-driven learning tasks while 
						we opted to purchase the software for 
						our own computers.

					<li>
						Respect the learning curves of collaborating teachers and students. Using 
						corpus analysis software can be difficult 
						at first. Allow yourself and collaborating teachers plenty of time to become 
						familiar with the software. We found 
						it helpful to practice selecting texts and 
						specifying word searches. Students were 
						generally comfortable with the technology, yet to ensure that everybody knew 
						how to navigate through the activities 
						with the corpus, we spent two one-hour 
						sessions in the first week of class making sure that students had access to the 
						necessary files and software and were 
						able to perform simple searches of their 
						own. In working with our students, we 
						prepared screen shots for each step in 
						the process and modeled in class how to 
						download the software and the corpus, 
						select texts, specify words to search, and 
						read the output.

				<h2>The case of <em>because</em> and <em>although</em></h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					One of our first analyses of the corpus 
					involved comparing the written texts (journal 
					articles, textbooks, lab manuals) to the spoken 
					texts (MICASE). We examined the placement 
					of subordinators according to whether they 
					were in sentence-initial position, where the 
					subordinate clause precedes the main clause, 
					or in what we termed the middle position, 
					where the main clause precedes the subordinate clause. Here we focus only on the subordinators
					<em>because</em> and <em>although</em>.
				</p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					The oral data in our corpus has no occurrence of sentence-initial <em>because</em>;
					rather <em>because</em>
					functions in a subordinate clause to a previous statement (e.g., main clause, subordinate 
					clause), as in the following examples from the 
					corpus:
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>uh you can’t do a swap in two statements <em>because</em> you lose one of the values</li>

					<li>
						It turns out these don’t come out at 
						exactly a hundred and eighty degrees 
						<em>because</em> there is the nu- the uh nuclear 
						recoil happening.
					</li>

					<li>
						we haven’t been able to test them much 
						because we don’t even have model 
						identification
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p class="bodytext">
					In the written data, in contrast, <em>because</em>
					appears in both environments: in sentence-initial subordinate clauses as well as in 
					the middle position (as in the oral data). 
					The following examples from the data illustrate initial <em>because</em> (4) and sentence medial 
					<em>because</em> (5).
				</p>

				<ol start="4">
					<li>
						<em>Because</em> they used quasi-static field 
						theory and circuit method, their methods cannot be used any more when the 
						frequency is higher than 1 MHz.
					</li>

					<li>
						This is not a real sacrifice in performance <em>because</em> the necessary attention 
						to transition details is an essential element of design.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Written data provides more examples of 
					sentence-initial <em>because</em>, as seen in Example 
					(4), but it is still not as common as the middle 
					position, reflecting the same bias that is found 
					in the oral data.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Interestingly, <em>although</em> has an inverse relationship to the data that we find for
					<em>because</em>. 
					Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad, and Finegan 
					(1999) found that <em>although</em> is more frequent 
					in academic [written] prose than in oral 
					conversation. Our data confirms this finding: 
					<em>although</em> rarely appears in the oral data. However, in the written data, where it is found, it 
					is most common in sentence-initial position, 
					as in the following examples:
				</p>

				<ol start="6">
					<li>
						<em>Although</em> these projects were used in 
						a computer architecture course, they 
						could easily be applied in other courses.
					</li>

					<li>
						<em>Although</em> the quantity of modes is usually unlimited, the higher modes have 
						the smallest amplitudes and thus can be 
						neglected.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p class="bodytext">
					We guided our students through similar 
					bottom-up enquiry using the corpus. First, 
					we enhanced an assigned reading on engineering ethics by highlighting all occurrences 
					of <em>although</em> in yellow and all occurrences of 
					becausein light blue. Students were asked to 
					work in groups to read the text, scanning first 
					for the yellow highlighted words, and then 
					writing down at least five example sentences, 
					including punctuation, on the left-hand side 
					of a T-chart. They repeated this procedure for 
					the words highlighted in light blue, writing 
					down example sentences on the right-hand 
					side of the same chart. In pairs, students analyzed each sentence for the following: (a) the 
					placement of the highlighted word in the sentence, (b) words that functioned as the subject 
					of the sentence, (c) words that functioned as 
					the verb in the sentence, and (d) observations 
					about punctuation. As a class, we generated 
					a grammatical rule to describe how <em>because</em>
					and <em>although</em> are used. This rule became our 
					hypothesis.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Next, we tested our hypothesis with our 
					entire corpus of spoken and written language in top-down enquiry. Students worked 
					together with their laptop computers to search 
					our corpus for all occurrences of <em>because</em> and 
					<em>although</em>. Students saw firsthand the same patterns that we had found and came to the same 
					conclusions that we had reached. We believe 
					that such an exercise raises consciousness about 
					the grammatical point in question and functions as a much more powerful instructional 
					technique than the traditional presentation/
					practice model—which characteristically comprises a few artificial sentences from published 
					teaching materials or teacher intuition.

				<h2>Modal auxiliaries—The case of <em>will</em> vs. <em>BE</em> going to</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					As in the previous activity, students started 
					out with an assigned chapter to read which 
					formed the basis for the inductive language 
					work. The chapter dealt with the notion of 
					teamwork, and the class sessions earlier in the 
					week had been devoted to developing student 
					comprehension of the content through various individual and small group activities.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Students searched the electronic version of 
					the chapter for a list of modal auxiliaries and 
					recorded the frequency of each. They ranked 
					each modal in order of frequency from most 
					to least frequent. Figure 1 lists the modal auxiliaries that the students found
					and their corresponding frequency in the corpus. <em>Will</em> was 
					the most frequent modal auxiliary followed 
					by <em>should</em> and then <em>can</em>. Modal auxiliaries that 
					did not appear at all in the chapter were <em>shall</em>, 
					<em>might</em>, <em>have to</em>,and <em>BE going to</em> (the last two 
					being periphrastic or semi-modals).

					</li>
				</ol>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Students were then asked to look again 
					at the colligations of the five most frequent 
					modal auxiliaries in the text and to write 
					down the three to five words that appeared 
					to the right and left of the target word in the 
					sentence, thus briefly reviewing the form of 
					<em>modal auxiliary</em> + <em>verb</em> combinations as well 
					as adverb placement (e.g., “we will <em>promptly</em>
					go”).
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Next, students focused on <em>will</em>, the most 
					common modal auxiliary in the corpus. They 
					searched for this word with <em>WordSmith Tools</em>
					and used the view function in the program to 
					see the entire sentence for each instance of <em>will</em>. 
					Working in small groups, students attempted 
					to generate three distinct definitions of <em>will</em>
					depending on the context of each sentence. 
					Thus, students engaged in guided exploration 
					with the instructor to discover not only that 
					willreferred to future time (e.g., “It would be 
					naive to think that everything <em>will</em> always go 
					well with teams.”) or that it appeared in conditionals (e.g., “If not, frustration
					<em>will</em> build up 
					and lead to conflict.”) but that it also carried 
					a sense of volition or willingness to do some-

					thing (e.g., We <em>will</em> be as open as possible but 
					will honor the right of privacy.”). In fact, <em>will</em>
					for volition was the most frequent use in this 
					particular textbook chapter.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					As a final activity in the class, students 
					searched the entire written corpus to compare 
					the frequencies of <em>will</em> and <em>BE going to</em>. What 
					they found was interesting:  <em>will</em> occurred 
					2,038 times in the corpus whereas <em>going to</em>
					with an inflected form of <em>BE</em> occurred only 
					30 times—that is, one occurrence of <em>BE going to</em>
					for every 68 occurrences of <em>will</em>. Then, 
					students searched the oral data for the same 
					modal expressions. This time, <em>BE going to</em>
					occurred 52 times and <em>will</em> occurred 141 
					times, or roughly one occurrence of <em>BE going to</em>
					for every three occurrences of <em>will</em>. From 
					this exercise, students concluded that  <em>will</em>
					is generally a more common expression for 
					expressing future time (it occurs more frequently than <em>BE going to</em> in both the oral and 
					written data). However, students also learned 
					that as an expression of future time, <em>BE going to</em>
					is more likely to occur in spoken English 
					than in written English.

			<section class="subsection" data-number="6" data-name="Vocabulary analysis - The case of embodied">

				<h2>Vocabulary analysis—The case of <em>embodied</em></h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Students were given opportunities to combine dictionary work with corpus analysis 
					work. In addition to finding definitions of 
					new words, students also discovered peculiarities of certain lexical items. One example 
					comes from a search for the word <em>embodied</em>, 
					which appeared in an introductory reading on ethics in engineering: “Professionals 
					claim to be regulated by ethical standards, 
					usually <em>embodied</em> in a code of ethics” (Harris, 
					Pritchard and Rabins 2004, 13).
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Students were instructed to use <em>WordSmith Tools</em>
					to find all collocates of <em>embodied</em> in the 
					corpus. Figure 2 illustrates what students 
					found in their searches of the corpus.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					As shown in Figure 2, the corpus-search 
					results of <em>embodied</em> show that a majority of 
					collocates (11 out of 13) were followed by the 
					preposition in(e.g., <em>embodied in</em>). Secondly, 
					most examples of <em>embodied</em> from the corpus 
					are the past participle (rather than the past 
					tense). In fact, in every case where <em>in</em> follows 
					<em>embodied</em>, the form of the verb is the past 
					participle in a passive voice construction. We 
					reviewed with students that the English passive voice is constructed with a form of the 
					verb <em>BE + past participle</em>. Interestingly, only 
					the first and the ninth concordances in Figure 
					2 follow this pattern. Nine out of the eleven 
					passive constructions occur in reduced relative 
					clauses (participial phrases), as in this example 
					from the eighth concordance: “the concepts 
					of industrial efficiency [that are] embodied in 
					the discipline of IE….” The relative pronoun 
					<em>that</em> and the auxiliary arehave been omitted 
					so that it reads the concepts of industrial efficiency embodied in the discipline. This was the 
					most common type of occurrence of <em>embodied</em>
					in the data, contrasting with a prototypical 
					account of the English passive voice as consisting of <em>BE + past participle</em>.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					We designed multiple choice questions 
					to guide students in their exploration of the 
					form and meaning of this word. As a class, 
					we searched for <em>emobodied</em> in the corpus and 
					found the definition of <em>embody</em> in the dictionary. We then carefully designed multiple 
					choice questions to guide the students’ investigations. Some sample questions are listed in 
					Figure 3.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The questions in Figure 3 build on each 
					other. The first item focuses student attention 
					on the collocation with <em>in</em>. The next three 
					items review verb forms. Students review past

					A sixth item (not shown) pulled together the

					we asked students to write two sentences 
					using the verb <em>embody</em>. We could have elaborated further by asking students to illustrate

				<h2>Additional ideas and activities</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Mishan (2004) presents a way to teach 
					phrasal verbs through corpus analysis of a 
					single verb, such as get, and its most frequent 
					collocations (e.g., <em>get in, get off, get on, get out</em>). 
					Mishan also discusses how to engage students 
					in exploring the use of <em>speak</em>, <em>say</em>, and <em>tell</em> in 
					the corpus—three words commonly misused 
					by learners of English. Such discovery learning exposes students to authentic language, 
					and, most importantly, involves students in 
					authentic uses of corpora in research tasks.
				</p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Proponents of CBI recognize that language 
					is best taught using content that is interesting, relevant, and meaningful to students. 
					Computerized tools to supplement the CBI 
					approach, including corpus analysis tools, are 
					readily available. However, these tools are by 
					no means prerequisite to CBI course design. 
					One alternative to electronic corpus analysis 
					is a non-computerized, functional analysis of 
					subordinators such as <em>when</em>, <em>after</em>, and <em>during</em>.
					(See Schleppegrell, Achugar, and Oteíza 
					[2004] for a discussion of functional analysis.) 
					Nonetheless, we believe that carefully constructed electronic searches of a much greater 
					amount of text will better inform many 
					language analyses. Teachers and students can 
					learn much more about texts and the generalizability of this new information when those 
					texts can be analyzed by computer software. 
					This is particularly true when the source texts 
					are available in their original format, as they 
					will invariably be if teachers compile their 
					own corpora from the same texts that students 
					use in class.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Teachers and students can expand their 
					analysis of lexical and grammatical features 
					from a single passage or chapter of a text to 
					the whole text as well as to other similar texts. 
					For example, nouns, verbs, and conjunctions that contribute to a text’s abstractness 
					and ambiguity can be quickly searched with 
					corpus analysis software. A corpus analysis 
					is a particularly powerful aid to categorizing 
					verbs, enabling students to explore the different ways words are presented and meaning is 
					constructed. Schleppegrell et al. (2004) suggest that students put verbs into categories 
					such as <em>saying and thinking verbs, relating verbs,</em> 
					and other categories. Thus, the verbs expressed
					or <em>resent</em> can be easily explored by students 
					in the entire text. The functional analysis of

					participant roles in a text can also be supplemented by a thorough bottom-up analysis of 
					an entire text. In a history text, for example, 
					the word <em>government</em> will appear in many different contexts. Rather than analyzing only 
					one context and a rather limited number of 
					clause structures in which the word appears, 
					students can explore how the word is used in 
					many different passages, preferably from sections of the text that they have already read, 
					but also as a preview to future sections and 
					instructional units.
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Helping students conceptualize metalanguage—the language used to talk about language—is
					another powerful use for a corpus 
					and a compelling reason to engage students in 
					its analysis. Learning metalanguage is an important component to any functional analysis of 
					texts, electronic or otherwise. We argue that 
					the authenticity of the language samples and 
					research tasks discussed in this article greatly 
					facilitate the conceptualization of the metalanguage necessary for most language analyses.

					Figure 4 summarizes corpus-based ideas for 
					classroom use of corpora. Teacher-compiled 
					and professional corpora can provide opportunities for inductive and deductive learning. 
					Sysoyev (1999) talks about student exploration as the first stage in integrative gram-mar
					teaching. As with bottom-up approaches 
					to data-driven learning, integrative grammar 
					teaching recognizes the value of allowing students to explore language and formulate rules 
					inductively. A corpus, particularly one that is 
					created by teachers and uses texts with which 
					students are familiar, greatly increases the 
					number of samples needed to induce a rule 
					while at the same time maintaining the familiar context and content of the source text.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Mishan (2004) presents an innovative 
					technique for student-compiled corpora using 
					text sources from the Internet, particularly 
					transcriptions of oral data. Learner-language 
					corpora, typically compiled from students’ 
					written work but also possible with transcriptions of oral interviews, are extremely
					useful for teachers and scholars in longitudinal 
					research with a small set of learners. Learner-language corpora can also be contrasted to 
					native speaker corpora, which is particularly 
					useful in comparing word choice in written 
					essays. Unlike corpora compiled from class 
					texts, learner-language corpora are designed 
					principally for use as models in peer analysis 
					of student writing.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Biber et al. (1999) present lexical bundles 
					or formulaic chunks that occur in various 
					registers. Formulaic chunks are simply collocations that occur together with very high 
					frequency—so high, in fact, that second language learners may analyze them as a single 
					unit or bundle. We have already presented the 
					frequent collocation <em>in this paper</em> discussed by 
					Stoller and Jones (2003) in scientific journal 
					articles. Other examples are <em>would like</em>,
					<em>if I were, would you mind,</em> and <em>I think/don’t think</em>. 
					Students can explore these lexical bundles and 
					other frequent collocations in both spoken 
					and written discourse through analyses of 
					corpora.

					a good source for lexical bundles particularly 
					as they occur in speech acts. Spoken language 
					recorded in transcripts of science programs on 
					TV (e.g., NOVA), can be contrasted to the 
					written language used to discuss similar top-ics, and students can engage in a functional 
					analysis of the language differences depending 
					on register and language medium.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Bottom-up, inductive learning is facili-tated by access to electronic corpora and the 
					means to analyze those corpora. Students 
					can explore myriad vocabulary collocations 
					and grammar structure colligations in both 
					bottom-up, inductive learning as well as 
					top-down, deductive learning. In teacher or 
					student developed corpora, the source texts 
					should be available in their original format 
					as we have already discussed. One of the 
					key advantages to creating one’s own corpus 
					is that it allows for both computer-based 
					and paper-based analyses. We emphasize 
					that paper-based, functional analyses can be 
					greatly supplemented by, but not replaced by, 
					computer-based analysis.

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Corpus linguistics played an important 
					role in the development of a content-based 
					English course for students of engineering, 
					architecture, and design. This article outlined 
					the many ways that corpus analysis may be 
					included in class activities to inform language 
					study and complement functional analyses of 
					texts for improved content learning. Because 
					the students were involved firsthand in corpus 
					analysis, they were invested in the process 
					of learning about language. In this case, the 
					language learning was particularly pertinent 
					to the students as all of the textbooks that 
					we used to compile the corpus came directly 
					from student readings in their university-level 
					content courses, and the journal articles that 
					we chose were of the type that students would 
					be expected to read in the upper-level classes 
					towards the end of their undergraduate career. 
					Focused language of this nature is much more 
					representative of the kind of written and spo-ken language that students will encounter as 
					professionals in their respective fields. Even 
					the most experienced teachers cannot hope 
					to intuit all the nuances of the specialized 
					discourse within various disciplines.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Familiarity with corpus analysis tools 
					becomes a powerful language learning aid for 
					students, one that encourages self-directed 
					learning. There are many lessons for teach-ers as well. Apart from learning more about 
					language, teachers develop valuable new com-puter skills in learning to compile and analyze 
					large amounts of language data. Using a scan-ner to convert paper texts to electronic texts, 
					searching a library database for electronic 
					journal articles, storing and managing large 
					numbers of files, and organizing language data 
					in an Excel spreadsheet are just a few examples 
					of the computer skills that are fostered by a 
					project such as this; these skills will translate 
					into other professional and personal activities. 
					It is both challenging and rewarding to hone 
					new technological skills in the compilation of 
					a language corpus and to discover something 
					new about the language.
