					omework usually consists of 
					the learners’ written account 
					of how they interpreted a 
					task set by the teacher (Farmer 2008; 
					Lantolf and Genung 2002; North and 
					Pillay 2002; Zacarian 2009), and is 
					generally defined as out-of-class assignments that are handed in for the 
					instructor to grade (North and Pillay 
					2002; Yang 2005; Sasaki 1995). Learners may work individually or with 
					partners to answer simple or challenging linguistic exercises, sketch out a 
					mind map, or develop a highly creative 
					piece of writing. Teachers who do the 
					grading are often seen carrying around 
					hard copies of students’ homework, or 
					sitting at computers when it has been 
					sent by email or uploaded to the class 
					group site on the Internet. However, 
					grading is not always the entire responsibility of the teacher, for there are 
					instances when students are seen busily 
					marking each other’s work. Likewise, 
					homework may also include assignments that students set for themselves. 
					If the instructional context allows, 
					these peer correction and student participation options create a learner-centered
					classroom and permit teachers to 
					take on a less controlling role.

					In any case, homework typically 
					has a deadline and agreed upon formal characteristics, such as length, 
					font type, organization, and layout

					with some frequency throughout the 
					course since, as North and Pillay 
					(2002, 137) acknowledge, making 
					more time for homework is normally

					just like regular homework, should 
					have a deadline, be easily collected, 
					and occur regularly throughout the

				Of course, the same procedures are also useful

				<h2>Why oral homework?</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Regardless of class size, language learners 
					and teachers alike usually agree that there is 
					insufficient class time to develop oral skills. 
					Uttering words or producing fluent speech 
					is a huge challenge for a good number of 
					learners—possible reasons include language 
					learning aptitude, language learning anxiety, 
					individual learning style, and general readiness (Mendez 2007; Oxford 1999; Shamim 
					1996; Turula 2002). In very large classes, 
					the chance to be heard by peers or the 
					teacher is substantially reduced because of 
					time constraints, often imposed by learners 
					themselves. Some learners, for example, tend 
					to be pretty hard on themselves and hold 
					off on speaking until they have either flawlessly written down the words or rehearsed 
					them several times on their own. As Gibson 
					(2004), Hawkey (2006), and Littlewood 
					(2001) suggest, by the time students feel 
					ready to speak in front of others it is a 
					few minutes before class is over. In other 
					cases strong competition among peers creates problems because some learners are 
					not willing to wait for less proficient ones 
					to attempt to speak (Breen 2001; Hawkey 
					2006). Fatigue is yet another factor—after 
					five pairs perform identical or very similar 
					conversations students inevitably get restless 
					and want to move on (van Dam 2002).
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Oral homework addresses these problems 
					by allowing every student to produce speech, 
					articulate English sounds, and practice listening skills. It provides equal time for every 
					learner to say something and may well reduce 
					in-class competition among students to speak. 
					While timid learners will benefit from producing the language on their own and at their 
					own pace, more fluent learners can still do 
					what they seem to enjoy the most: speaking 
					and being heard. However, unlike regular 
					homework that might simply consist of a 
					notebook page, oral homework requires some 
					technology to be feasible.

			<section class="subsection" data-number="2" data-name="Required technology for oral homework">

				<h2>Required technology for oral homework</h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Technology plays an important role in 
					recording learners’ oral production, whether 
					it is basic drills, minimal pair exercises, real-time chatting, or online conferencing (Egbert 
					2005; Chinnery 2005). The equipment and 
					media used to record oral performances ranges 
					from tape recorders to computers with the 
					requisite software already loaded or available 
					free on the Internet. However, teachers and 
					students often have to deal with the following 
					limited technology contexts: 
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Teachers and students rely solely on school equipment.</li>

					<li>Teachers can only access school computers with unreliable connections.</li>

					<li>Teachers and students only have access to dial-up connections at home. </li>

					<li>Overhead projectors in classrooms have no Internet connection.</li>

					<li>Computer rooms are not set up exclusively for language learning.</li>

					<li>Self-access centers are booked for most of the term.</li>

					<li>Email accounts do not have capacity for dozens of audio files sized over 1 MB.</li>

					<li>Campus Wi-Fi is explicitly banned from classroom use.</li>

				<h2>How do I set up oral homework?</h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					The challenge is to learn how to work with 
					whatever equipment is available to record and 
					play oral performances. If there is Internet 
					access, learners can take advantage of a range 
					of possibilities to develop, record, and deliver 
					oral homework using synchronous communication(real-time interaction, such as Instant

					Messaging) and asynchronous communication
					(delayed interaction, such as email). However, 
					it is certainly possible to record and turn in 
					oral homework without an Internet connection.
					One basic option is to record learners’ 
					oral production directly to the computer and 
					either store the digital audio files on the hard 
					drive or transfer them to other media, such 
					as CDs, USB flash drives, or memory cards. 
					If the computer is old or outdated, just make 
					sure it has Windows Media Player, the basic 
					recording software installed on most computers.
					(It can be downloaded at www.microsoft.
					com/windows/windowsmedia.) Finally, to 
					transfer recorded audio files to other media, 
					the computer must burn/write CDs or have 
					a USB port. 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					I suggest you carry out the following six 
					steps at the beginning of your course. Not 
					only will it help you get to know your learners,
					but it will also get them involved in the 
					process. However, it is a good idea to get 
					familiar with the technical details before meeting
					your students. Doing so with a novice 
					colleague who is also learning is really helpful, 
					as is enlisting the aid of knowledgeable family 
					members or friends.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 1: Make sure learners have access to recording devices</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					You may have a computer room available 
					in your school to record, or students may 
					have the means to do it at home. Recording 
					options include personal computers, tape 
					recorders, or mobile phones (Chinnery 2006). 
					Tape recorders may be easy to use and carry, 
					but they may be out of date or unavailable to 
					some learners. Digital recorders are another 
					option, although they can be prohibitively 
					expensive. In some teaching contexts cell 
					phones are more available than fully equipped 
					classrooms with the latest in computing 
					and educational technology. Many students 
					already carry a laptop computer with them, 
					which most likely includes basic, one-minute 
					audio recording software or Windows Media 
					Player. In this case, students might just need 
					to purchase an inexpensive microphone to 
					start recording.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The option I most frequently use at the 
					recording stage is the students’ own cell 
					phones, which is a very convenient option in 
					my context. Students may not even be aware 
					that their cell phones come with an audio 
					recording tool that records for at least 60 
					seconds. This recording tool allows students 
					to use their phones as simple tape recorders, 
					and they do not have to use their minutes to 
					record themselves. To transfer the recordings 
					from their phones to a computer, learners can 
					use the phone’s existing Bluetooth wireless 
					technology or a USB data cable that comes 
					with most cell phones. Some phones have a 
					data memory card that can be used to transfer 
					files by plugging the card directly into a computer’s
					memory card slot (if it has one) or by 
					using a memory card reader that connects to 
					the computer’s USB port. Once transferred to 
					the computer, audio files from the phone can 
					be stored and played.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 2: Set up or agree on a format</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Audio recordings come in different formats, 
					which refers to the way sound is encoded onto 
					a file. Unfortunately, different formats are not 
					always compatible with each other, although 
					an incompatible format can be converted to 
					a compatible one. This will require access to 
					a high-speed broadband connection, at least 
					for one computer, to obtain free downloads 
					from the Internet to run the conversion programs.
					For example, many cell phones record 
					in an AMR format that may be difficult to 
					play with certain basic audio software or on 
					outdated computers. Other cell phones record 
					audio in MP3 format (which runs in Real 
					One Player: www.real.com) or in less popular 
					formats such as MOV (which runs in Quick 
					Time Player: www.apple.com/quicktime).
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					An excellent solution is to ask students to 
					convert audio files to a format everyone can 
					use. For example, if you only have access to 
					Windows Media Player you can ask students 
					to convert their audio files to WMA format, 
					or if you only have Real One Player you can 
					ask them to convert the files to MP3 format. 
					Some teachers may prefer to have students 
					make audio CDs that can be listened to on 
					a CD player, in which case the audio files 
					will be automatically converted to the CDA 
					format. Ask students, colleagues, or family
					members to help you choose an audio 
					file converter; there are a good number of 
					free conversion programs available on the 
					Internet:

					<li>http://en.softonic.com/s/sony-ericsson-amr-converter:phones</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="bodytext">
					These programs typically have detailed 
					instructions and tutorials to help users with 
					the free downloading and conversion process. 
					If necessary, ask for help from colleagues, students,
					friends, or family members if you feel 
					unsure about doing it on your own—most of 
					us need help when it comes to technology.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 3: Supervise students the first time they record</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					It is crucial to check that students are 
					capable of completing a recording task for 
					homework. It is simply not fair to assign a task 
					that they do not have the ability to perform. 
					You should, for instance, make sure they have 
					access to school facilities to record. Book the 
					room in advance and talk to the staff to make 
					sure students will be allowed to use it for the 
					purposes of your assignment. If most of your 
					students bring laptops or cell phones to class 
					you can easily ask them to record something 
					right in the room.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					First, have learners do a rehearsal of the 
					activity without recording. Preferably, carry 
					out a regular oral exercise in pairs, such as 
					a role play, an information gap, or another 
					activity. Then ask students to record themselves
					as they repeat the activity. This will very 
					likely turn the recording exercise into a shared 
					task among learners. In addition, you will see 
					that the quality of sound will force many students
					to speak louder and more clearly, especially those
					who usually speak very quietly. As 
					is often the case, teachers want certain learners 
					to raise their voice enough so that classmates 
					can hear what they say, and if students monitor their
					voice volume it adds to the potential 
					benefits of this exercise. Some fluent students 
					will want to start over several times and even 
					ask you to let them record again because they 
					are not happy with how their work came 
					out. In case they do not ask you to let them 
					do it again, ask them if they have listened to 
					the recording and if they think it is ready to 
					hand in. Then tell them they can do it again 
					if necessary.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Students rarely think their recordings are 
					perfect and will do it again. This is advantageous
					for teachers who want learners to spend 
					some time rehearsing new words or structures; 
					students wantingto do things over and over 
					can be an ideal scenario. Some learners will 
					not want other people’s voices or background 
					noise to appear in their recordings, so doing 
					homework at home, in quieter surroundings, 
					will be more appealing. This supervision session
					will give you a good idea of how students 
					will react to listening to and having others 
					listen to their own speech, and will provide 
					important feedback on their proficiency levels 
					and language areas that need improvement.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 4: Set up guidelines for handing in homework</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					For their first oral homework assignment 
					let learners know what equipment, format, 
					and media are acceptable. As a teacher you 
					may be in a position to decide what you feel 
					more comfortable with, either because you 
					will be the one listening to their work or 
					because you have to make sure they all can 
					listen to each other’s recordings. If no Internet 
					access is available, teachers can ask students 
					to turn in their computer recordings on USB 
					flash drives, memory cards, or even audiotapes 
					and CDs.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					If you are able to rely on access to high-speed broadband connections you can ask 
					students to email audio files or upload them 
					to a shared platform they are familiar with. 
					The following free email providers offer free 
					storage and/or group sites that can be created 
					for your class:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Windows Live SkyDrive storage (http://windowslive.com/online/skydrive).</li>

					<li>Windows Live groups (http://groups.live.com). </li>

					<li>Yahoo groups (http://groups.yahoo.com). </li>

					<li>Google groups (http://groups.google.com). </li>
				</ul>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The group sites clearly describe how to set 
					up and use the site for storing and sharing text 
					and multimedia, including audio files.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					As with regular homework, ask learners to 
					properly label their work before they hand it 
					in. Whether students’ audio files are emailed, 
					sent by Bluetooth, uploaded to a group site, 
					or handed in on portable media such as 
					CDs or memory cards, it is critical that you
				</p>

				<div class="pagebreak">
					<p><strong>ENGLISH TEACHING FORUM |</strong> NUMBER 3 2010</p>

					<p><span class="pagenumber">13</span></p>
					
					<div class="clear"></div>
				</div>

<!-- Page 14 -->

				<p>
					train them to label each file uniquely and 
					include their names. This will prevent receiving numerous
					audio files all named “home-work1.mp3.” Finally, printed guidelines are 
					useful to remind yourself and students when 
					assignments are due, how you expect them 
					to be handed in, and what the feedback and 
					grading criteria are.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 5: Allow students enough time to hand in their work</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Even though students may be good at 
					using technology, they will still need extra 
					time to get used to the idea of recording 
					themselves. Quiet learners are likely to feel 
					nervous, and more proficient ones may dislike
					how they sound and end up recording as 
					many times as less confident learners. In my 
					experience, learners who hand in oral homework
					tend to dedicate a good deal of time; 
					in fact, several students have handed in CDs 
					containing between 5 and 12 audio files. One 
					of those audio files, not necessarily the last 
					one, is labeled as “homerwork1paty,” “this_is_
					the_good_one,” or something similar.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					If you assign dialogues or role plays, 
					learners will need to meet after class to 
					complete the homework. They will most 
					likely practice, record, evaluate, rerecord, 
					agree when it is ready, convert files if necessary,
					and transfer files to a previously agreed 
					media, like a USB flash drive, a memory 
					card, or a CD. I usually give students a week 
					after a supervised recording to hand in their 
					first oral assignment.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 6: Space out the frequency of recordings</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					This may be the first time you ask for oral 
					homework, so start small and be realistic. The 
					first time you receive your learners’ audio files 
					you may be so excited to hear the ever silent 
					students speak that you will want to listen to 
					them all and give detailed feedback to each 
					one. I suggest you simply listen to all of them 
					but refrain from grading. This will help you 
					make informed decisions about your next 
					assignments. Allow yourself enough time to 
					give recordings back before you assign students a new task.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Make sure that the oral homework matches the
					objectives at each stage of the course; 
					in addition, consider the curriculum to determine
					the best occasions for oral homework. 
					Decide if you would like to ask for oral homework
					in place of other assignments, or if you 
					are willing to receive both written and oral 
					homework assignments and to what degree. 
					If you are familiar with the students’ calendar 
					and know when they are busier, try to program
					the due dates of your oral assignments 
					at times when their workload is not as heavy. 
					North and Pillay (2002) recommend that 
					teachers not overload students with assignments
					or overwhelm themselves with endless grading,
					even in contexts where teacher 
					feedback is perceived to have more value than 
					peer feedback.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The number of students is also another factor
					that will help you determine the 
					amount of recordings you can ask for during 
					the course, and whether you will have learners 
					work in groups or do recordings individually. 
					Usually, I ask for three or four recordings 
					apiece when I have 20 to 25 students and 
					four when I have fewer than 20  students. 
					Some of these recordings are done individually
					and the students pair up for others. As a 
					general rule I ask for one recording for every 
					20  hours of teaching, even with classes of 
					up to 45  students. This is possible because I 
					group students in triads at the beginning of 
					the course when they are more available, and 
					then in pairs later in the course.

			<section class="subsection" data-number="4" data-name="What can I set up as oral homework?">

				<h2>What can I set up as oral homework?</h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Almost anything learners are asked to do 
					orally in class can be converted into an oral 
					homework task. For example, if learners will 
					repeat model sentences to exercise intonation, a
					possible oral assignment could ask: 
					“Record the following 8 to 10 emphatic sentences
					showing surprise.” As another assignment, student
					pairs develop dialogues that 
					contain specified vocabulary and are asked 
					to do the following: “Role play the dialogue 
					with your partner, exaggerate the highlighted 
					expressions, exchange roles and record again.” 
					Another popular activity consists of having 
					learners create the middle or end of an incomplete
					story with the instruction: “Record the 
					last sentence in the unfinished text and then 
					tell us how the story ends.”
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Oral production tasks in the classroom can 
					also be less dependent on prescribed scripts 
					and allow for more open-ended student creativity.

			<section class="subsection" data-number="5" data-name="Additional options for oral homework">					

				<h2>Additional options for oral homework</h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					There are a plethora of possible options to 
					consider for oral homework. Depending on 
					the available resources, the number and type 
					of learners per group, your own workload and, 
					perhaps more importantly, what you would 
					like students to achieve from completing oral 
					homework, you can consider some of the following
					options for assigning oral homework. 
					(See the Appendix for a summary of oral 
					homework tasks.)
				</p>

				<p><strong>Individual work vs. pair or group work</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Setting up oral assignments that entail 
					group work extends the amount of time 
					your learners interact among themselves 
					(Gibson 2004). Dialogues, role plays, and 
					information gap activities are an excellent 
					oral activity for students to record. Besides 
					developing communication skills, student 
					interaction helps shy learners participate 
					more easily in a group; this type of integration
					is crucial for any task that you assign 
					students to do together (Littlewood 2001; 
					Malamah-Thomas 1987; Strehorn 2001). 
					However, this means students must make 
					themselves available to meet after class. Also, 
					some students may feel unprepared to be 
					heard so closely by peers—in the classroom, 
					learners who produce the language in small 
					groups are somehow sheltered by all the 
					noise around them; producing the language 
					in more intimate situations might actually 
					overwhelm a few of them (Mendez 2007; 
					Oxford 1999; van Dam 2002). Clearly, one 
					major advantage of grouping learners is the 
					fewer number of assignments to be graded, 
					which would be at least twice as many if 
					learners worked individually. On the other 
					hand, to make sure learners produce as 
					much language in pairs as when they work 
					individually, an extended amount of recording
					material must be available. Many of my 
					individual oral assignments last between 1 
					and 1.5 minutes, while pair oral assignments 
					last between 2 and 2.5 minutes.
				</p>

				<p><strong>An existing script vs. an original script</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					You can choose to either give students 
					an existing script or cards they can use to 
					develop their own spoken exchange to be 
					recorded (Cáceres and Obilinovic 2000; 
					Zacarian 2009). Similarly, students can 
					record an existing profile of a famous athlete 
					or write up their own profile of a favorite 
					athlete to record. Something in between is 
					also possible, such as giving beginners a picture
					story to describe or an existing dialogue 
					or text for them to modify in previously 
					agreed places.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Some learners enjoy the exercise more when 
					they record something they have written, like 
					stating their point of view about something or 
					describing their lifestyles, dreams, and ambitions.
					Yet these learners also acknowledge that 
					an existing script makes it easier to produce 
					language fluently. Again, what you would like 
					your learners to get out of recording themselves
					will help you determine which option 
					suits you best. For example, if you want students
					to give voice to something they wrote, 
					a self-created script may be appropriate, but 
					if you want them to work on pronouncing 
					specific words or features of the language, 
					an existing script containing those elements 
					is called for (Tanner and Landon 2009). If 
					you are still not sure, it may be a good idea 
					to begin with an existing script and introduce 
					self-created scripts later.

				<p><strong>Teacher decides what to record vs. students decide what to record</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Some learners want freedom to choose 
					what to record while others are not ready to 
					decide for themselves or unconsciously pick 
					the most simple tasks. In most cases it is 
					important to have homework closely relate to 
					course content and objectives. If, for instance, 
					one of your modules deals with common 
					health problems, a doctor/patient role play 
					fulfills the learning objective. Each student 
					pair could record the same health-related role 
					play or you could have students do separate 
					health-related role plays on a variety of topics, 
					such as a headache, a cold, a swollen ankle, a 
					toothache, or a sunburn. The teacher distributes
					the role play or learners choose from a 
					list. While the latter is more comfortable for 
					learners who are reluctant to create something 
					from scratch, they are still challenged by 
					thinking about what task suits them best. 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Your unit on transportation, for example, 
					could contain the following instructions: 
				</p>

				<p class="journal">
					Choose your role play from the following 
					five options.
				</p>
					
				<ol>
					<li>
						Role play a dialogue between two 
						friends who have to decide on one out 
						of three transport alternatives to get to 
						a monument in town.
					</li>

					<li>
						Discuss with your partner how to purchase
						the best option of plane tickets 
						from New York to Los Angeles.
					</li>

					<li>			
						You are standing at Speakers’ Corner in 
						Hyde Park: Give a 1.5-minute speech 
						on why we should ban cars from 
						downtowns.
					</li>

					<li>
						Discuss together the seriousness of the 
						traffic problems where you live.
					</li>

					<li>
						What do you think transport will be 
						like in 10 years? Make your predictions.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Depending on the course content and 
					what you want students to get out of doing 
					oral homework assignments, you can choose 
					among easier closed or more challenging open 
					options, realizing the tasks requiring deeper 
					reflection about important issues are likely to 
					improve student readiness for autonomous 
					learning (Hedge 2000).

				<h2>Collecting recordings and giving feedback</h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					At some point, even if you have planned 
					for a highly structured session in which learners
					listen to each other’s work and offer peer 
					feedback, try making enough time to comfortably
					sit and listen to all first-time recordings.
					Listening to learners is time consuming 
					and it is likely to make you feel tired the first 
					time you do it. Perhaps the most rewarding 
					aspect is that you will get to hear those students
					who seldom speak.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Keep an eye on your watch and time yourself.
					This will help you decide what changes 
					to institute the next time you assign the same 
					task. Take advantage of your experience grading
					regular homework and give yourself the 
					chance to find a system for you to work at 
					your best. For example, you may want to first 
					make sure you have everyone’s assignments 
					and note whose is missing, and then determine
					if you can listen to the audio files; in 
					some cases you will have to notify students of 
					technical problems.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Feedback should correlate with what you 
					want your learners to get out of recording. 
					In role plays, for example, it is important to 
					assess the degree students becomethe character
					and act with enthusiasm; feedback should 
					specifically assess the objective of following 
					a specific intonation when they record their 
					lines (Celce-Murcia, Brinton, and Goodwin 
					1996; Dalton and Seidlhofer 1994; Tanner 
					and Landon 2009).
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					It is important to make sure your first feedback
					is encouraging and cheerful, especially if 
					learners have never recorded themselves. Try 
					to include a self-assessment component to 
					help you decide how you can evaluate their 
					next assignment. This is also very useful to 
					make students feel positive about repeating 
					the task. Written feedback may be quick, but 
					initially recording your oral feedback may be 
					the most appropriate.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					I also suggest you keep assessment criteria 
					simple and straightforward when you initially 
					assign oral homework, and that students react 
					to their classmates’ work rather than evaluate. 
					For example, if all groups record a role play 
					about an upcoming trip to a famous city, you 
					could ask them: “Listen to another group’s 
					plan. Which one do you like best, yours or 
					theirs? Why?” For assignments where they 
					record different scripts, you could instruct 
					learners to “Listen to your classmates’ conversations.
					What did the doctor recommend?” 
					or “Listen to your classmates’ jokes. Rate

					them with 5 stars if you laughed a lot,” or 
					something similar. Team up students from 
					the first recording so that they get used to 
					the idea of being heard by others as quickly 
					as possible. Asking them to listen to another 
					group’s recordings at this stage will encourage 
					empathetic feedback later.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Some students may be reluctant to do oral 
					homework because they cannot meet peers 
					after class, prefer working alone, or object to 
					others listening to their work. You must be 
					prepared for such scenarios and decide whether 
					you will want oral homework to be a percent-age of students’ grades. If you do, I suggest you 
					start small and see how it works. Learners who 
					do not produce recordings can still be included 
					in the feedback sessions and you can keep 
					checking to see if they want to participate in 
					the next assignment. Just like every other new 
					element you incorporate into your teaching, 
					oral homework will definitely open new doors 
					to your professional development.

			<section class="subsection" data-number="7" data-name="Conclusion">

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Oral homework is an excellent option to 
					give students an equal amount of time and 
					opportunity for oral production and feedback. 
					Recording tasks can range from exercising 
					intonation patterns to telling an original story. 
					Learners can exercise various levels of decision 
					making and gravitate toward more autono-mous learning.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Oral homework is largely possible even in 
					a limited technology context without access 
					to the Internet. Although some students may 
					be unable to do oral homework because they 
					lack the means to record audio files, giving 
					options is what works best. For example, I 
					have accepted regular audiocassettes and video 
					files (or even older formats like VHS or 8mm) 
					where students direct the camera to a blank 
					spot while their voices are being recorded. 
					Other students have used the voice record-ing options in PowerPoint software (Egbert 
					2005), and some others have given me their 
					tape recorders or MP3 players to take home. 
					It has been exceptionally rewarding to see 
					how students work out ways to hand in their 
					work. As a result, I have found oral homework 
					assignments a fertile field for learner integra-tion and interaction, problem solving skills, 
					and creativity.
