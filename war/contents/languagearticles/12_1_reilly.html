				<h1>Understanding and Teaching Generation Y</h1>

				<p class="firstletter _12one">E</p>

				<p class="firstpagebody1 _12one">
					nglish teaching professionals 
					working with children in primary
					school, adolescents in 
					secondary school, or adults at university
					know that learners nowadays think 
					and behave differently than those from 
					previous generations. These students 
					were born into a world of information 
					technology; they prefer to multitask 
					rather than focus on one thing at a 
					time, and they can be more attracted 
					to the ideas of a peer or a web video 
					than what their teachers have to offer. 
					This generation has been given different
					names, including Net Gen, 
					the Millennials, and Generation Y 
					(McCrindle Research 2006).
				</p>

				<p class="firstpagebody2 _12one">
					There is no precise time frame 
					about when Generation Y—also 
					called “Gen Y”—came into being; 
					some researchers indicate it began 
					in 1977, some suggest 1980 (Lancaster
					and Stillman 2002), and others 
					say 1982 (Wessels and Steenkamp 
					2009). In spite of these differences, 
					there is no doubt that Gen Y makes 
					up a significant part of the world’s 
					population—20 percent, according to 
					NAS Recruitment Communications 
					(2006). Because Gen Y’s members are 
					young, it is fair to say that most English
					as a Second/Foreign Language 
					(ESL/EFL) learners belong to this 
					cohort, making it worthy of teachers’ 
					attention and understanding.
				</p>

				<p class="firstpagebody2 _12one">
					Not surprisingly, the majority of 
					research and reports in the media 
					about Gen Y comes from developed 
					nations, specifically the United States. 
					However, the examination of Gen Y is 
					on the rise at universities throughout 
					the world, including in countries such 
					as Mexico (Casteñeda et al. 2011), 
					South Africa (Wessels and Steenkamp 
					2009), Costa Rica (Pérez, Aguilar, 
					and Víquez 2007), and New Zealand 
					(New Zealand Herald2010). While 
					Gen Y receives substantial attention 
					in the professional literature of many 
					fields, this is not true of ELT journals. 
					This lack of attention is unfortunate 
					because most English language learners
					are Gen Yers. This article will 
					address this gap by informing ELT 
					professionals about the nature of Gen 
					Y and presenting a few teaching strategies
					designed to engage this generation
					in the English classroom.

				<h2>Survey of the generations</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Lancaster and Stillman (2002) provide a 
					historical perspective of Gen Y by dividing 
					the last 70 years into four distinct generations.
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<em>The Baby Boomer generation</em> (1946–
						1964). This large generation was due to 
						the many soldiers who returned home 
						after World War II and started families. 
						More people were born in this twenty-year period than at any other time in 
						United States history.
					</li>

					<li>
						<em>Generation X</em> (1965–1980). This generation
						was much smaller than the 
						Boomer generation. Gen Xers have 
						been generally characterized as hard 
						working, independent, and skeptical.
					</li>

					<li>
						<em>Generation Y</em> (1981–1999). This generation
						came into being during the 
						last two decades of the 20th century. 
						Its members are identified as confident 
						and technologically advanced, and they 
						come with a sense of entitlement.
					</li>

					<li>
						<em>Generation Z</em> (2000–present). This 
						name refers to those born since 2000, a 
						group that has received little attention 
						in the literature thus far.

				<h2>Gen Y at work</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Professionals from various fields—including
					accounting, law, and medicine, to name 
					just a few—have written increasingly about 
					generational differences and the implications
					of those differences in the workplace. 
					Lindquist (2008), for example, compared the 
					values of Gen Y accountants with those from 
					the previous two generations and found that 
					today’s employees are more concerned about 
					what their employer can do for them, rather 
					than vice versa. Workers of former generations 
					identified “respect for the company’s mission
					statement” as the fifth-most important 
					reason to join a company. Gen Y does not 
					even consider a company’s mission in their 
					top ten reasons to accept a job offer. As their 
					number one reason to join a company, Gen Y 
					cites “professional growth opportunities”—in 
					other words, “What can this company do for 
					me?” Another difference is that Gen Y values 
					comfort at work more than previous generations
					have. Reasons four and six for joining a 
					company are “comfortable office atmosphere” 
					and “flexible work schedule,” respectively 
					(Linquist 2008, 58). Erickson (2008) adds 
					that they are not willing to sacrifice their 
					lives for work (as previous generations have), 
					but instead seek a balance between work and 
					personal life. As explained by Herbison and 
					Boseman (2009), these differences may even 
					give rise to conflict: 
				</p>

				<p class="journal">
					The situation with the Gen Y workforce 
					is simmering, and it is about to come 
					to a full boil. If we [employers] look 
					forward to the opportunity, embrace 
					the unique skills of Gen Y, and learn 
					from them, we will succeed. If we cling 
					to “what has always worked,” the Millennials
					will look elsewhere for their 
					employment opportunities. (34)
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Articles in many professional journals pertain
					to how human resource departments are 
					developing strategies to recruit and retain talented
					members of Gen Y. Can educators, and 
					specifically ELT professionals, take the hint 
					from other professions and apply strategies to 
					engage Gen Y in the classroom?

				<h2>Gen Y at school</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Educators have also discussed the nature 
					of Gen Y and the challenges that they bring 
					to the classroom. Evidently, the “old way” 
					of schooling, namely the teacher as “sage on 
					the stage,” is not effective with Gen Y (Skiba 
					2008). Experienced teachers who have been 
					around a while know that the values today’s 
					students hold are not congruent with traditional
					course content and methods. Teachers 
					who merely follow the textbook are likely to 
					be perceived as “old hat.” Therefore, teacher 
					effectiveness depends on the ability to adapt 
					instruction to the needs of today’s learners. 
					In his book <em>Educating the Net Generation: 
					How to Engage Students in the 21st Century</em>, 
					Pletka (2007) writes that a significant number 
					of American youth drop out of high school 
					in part because they feel disengaged in the 
					classroom. Considering that jobs in the future 
					will increasingly require a college education, 
					dropouts are in for a difficult time.

				<p class="bodytext">
					In a similar vein, a survey that I carried out 
					with 100 middle school students in my home 
					state of Aguascalientes, Mexico, revealed that 
					only 25 percent of EFL teachers include 
					Internet-based activities in class or for homework.
					Another survey question revealed that 
					71 percent of the students describe their English
					class as “boring” or “very boring.” These

					results are not surprising because while young 
					people spend significant time in front of the 
					screen at home, public schools in Mexico 
					have limited funds to acquire the technology 
					for classrooms. The question arises: How can 
					teachers compete with the stimulating entertainment
					that their students get at home?

				<p class="bodytext">
					The rest of this article will focus on characteristics
					of Gen Y as presented in journals, 
					mostly from outside of ELT, and also advance 
					some logical strategies for English teachers
					to experiment with to better engage this 
					generation. Answers to two questions will 
					be explored: (1) What should teachers know 
					about the nature of Gen Y? and (2) What 
					strategies could enhance ELT effectiveness?

			<section class="subsection" data-number="4" data-name="Gen Y is tech-savvy">

				<h2>Gen Y is tech-savvy</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The most salient characteristic of this generation
					is its comfort with technology. Prensky 
					(2001) refers to them as digital natives, or 
					people born into a technological world. He 
					contrasts them with digital immigrants, those 
					of us who remember a world prior to PCs, 
					cell phones, and video games. In other words, 
					today’s youth have never known life without 
					computers and the Internet, and therefore see 
					information technology as an integral part of 
					their lives. It is not uncommon to see news 
					reports on the increasing time that children are 
					spending in front of computer screens at home.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					A survey of 277 first-year British university
					students exemplifies this generation’s 
					thirst for technology. Sandars and Morrison 
					(2007) discovered that not only are learners 
					experienced with tools such as wikis, blogs, 
					and chat rooms, but more importantly, they 
					believe that these tools can benefit their learning
					in school. Oblinger (2003) adds that this 
					generation seeks immediate information and 
					understanding from the web and videos, 
					not by looking through a textbook. This is 
					substantiated by reports from different parts 
					of the world that describe how an increasing 
					number of students are opting to take online 
					courses rather than trekking to classes (Polimeni,
					Burke, and Benyaminy 2009).
				</p>

				<p><strong>Teaching strategies for tech-savvy students</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					ELT professionals have identified many 
					useful ways to bring new technology into the 
					classroom, including creating wikis; using 
					WebQuests; implementing video-based activities
					through sites such as YouTube; incorporating
					video games and blogs; and making use 
					of instant messages. Last semester, teachers in 
					our university language department read about 
					these activities in Peachey’s (2009) Web 2.0
					—which is available online for free—and 
					Sharma and Barrett’s (2007) text on blended 
					learning. These two sources alone offer teachers
					many leads on how to include technology 
					in their classes. Apparently, an essential question
					for teachers about classroom behavior has 
					evolved from “How can I keep my students 
					from using electronic devices in class?” to 
					“How can I use e-tools to get and keep my 
					students motivated?”
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					It is important to mention here that teachers
					need regular encouragement and guidance
					about how to use new technologies. 
					PowerPoint, for example, is popular software 
					that can promote interaction and learning. 
					However, for new users who lack the proper 
					training, its menus, options, and icons can 
					be daunting. And once teachers have learned 
					how to create a presentation, they must also 
					learn how to incorporate it into their class in 
					a way that Gen Y will find engaging. 
					Interestingly, younger teachers are often 
					better demonstrators of technology at teacher 
					meetings, and they can even become the 
					mentors of older teachers who are trying to 
					assimilate technology into their classrooms.

				<p><strong>Gen Y balances personal and work lives</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					A second characteristic of today’s students 
					is that they do not demonstrate the same 
					work ethic as did previous generations (Manly 
					and Thomas 2009). They value comfort and 
					informality over rules and deadlines. Yet it 
					would benefit teachers to reflect on the life 
					experience of this generation. Gen Y witnessed,
					all too often, that their Gen X parents 
					sacrificed to move up the company ladder and 
					showed great loyalty to their employers, only 
					to wind up stressed out, suffering through a 
					broken marriage, or laid off due to downsizing
					(Eisner 2005). Gen Y, therefore, prefers to 
					work smarter rather than harder. They believe 
					they can because technology makes them 
					more efficient. Information and knowledge 
					are readily available to them via the Internet, 
					allowing them to complete projects faster. 
					This generation believes it can outperform 
					previous ones without paying such a high 
					personal price. The bottom line: employers

					and teachers need to accept this cohort’s new 
					mindset. Gen Y will not return to past ways of 
					being; their life experience has been different. 
					In Prensky’s (2001, 1) words, “Today’s students
					are no longer the people our educational 
					system was designed to teach.”
				</p>	

				<p><strong>Teaching strategies to balance personal and work lives</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					First, teachers need to stop resenting students’
					apparent lackadaisical attitude and get 
					on with the task of learning how to engage 
					them. In other words, teachers and schools 
					need to understand the nature of this generation
					and adopt teaching strategies that work 
					with them; otherwise, students will feel bored 
					and learning will be minimized.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Here is one way I try to better engage my 
					university students. Every two or three weeks 
					of the course, I write three questions on the 
					board and ask students to discuss them among 
					themselves. I then step out of the room for ten 
					minutes. The questions are: 
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>What	do	you	like	about	the	course?</li>

					<li>What	do	you	dislike?</li>

					<li>What	can	Peter	do	to	be	a	better	teacher?</li>
				</ul>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					I ask one student to be a secretary and 
					write down the most important comments 
					that come up. If students want to comment in 
					their first language, they may do so. When I 
					reenter the room, the secretary reads the comments
					to me in front of the class. I respond by 
					explaining how I can adjust the course or my 
					teaching in accordance with their suggestions. 
					It is fair to add here that not all teachers will 
					be comfortable trying this technique, or it 
					may not be appropriate in certain cultures. 
					However, my experience in Mexico has been 
					that students appreciate being listened to and 
					even having the opportunity to influence certain
					aspects of the course.

				<p><strong>Gen Y individuals are kinesthetic and visual learners</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Human resource departments in today’s 
					firms have discovered the value of simulation 
					software to recruit and train Gen Y (Skiba 
					2008). Simulations of the real world, or 
					“virtual reality,” engage and motivate Gen Y 
					because they are visual and involve learning 
					by doing. According to Polimeni, Burke, and 
					Benyaminy (2009, 66), employers realize that 
					“if they want to appeal to this technologically 
					savvy generation, they will need to dramatically
					change the way they market the account-ing profession.” It begs the question: Don’t 
					teachers need to change as well?
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Similarly, in the field of education, Faust et 
					al. (2001) describe the mismatch between Gen 
					Y’s learning styles and their instructors’ teaching
					styles. She modified the teaching methods 
					and materials being used in a university computer
					course to make them more attractive for 
					today’s students. Her research suggests that 
					students prefer kinesthetic and visual learning 
					activities over traditional teacher-centered and 
					text-based tasks. McCrindle Research (2006) 
					reported on research with Australian students 
					and found 52 percent prefer to learn kinesthetically
					and 42 percent visually, while just 
					6 percent are primarily auditory learners.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Teaching strategies for kinesthetic and visual learners</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					To increase motivation to learn, we need 
					to get students moving and include visuals 
					in course work. Using concentric circles to 
					exchange information, Find Someone Who… 
					tasks, and rallies get students out of their 
					chairs. PowerPoint presentations, YouTube 
					videos, and student-made posters and drawings
					increase the visual nature of our classes. 
					Here are two activities from my work week. 
					First, each Monday I take a DVD and small 
					TV from my home to use with a group of 
					with five twelve-year-olds. I start and stop an 
					action-packed video and ask the students to 
					write sentences based on what they have seen. 
					They write, and then they exchange notebooks
					to check and correct their classmates’ 
					sentences. They also perform skits based on 
					the segments. Second, at the university, I dedicate
					ten to twelve minutes each Wednesday 
					to a song. A different student selects the song 
					each week and prepares a cloze handout for 
					the class. The student pauses the song, checking
					that all students have heard correctly. I 
					always ask the student why he or she selected 
					that particular song.

				<p><strong>Gen Y is feedback-dependent</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Gen Y has received significant doses of 
					feedback from many sources throughout their 
					lives. It started with parents who “helped 
					them plan their achievements, took part in 
					their activities, and showed strong beliefs in 
					their child’s worth” (NAS Recruitment Com-

					munications 2006, 1), making Gen Y the 
					most child-centered generation in history. 
					When they attended after-school activities, 
					teachers and coaches offered them a humanistic,
					empowering learning environment. At 
					the same time, frequent instant messages and 
					hours spent in chat rooms have made today’s 
					students sensitive to peers’ opinions. Perhaps 
					the most intense feedback has come from 
					video games and the Internet, which offer 
					immediate results.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Teaching strategies for feedback-dependent learners</strong></p>
				
				<p class="bodytext">
					How can English teachers respond to their 
					students’ need for feedback? First, teachers 
					need to explicitly express what students need 
					to do to learn better. Gen Y does not respond 
					to reprimand. Instead, this generation prefers 
					sincere concern on the part of teachers, who 
					can provide this in the form of non-blameful 
					I-messages to the whole group or an individual
					(e.g., “When you speak Spanish in class 
					with the person next to you, I feel uncomfortable
					because it is more difficult for you to 
					learn English”).
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Error correction is a second type of feed-back
					we offer students. Normally, we have 
					been trained to use different techniques such 
					as recasting, clarification request, and meta-linguistic
					cues to correct individual students. 
					What we need to keep in mind is that the 
					more we encourage learners to discover their 
					own mistakes and those of peers, the more 
					active they are in the learning process and, 
					therefore, the more appropriate the process 
					is for Gen Y. This cohort prefers to have 
					time to think about and generate the correct 
					form rather than having the teacher supply 
					it. Mindful of these insights, perhaps the 
					most time-efficient way the teacher can give 
					feedback involves first jotting down common 
					mistakes heard during pair and group work. 
					Then, at the end of class, she writes the incorrect
					language on the board and asks students 
					to think for a moment and then identify (and 
					correct) the mistake.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Another strategy to offer feedback involves 
					digitally recording students. Many teachers 
					have had the experience of being filmed and 
					subsequently asked by a head teacher to study 
					the recording to learn how aspects of their 
					teaching affect learning. For the past three 
					years, I have turned the camera on students 
					and discovered that it is an equally valuable 
					tool for them. Here is how it works. 
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						First, students prepare a PowerPoint 
						presentation of three to four minutes. 
						The topic could be on a free-time activity
						or a grammar point.
					</li>

					<li>
						Second, on the day of the presentations,
						all the files are saved on a computer
						that is connected to a digital 
						projector. As each student presents, 
						class members evaluate their peer’s talk 
						by using a rubric to assign scores from 
						1 (low) to 4 (high) on elements such 
						as posture, eye contact, tone of voice, 
						clarity of speech, vocabulary, fluency, 
						grammatical accuracy, and overall organization.
						The rubrics are given to the 
						presenter at the end of the talk. This 
						procedure allows the student to receive 
						feedback from his or her peers and the 
						teacher.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						In the following class, a one-minute 
						video segment of each presentation is 
						shown to the class, allowing each student
						to observe him- or herself.
					</li>

					<li>
						Finally, each student writes a reflection 
						paper for homework that summarizes 
						the feedback from peers, the teacher, 
						and self-observation.
					</li>
				</ol>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					I must add that a change in the students’ 
					attitude about this strategy is evident over 
					the course of the semester. At the beginning, 
					learners report that anxiety is high and they 
					do not see the benefit of doing the recordings. 
					After the strategy is repeated two or three 
					times in the semester, students invariably 
					report that they learned from it. Specifically, 
					they report that their anxiety drops with experience
					and that they are able to correct many 
					grammar and pronunciation mistakes.

					Research on what this generation believes

					that only 45 percent of students believe that

				</p>

				<p><strong>Teaching strategies for dealing with academic dishonesty</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Educators have cited several ways to reduce 
					academic dishonesty among Gen Y learners.
					First, institutions need to develop an 
					honor code. Ideally, student input is taken into 
					account to formulate the policies, procedures, 
					and sanctions regarding dishonest behavior. 
					Second, faculty members need to explain 
					behaviors such as plagiarism and institute practices
					to curb inappropriateness, such as encouraging
					students to write drafts of their papers. 
					Regarding exams, test generators are helpful to 
					create different versions of tests. In addition, 
					exams must be carefully proctored, electronic 
					devices should not be allowed in the room, and 
					students can be asked to write a statement on 
					the answer sheet indicating that they did not 
					behave inappropriately during the exam.

				<h2>Gen Y’s predilection for entertainment and games</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Halvorsen (2008) writes that Gen Y listens
					to an iPod on a roller coaster because 
					the roller coaster is not entertaining enough. 
					She discusses the importance of entertainment
					as a motivating factor to get students to

					She encourages teachers to tell jokes, share 
					anecdotes, teach with PowerPoint, distribute 
					handouts of presentations, be expressive, smile

					Games have traditionally been associated

					be perceived as being overly demanding. First, 
					teachers need to experiment with Halvorsen’s 
					(2008) ideas mentioned above and encourage
					students to take an active role in the class 
					activities to maximize their participation. 
					Second, materials developers need to increase 
					the number of digital games that are specifically
					designed for language learning. Hopefully,
					soon publishers will consistently include 
					entertaining digital activities with textbook 
					series. Third, Gen X teachers, who are more 
					time-conscious than their Gen Y students, 
					should try to view games as tools of engagement
					and negotiation: “Sure we can play a 
					game, but first I’d like you to work with a 
					partner to do the activity that I am going to 
					explain now.”
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					One example of how games can promote 
					language learning in a fun way is the Weakest 
					Link Game Showorganized each spring by 
					my language department. To begin the game, 
					all of our university’s English students are 
					given a list of 100 trivia questions to study 
					for two weeks. Then, the teacher of each class 
					holds a contest to identify the two students 
					that best answer the questions. The winners 
					from each class then participate in an online, 
					semi-final round that includes new questions. 
					Eight finalists are identified. At the end of 
					the semester, the final event, attended by several
					hundred people, is held in the university 
					auditorium. A university trivia champion is 
					crowned and awarded an important prize. 
					This semester-long event promotes English 
					study in an entertaining manner.

					accustomed to getting what they want, when 
					they want it. Oftentimes, they are not willing 
					to conform to organizational rules because 
					they view the rules as ineffective. For example, 
					the Gen X and Baby Boomers’ tendency to 
					have face-to-face meetings is viewed as a huge 
					waste of time. Gen Y prefers flexibility in how 
					they do their work, with frequent texting and 
					emails to report on their progress. Today, the 
					number of workers who work from home is 
					on the rise, and managers say that turnover 
					drops by 35 percent when employees have this 
					option and can communicate electronically 
					with supervisors and clients. Similarly, Gen Y 
					learners show a preference for the convenience 
					and flexibility of online courses (Moskal et al. 
					2006).
				</p>

				<p><strong>Teaching strategies to customize tasks</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Lockstep learning does not sit well within 
					the personalized world of Gen Y. Faust et al. 
					(2001) found that when web assignments 
					were customized, university students were 
					more likely to complete their homework and 
					improve on semester exams. Like employers, 
					teachers need to reduce the emphasis on how, 
					when, and where students do their work. 
					Instead, they ought to increase flexibility and 
					focus on the quality of student performance. 
					Researchers have suggested that technol-ogy allows learners to more readily advance 
					at their own pace and receive feedback, as 
					well as demonstrate that they have mastered 
					material (Federation of American Scientists 
					2006). One way to do this in the language 
					class is to give students the option to record 
					and upload their oral presentations to You-Tube rather than have everyone present them 
					in class. 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Multitasking is something most students 
					do at home when completing homework 
					assignments (Herbison and Boseman 2009), 
					and they do it more easily than previous 
					generations. Therefore, teachers ought not 
					to be offended when students attempt to 
					do it in class. At the same time, to alleviate 
					tension on this point, teachers could try the 
					following experiment: At the beginning of 
					the semester, ask students to form two concentric
					circles, with the students in the inner 
					circle facing out and those in the outer circle 
					facing in. Have students in the outer circle 
					hold their cell phone or laptop. Ask the outer 
					circle to have two conversations at the same 
					time, one with the person in front and a second
					with another person in the outer circle. 
					Tell them the topic is “The best teacher you 
					have ever had.” After a couple of minutes, 
					the outer circle can rotate two spaces to the 
					left. This time, students in the outer circle 
					should put down their devices and give full 
					attention to the person in front of them. 
					The topic could be “A person you admire.” 
					Finally, ask students to share how they felt 
					in the two situations. Hopefully, you can 
					draw out that communication and learning 
					are better when students do not divide their 
					attention between class activities and their 
					electronic devices.

				<h2>Gen Y redefines respect</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					For professionals of every generation, 
					being respected in the workplace is a fundamental
					need. Interestingly, however, Gen Y 
					has lost respect for authority figures due to 
					the notorious scandals of politicians, artists, 
					and athletes. In the workplace, their attitude 
					is often misconstrued as “lacking respect, 
					but this is not the case. They are just more 
					forthright and believe that everyone, including
					the boss, has to earn respect” (Wallis 
					2009, 63). Generally, this generation admires 
					family, friends, and people with innovative 
					ideas over people with a title or years in the 
					company. Erickson (2008) reports that 95 
					percent of Gen Y say that they like to spend 
					time with their parents. Further, because this 
					cohort grew up chatting with and text messaging
					friends, they trust their friends more 
					than they trust authorities.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Teaching strategies for the redefinition of respect</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					First, teachers must anticipate that at the 
					beginning of a course, their students may not 
					reflexively hold them in high esteem. Learners 
					have had more interaction with their peers, so 
					there is a prior relationship. Also, the tendency
					to multitask makes it likely that youths will 
					start talking with peers as the teacher initiates 
					and runs learning activities. Teachers should 
					avoid resenting their students for this, and 
					recognize it as a natural expression of Gen Y’s 
					mindset. To counter it, teachers need to hold 
					an open discussion about the importance of 
					listening to each other.

					be sensitive to personal matters that Gen Yers 
					are experiencing. Students of teachers who 
					create a warm, caring environment perform 
					better than students who do not perceive 
					their teachers as caring (Weinberger and 
					McCombs 2003). These authors emphasize 
					that teachers need to maximize an atmosphere
					of learner-centeredness in their classrooms.
					Finally, having learners offer feedback 
					on their classmates’ projects or English proficiency
					is another way to capitalize on the 
					importance of peers.

			<section class="subsection" data-number="12" data-name="Gen Y seeks a purpose and a passion">

				<h2>Gen Y seeks a purpose and a passion</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Gen Y has been told by parents, teachers, 
					and coaches that they can do or be anything 
					they want to. They are confident because they 
					do not fear change, but welcome it. Thus, 
					they have set their sights high, and one aim 
					is to make a difference in the world. For 
					example, they are often concerned that former 
					generations have not taken care of the planet. 
					Erickson (2008) reports that Gen Y job candidates
					inquire during interviews about what 
					the company is doing in terms of community 
					service and/or responding to environmental 
					issues. Lindquist (2008) says that accounting
					firms that wish to attract top talent have 
					initiated projects such as conducting food 
					drives, holding ecological preservation events, 
					and helping out in soup kitchens on holidays.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Teaching strategy for encouraging purpose and passion</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					English language textbooks commonly 
					include at least one unit on saving the planet 
					(e.g., tropical forests) and social issues (e.g., 
					poverty). Gen Y finds these topics interesting
					and worthy of study. Teachers can extend 
					these units by having students investigate a 
					related topic and present what they discover 
					in the form of PowerPoint presentations, posters,
					and role plays. A second valuable strategy 
					involves inviting someone, such as a fellow 
					teacher or community member, to present 
					on an important issue affecting the local area. 
					Third, a song, newspaper clipping, or movie 
					segment involving a world problem can also 
					engage learners. Institution-wide projects also 
					help students feel proud of their school and 
					more engaged in learning. Unfortunately, 
					time-conscious teachers may claim that such 
					projects take their courses off the syllabus 
					track. However, they need to realize that if 
					they do not include projects of this sort, Gen 
					Y may not engage in learning at all.

			<section class="subsection" data-number="13" data-name="Gen Y reads less and less well">

				<h2>Gen Y reads less and less well</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The U.S. Department of Education 
					recently revealed that due to the technological 
					age that Gen Yers have grown up in, they are 
					reading and writing less and doing these activities
					less well (National Endowment for the 
					Arts 2007). These “screenagers” are naturally 
					more visual than textual and therefore show a 
					reduced tendency to read. Block (2004) adds 
					that Gen Y is more drawn to contemporary 
					issues and scenarios in texts, rather than the 
					classics. This does not mean that today’s students
					will never experience the classics, but 
					they should not be pushed early on in reading 
					programs. For extensive reading programs to 
					work, learners need to select what they read.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Teaching strategies to encourage reading</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Teachers need to get highly visual reading 
					material that focuses on modern-day issues 
					into their students’ hands. This is a tall order 
					in EFL scenarios because libraries are often 
					scarce and outdated. Here teachers can do 
					two things to generate reading materials. 
					First, students in higher levels of a program, 
					middle school for example, can be asked to 
					create stories and illustrations of simple books 
					to be donated to primary levels. I saw how 
					one school in Monterrey, Mexico, did this 
					and generated dozens of books for young 
					children. Older students have the satisfaction 
					of creating; younger ones gain access to reading materials.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					A second idea involves teachers surfing the 
					web for stories that are written and published 
					online by children who are native speakers of 
					English. Many youths from English-speaking 
					countries write funny, even inspiring books 
					that include their own drawings. These stories 
					can be printed out and bound and put in a 
					classroom’s reading corner.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					A final note on reading: This generation is 
					more holistic than analytic; therefore, extensive
					reading is likely to be more attractive for 
					them than intensive reading. Let us implement
					the suggestions of extensive reading 
					advocates: make a variety of materials available 
					to students; allow them to select what they 
					want to read; and try to make those materials 
					visually attractive, relevant, and appropriately 
					challenging for learners

<!-- Page 10 -->

				<h2>The teacher's role</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Those of us paid to teach English today 
					may, in fact, form the primary obstacle to Gen 
					Y learning in a way they want to. Sandars and 
					Morrison (2007) explain:
				</p>

				<p class="journal">
					As we see it, the main barrier 
					to implementing such teaching is 
					likely to be not the learners but 
					the educators; there seems reluctance
					among many educators to 
					move away from traditional teaching
					methods … a radical departure 
					from a system that has worked well 
					for a very long time. (87)
				</p>

				<p>
					Why are English teachers reluctant to adapt? 
					It is probably fair to say that many prefer to 
					stay on their current course because it is familiar
					and has reaped some benefits. This attitude 
					is unfortunate because for learning to occur, 
					teachers need to update their teaching strategies.
					They need to adopt more technology-based tasks,
					include visual content, and provide
					the opportunity to be physically active in 
					the classroom. If students are not given ample 
					opportunities to practice and receive feedback,
					then the classroom experience wanes 
					in comparison with learners’ personal lives. 
					The relationship between teacher and student 
					becomes more tenuous, and student interest
					in learning drops. English teachers and 
					administrators must ask themselves how to 
					combine most effectively the value of personal 
					interaction with the glittery attraction of the 
					digital world.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Some teachers might object to this call 
					to change. Why should we teachers adjust 
					to our students’ expectations? Shouldn’t 
					learners have two channels of operation: 
					one that they control in their personal lives, 
					and a second that requires them to complete 
					learning activities that schools and teachers 
					have prepared? This may be true. Teachers 
					and students may need to meet each other 
					halfway. The problem is that often, both 
					parties operate in ways that do not take the 
					needs of the other into account. Perhaps 
					therein lies an essential quality of an effective 
					21st-century language teacher: the ability to 
					reduce students’ sense of entitlement and 
					help them understand that schools are not 
					so responsive and English teachers are not so 
					lenient as they expect.

			<section class="subsection" data-number="15" data-name="Conclusion">

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Writers from a variety of professions have 
					pointed out that Gen Y has different values 
					and needs than previous generations. Lan-guage teachers can benefit from the insights of 
					these writers about the needs of Gen Y. Those 
					needs relate to their customized, digitalized, 
					and visual lives; their attitude toward rules, 
					effort, and honesty; feedback-dependence; 
					redefinition of respect; reduced interest in 
					reading; and their desire to make a differ-ence. Mindful of these characteristics, English 
					teachers need to do two things: (1) pursue an 
					understanding of the nature of Gen Y and 
					(2) adopt teaching strategies that respond to 
					their academic needs.
