				<h1>Twenty Ideas for Using Mobile Phones in the Language Classroom</h1>

				<p class="firstpagebody1 _10three">
					hese days it seems mobile 
					phones are used everywhere 
					by everyone, which leads to 
					the obvious question: How can mobile 
					phone technology support learning 
					in the second language classroom? 
					The answer is “in a number of ways” 
					because mobile phones come with 
					ever-increasing functions that most 
					students are adept at using. In this 
					article I describe 20  practical ways to 
					use mobile phones to support second 
					language learning, both inside and 
					outside the classroom. Most of the 
					activities will work with most mobile 
					phones and do not require special 
					knowledge or additional software or 
					hardware. I will also discuss drawbacks 
					such as cost, increased workload, and 
					other problems that might impact the 
					use of phones in the classroom, and 
					will suggest ways of mitigating them.

					<p class="firstpagebody2 _10three">
						Recent interest in the potential 
						for mobile phones and other portable 
						devices to support learning and teaching
						has been driven by the fact that 
						mobile phones are relatively cheap 
						and increasingly powerful (Chinnery 
						2006; Kukulska-Hulme and Traxler 
						2005). Another benefit is that learners
						are used to working with them, 
						often more so than with computers.
						Thornton and Houser (2003) 
						report that young Japanese learners 
						prefer to use mobile phones for many 
						activities, from emailing to reading 
						books. Research on the use of mobile 
						phones for the delivery of vocabulary 
						materials to English learners in Taiwan
						shows that students enjoy using 
						their phones because of easy access to 
						materials and the ability to practice 
						anytime and anywhere; in addition, 
						some students like the screen size limitations,
						which make the amount of 
						content more manageable than that 
						of other teaching materials (Chen, 
						Hsieh, and Kinshuk 2008).

					an ideal tool to support situated learning 
					theory, which states that learning is more likely 
					to take place when information is contextually
					relevant and can be put to immediate use 
					(Lave and Wenger 1991). For example, second 
					language learners can use mobile technology 
					to access relevant vocabulary and expressions 
					while at a bank opening an account, to look 
					up movie reviews while at the theater, or 
					to discuss weekend plans with an English-speaking
					friend. Since mobile phones are part 
					of students’ everyday routines, they help minimize
					the separation between the classroom and 
					the outside world. Applied linguists agree on 
					little when it comes to theories for explaining 
					language learning, but one thing seems clear—
					more exposure to the target language and more 
					practice, or time on task, explains most of the 
					variation in students’ success. Any tool that 
					can increase students’ access to the language 
					will contribute greatly to their progress.
					Another compelling argument for using 
					mobile phones in the classroom is that they 
					give students control over their own learning. 
					Students control the medium, and teachers, 
					by elaborating how best to use the medium, 
					provide a blueprint for autonomous learning, 
					especially during the wide range of daily social 
					activities where mobile phones are most likely 
					to be used.

				<h2>Preparation</h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Before asking students to pull out their cell 
					phones in class, you need to have a plan. As 
					with any other teaching activity, ask yourself 
					what you are trying to achieve. Are you focusing
					on speaking, listening, reading, writing, 
					or some combination of the four skills? Or do 
					you simply want students to reflect on their 
					language use outside the classroom? Start by 
					identifying a specific teaching objective and 
					then structure a mobile phone activity around 
					that. Ask yourself if there is an added value 
					to using a phone for the activity you have in 
					mind. If there is none, perhaps it is better to 
					find an alternative.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The next step is to take stock of the 
					resources that you have available. There is an 
					enormous range of phone makes and models, 
					and the technology is always advancing. Many 
					of the following ideas will work with all but 
					the most obsolete phones, but some require 
					the use of more recent models. In my own 
					teaching I have sometimes asked students to 
					work together in small groups and share one 
					phone that had the required capabilities.

				<h2>Twenty practical ideas for using mobile phones in the language classroom</h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					The following ideas for using mobile phones 
					for second language learning generally focus on 
					developing the four skills and in many cases 
					integrate speaking with listening and reading 
					with writing. The material and activities can 
					be modified to conform to different syllabi and 
					are easily adaptable for different ages, learning 
					levels, and interests. It is important to note that 
					the names of the features used here may not be 
					the same for all mobile phones.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Idea 1: Use the Notes feature to collect everyday language</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Most mobile phones have a feature that 
					allows them to take notes. Ask students to 
					use this feature to take notes on the English 
					they read or hear outside of school and either 
					present the notes to the class or send them to 
					you as a text message. Instead of giving regular 
					homework, you can ask students to hunt for 
					specific language forms (e.g., common nouns, 
					the past perfect tense, formulaic expressions), 
					and the student who collects the largest number
					of correct samples wins. Learners have a 
					tendency to tune out when a classroom lesson 
					is over; this activity helps circumvent that 
					problem by breaking the boundary between 
					class time and daily activities.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Idea 2: Use the Camera feature to take pictures of text</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					One of the easiest ways to use a mobile 
					phone for learning is to record samples of the 
					target language by taking pictures. Students can 
					take pictures of English text by using the Camera
					feature on their mobile phones. They can 
					then make a collage of the images or upload 
					the pictures to a shared Flickr account (www.
					flickr.com). If students do not have a data connection
					(or if you do not want them to incur 
					data costs), they can transfer the pictures to a 
					computer and upload them from there.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Idea 3: Use free programs to organize language samples</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					An extension to Ideas 1 and 2 is to use a 
					free program like Evernote (www.evernote.
					com) to upload notes and pictures to your
				</p>

				<div class="pagebreak">
					<p><strong>ENGLISH TEACHING FORUM |</strong> NUMBER 3 2010</p>

				<p>
					account (which can be accessed from any 
					computer). One neat feature is that the program
					recognizes words in pictures (such as 
					on billboards or even handwritten notes) and 
					converts it to text, generally very accurately. 
					Students can use this program to organize personal
					notes on their account and share it with 
					a group or the whole class. Different accounts 
					can be exchanged, compared, and discussed 
					in class. Again, to avoid data costs notes could 
					be transferred from the mobile phone to the 
					computer for uploading.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Idea 4: Use the Voice Memo Recorder feature to record language from media outlets</strong>
				</p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Most phones include a memo recording 
					feature that can collect language samples from 
					TV or radio. The students’ collected samples 
					give you an opportunity to analyze the language,
					discuss where they were collected, and 
					provide feedback.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Idea 5: Use the Voice Memo Recorder feature
					to record conversations outside the classroom</strong>
				</p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Students can record interviews or conversations
					they engage in outside the classroom. Obviously
					you will have to consider 
					privacy issues and impress upon learners the 
					importance of obtaining their interlocutors’ 
					permission before they do interviews, either 
					with each other or native speakers. Students 
					can play the interviews and conversations in 
					class for feedback and discussion. I have used 
					this idea to send students on quests to collect 
					information from sources in the community, 
					including from native speakers (Reinders and 
					Lewis 2009). Although we used iPods with 
					a microphone, the same task is now easily 
					accomplished with mobile phones. The principle
					remains the same: try to get students to 
					use the language as much as possible!
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Idea 6: Use the Text Messaging feature to reinforce vocabulary learning</strong>
				</p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					A study by Thornton and Houser (2003) 
					shows that Short Message Service (SMS) text 
					messages can be used to send out vocabulary 
					items at spaced intervals, thus increasing 
					student retention. For example, you could 
					text the words covered in class to encourage 
					students to review them outside the school 
					context. By sending out the words multiple 
					times, you increase the chances that students 
					will remember them.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Idea 7: Use free programs to make flashcards for mobile phones</strong>
				</p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					If you do not want to create your own 
					vocabulary lists, there are several companies 
					that produce flash card software that runs on 
					mobile phones, such as www.flashmybrain.
					com (there is a charge to set up an account). 
					You or your students can create vocabulary 
					flashcards that can be retrieved, shared, and 
					practiced anywhere.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Idea 8: Use the Text Messaging feature for circular writing</strong>
				</p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					The reality is that many students do not 
					like to write. They associate writing in the 
					school context with boring assignments and a 
					punitive environment of criticism and negative
					feedback. In other words, the fun is missing.
					However, if one considers writing as any 
					form of textual communication, it becomes 
					clear that students actually write a lot. The 
					number of text messages, status updates on 
					social networking sites, and instant messages 
					(IMs) sent by the average young learner is 
					staggering; clearly, a lot of writing is going 
					on! The challenge is to encourage that type of 
					writing that helps students learn English.
					If students are not ready to write essays, 
					they can practice with shorter texts to develop 
					their writing skills. One activity is <em>circular writing</em>,
					where students create a story together 
					by contributing one text message at a time. 
					Each student writes a sentence or two and 
					then sends this on to the next student, who 
					adds another message, and so on until the 
					story is complete. The teacher is copied and 
					has a record of the story as it emerges. You can 
					experiment with different text types such as 
					narratives (as in the example above), or shorter 
					forms such as news reports, instructions, and 
					warnings.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Idea 9: Use the Text Messaging feature for tandem learning</strong>
				</p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Interactive writing can be encouraged 
					through <em>tandem learning</em>. In this activity two 
					students who wish to learn each other’s native 
					language pair up and exchange text messages. 
					I recently used this technique with a group of 
					16-year-old high school students from Taiwan 
					preparing for a trip to the UK and a group of 
					London-based students taking Chinese language
					classes. Here is a good example of the 
					situated learning I referred to earlier:

				<p class="journal">
					Theo: [having lunch in a Chinese restaurant] What do you call those dump-lings again? <br />
					Jun: They called yum cha. Hen hao chi! [They taste great!]
				</p>

				<p><strong>Idea 10: Use the mobile phone to keep a blog</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					A more advanced form of using the mobile 
					phone for writing tasks is keeping a blog. This 
					does require a phone with a connection to the 
					Internet (or the use of a wireless network at 
					home or perhaps at school). Students use the 
					Text Messaging and Camera features to add 
					messages and post pictures to their personal 
					blogs. This is great for writing about personal 
					experiences, places visited, and people met, 
					but it can also be used as an activity in which 
					students collect information and report on it 
					like journalists. Teachers can read these blogs 
					and provide feedback, request more information,
					or ask students to comment on each 
					other’s work.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Idea 11: Use the mobile phone for microblogging on Twitter</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					No report on mobile writing would be 
					complete without mention of Twitter, the 
					popular microblogging  service. Microblogging
					involves sending short messages (with a 
					limit of 140  characters, including punctuation and spaces)
					from a computer or a mobile 
					phone. Initially intended to provide friends 
					with status updates (“Now going to the gym,” 
					“Watching Lost in Translation,” “Feeding 
					the hamster”), Twitter is now used by many 
					different professions, including educators, to 
					keep people informed about who is doing 
					what. You can use Twitter for a wide variety of 
					assignments, such as asking students to report 
					on their daily activities. To focus on specific 
					aspects of language, you could ask students 
					to write down each idiom they find in a book 
					they are reading or to report when they hear 
					someone use a negative adverb such as seldom
					or hardly. You may not be able to (or want to!) 
					read all the comments, or tweets, yourself, but 
					you could ask students to follow some of their 
					classmates’ tweets and respond to them.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Idea 12: Use the mobile phone for social networking</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Like Twitter, Facebook and MySpace are 
					enormously popular social networking tools
					that allow groups of “friends” to meet, post 
					messages, share pictures, and generally interact
					online in a myriad of ways. Most of the 
					interaction takes place in writing, and simply 
					asking students to use English instead of 
					their native language produces a great deal of 
					writing practice. Some teachers actively use 
					such sites to keep in touch with students or 
					to organize activities online. The sites can be 
					accessed through mobile phones, and it could 
					be good fun to ask students to post on each 
					other’s pages in relation to a topic you have 
					just discussed in class. This activity is best 
					used within range of a wireless network, so it 
					may not work for everyone.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Idea 13: Use the mobile phone for a language exchange</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Using phones for speaking may not seem 
					like an original idea, but one way to encourage
					reluctant students to start speaking is to 
					establish a language exchange. In this activity 
					two students who want to learn each other’s 
					native language talk in that target language for 
					half of the time. This activity may be expensive
					unless students can use Skype on their 
					mobile phones.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Idea 14: Use the mobile phone for “phlogging”</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					To encourage students to practice individual
					speaking, they could start phlogging, a 
					recent form of blogging that entails calling a 
					number and leaving a message on a website. 
					Some programs like the currently free www.
					ipadio.com will even automatically transcribe 
					the recording. This is an excellent task-based 
					learning tool for students to update oral and 
					written reports about a given project.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Idea 15: Use mobile phone memory to distribute listening material</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Many phones have memory for graphics, 
					photos, and music that you can use to download
					listening material for your students, who 
					can in turn transfer them to their phones or 
					other media. This could be a recording of your 
					class, a podcast, or course listening materials. 
					In addition to providing hundreds of existing 
					podcasts for English language learners, the 
					iTunes U website (www.apple.com/education/
					itunes-u) will upload your own podcasts to 
					which students can subscribe.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Audiobooks are another source of listening 
					materials. These can be downloaded in a variety
					of formats and can then be transferred and
				</p>

				<p>
					played back on any phone that has sufficient 
					audio capabilities. Numerous commercial 
					websites sell audiobooks read by professional 
					readers, but there are also websites where public
					domain audiobooks can be downloaded for 
					free, such as http://librivox.org.
				</p>

					<p><strong>Idea 16: Use mobile phone memory to distribute reading material</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Similar to the listening idea above, you 
					could download reading materials for your 
					students. There are numerous sites with free 
					reading material, including Project Gutenberg
					(www.gutenberg.org), which also has 
					many audiobooks available. Many books are 
					now published in mobile friendly formats. As 
					one exercise, you can ask students to use the 
					voice recorder to take notes about the book 
					while they are reading. The books, along with 
					students’ reflections, can then be discussed 
					during the next class.
				</p>	

					<p><strong>Idea 17: Use the mobile phone to play games</strong>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Many of the free games for mobile phones, 
					such as Scrabble and crossword puzzles, 
					involve a focus on language. Although not all 
					of them may be suitable for second language 
					learners, they at least encourage students to 
					engage with the target language, and to do 
					so in the context of entertainment. Once 
					students determine that their phones have the 
					capability to play games, they must download 
					and install the programs.
				</p>	

					<p>
						<strong>Idea 18: Use the Voice Memo Recorder, Notes, and
						Calendar features to keep a portfolio</strong>
					</p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Most learning inevitably takes place outside the
					classroom. Students need to process 
					new information and assimilate it into their 
					<em>interlanguage</em>, which is their current stage of 
					second language development as reflected by 
					their control of grammar, syntax, and vocabulary.
					Encouraging students to reflect about 
					their language acquisition helps them to take 
					control of their own learning and positively 
					affects the assimilation process.
				</p>	

				<p class="bodytext">
					Many students either do not enjoy or do 
					not have the discipline to keeping a formal 
					journal or portfolio to reflect on their learning,
					even an online one such as the European 
					e-portfolio (www.eelp.org/eportfolio). Mobile 
					phones, by virtue of their portability, lower 
					this barrier. Ask students to document their 
					learning progress by using the Notes and 
					Voice Memo Recorder features. In this way, 
					instant reflection replaces the formal e-portfolio.
					However, it is important to explain 
					what you expect in terms of the amount and 
					frequency of reflection (and explain why!), so 
					that students take the activity seriously. Ask 
					students to document their use of the language
					outside the classroom and any problems 
					they encounter, such as a communication 
					breakdown or misunderstanding, as well as 
					any successful communicative interactions. 
					Be creative! Some teachers use portfolio assessment
					to give credit for work done outside 
					the classroom, which is also possible with a 
					mobile phone portfolio.
				</p>	

				<p class="bodytext">
					In addition, you could encourage students 
					to use the Calendar feature or other productivity
					tool available on most phones to set 
					goals, deadlines for assignments, and reminders to
					rehearse material covered in class.
				</p>	

				<p><strong>Idea 19: Use the mobile phone to check student comprehension and get feedback</strong></p>
			
				<p class="bodytext">
					The previous ideas focus on learning, but 
					mobile phones can also help you in your 
					teaching. One way is to add an element of 
					interactivity to your classes through audience 
					participation. Polleverywhere (www.polleverywhere.com)
					is a free program that allows the 
					teacher to pose survey questions to students. 
					Students respond by texting their responses 
					and the results show up immediately in a PowerPoint
					presentation or on a website. This is 
					very useful for checking student comprehension and
					to get their opinions. You could, for 
					example, ask students to choose from one of 
					several options for the next classroom activity. 
					This tool is particularly useful in larger classes 
					where it is not easy to get feedback from all 
					students.
				</p>	

					<p><strong>Idea 20: Use mobile phone memory for research and data collection</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Mobile phones are now becoming indispensible
					for research and data collection. 
					Being small and light, they are excellent portable
					tools for researchers to collect socioeco-nomic, health, and other critical information 
					from communities worldwide. Searching for 
					the term “data collection” at http://mobileactive.org
					will show examples of this type of 
					research and data collection. As an advanced 
					project, students can replicate similar projects 
					on a smaller scale, or come up with original 
					mobile phone research tasks. The phlogging 
					tool mentioned in Idea 14 is another way

				<h2>
					Potential problems and solutions when 
					using mobile phones in the classroom
				</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Following are some potential problems 
					associated with using mobile phones in the 
					classroom, along with some possible solutions 
					and suggestions
				</p>
					

				<p><strong>Lack of access to mobile phones</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Not all students in all classes will have 
					mobile phones, and the concerns around lack 
					of access are valid; however, it is probably 
					safe to say that of all the technologies available
					to teachers, mobile phones are the most 
					widespread. I remember visiting Lake Tana 
					in northern Ethiopia in 2005. There was no 
					Internet, no computers, not even electricity 
					for much of the day. I took a boat trip across 
					a remote part of the lake and on my return 
					realized I had left my money in the hotel. 
					My guide pulled out his cell phone and said 
					“Why don’t you just text me the money?”, 
					referring to a widely used practice in many 
					parts of Africa that allow payment by sending 
					someone text credits. I was stunned as this was 
					unheard of in the “developed” country I lived 
					in at the time.
				</p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					It is also important to make sure all students
					have access to phones that have the 
					capabilities you need. In 2010 it is likely that 
					most phones have most of the features mentioned above,
					but do check. One solution is 
					to share phones between students for certain 
					activities.
				</p>
					

				<p><strong>Cost of mobile phones and wireless services</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					It is important to realize that not all students
					have access to mobile phone technology 
					and to not place a financial burden on your 
					students and their parents by requiring students
					to have phones. Activities such as tex-ting, going online, and of course making calls 
					cost money. Not every student has an unlimited
					calling plan. Some of the ideas above 
					involve sending and receiving text messages, 
					which could be a problem because not all 
					students subscribe to a texting plan. In some 
					countries this can be expensive (subscribers in 
					the United States, for example, pay even for 
					receiving messages).
				</p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Transferring text messages to a computer 
					is one way to avoid texting charges. Another 
					alternative is to create a free text number for 
					your school. The messages are then free for 
					students to send, and the costs are borne 
					by the school. Another free alternative is to 
					send text messages from a website that offers 
					free texting, such as www.textmefree.com; a 
					downside is that these types of websites typically
					display advertising. A fourth alternative 
					is to request funding from your institution or 
					a government entity; for example, my university
					makes text message bundles available on 
					request.
				</p>
					

				<p><strong>Noise and disruption in class</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Despite the exciting potential for mobile 
					phones to increase opportunities for learning, 
					the prospect of allowing noisy phones into 
					a classroom may seem a bit daunting, especially
					if one has little experience using them 
					as a teaching tool. As with music, movies, 
					and computers, their usefulness depends on 
					having clear tasks for your students to work 
					with. Phones can be disruptive. For example, 
					it would be counterproductive if they rang in 
					class in the middle of a silent reading activity. 
					Clearly some ground rules are needed. It is 
					also possible that your school either prohibits 
					cell phone use in class or does not yet have 
					a policy. In that case you will need to communicate
					your intentions to the head of your 
					department.
				</p>
					

				<p><strong>Privacy considerations</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					It is paramount to consider issues of privacy
					before using mobile phones in class. If 
					you teach younger learners, you may need to 
					get parents’ consent to use mobile phones in 
					school. Some students may be reluctant to 
					share private information with others, so it 
					is important to explain to them what your

				generates. For example, what happens if all 
				of your students start texting you? Just like 
				with emails in the 1990s, you will need to 
				set boundaries and make it clear to students 
				what they can send to you when, what you 
				can and cannot respond to, and what you 
				will respond to individually and in class. 
				Even receiving 50  text messages may not be 
				an issue if they all relate to the same assignment
				you set in class and you can follow up 
				with the whole group. There are also tools 
				that can help you manage text messages. 
				Programs like Notepage (www.notepage.net) 
				let teachers respond to multiple text messages 
				or send out bulk messages from a computer, 
				thus greatly reducing the time needed to 
				respond.

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				
				<p class="bodytext">
					All the ideas above allow you to offer 
					increased opportunities for language learning 
					by taking advantage of a tool that students 
					are intimately familiar with and carry around 
					at all times. Dealing with the challenges of 
					using mobile phones may seem daunting, but 
					teachers I know who use them have found it 
					to be a worthwhile investment of their time 
					and a welcome addition to their language 
					teaching methods.
