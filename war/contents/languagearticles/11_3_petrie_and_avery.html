					he mid- to late 1990s was an 
					exciting time for those concerned
					with incorporating 
					w technology into their teaching of 
					English as a second or foreign language 
					(ESL/EFL). Commonly referred to as 
					Computer-Assisted Language Learning
					(CALL), or sometimes with the 
					broader term Technology-Enhanced 
					Language Learning (TELL), the field 
					took huge leaps forward during these 
					years. Up until this point, the many 
					ways of researching and applying 
					CALL were hit or miss and included 
					little reflection about differences in 
					methodology. Correspondingly, the 
					literature on CALL was characterized
					by cross talk—miscommunication 
					among researchers and practitioners 
					without a clear understanding of the 
					source of different assumptions. A few 
					researchers and users of CALL took 
					note of the situation and began to 
					make sense of the cacophony, which 
					helped to push the field forward (Chapelle
					1995, 1997; Salaberry 1999). 
					This article focuses on one perhaps 
					lesser-known approach to using technologies
					in the classroom that was 
					created during this time and that is 
					especially useful for ESL/EFL teachers 
					to consider. We describe the model, 
					explain its significance, and then provide
					activity ideas that teacher educators can use when incorporating the 
					model into professional development 
					workshops or in-service trainings.

					learning process and learning strategies, appropriate
					feedback and time to carry out tasks, 
					and support for learner autonomy (Egbert 
					and Hanson-Smith 1999).
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Chapelle (1995, 1997) was an early voice 
					leading this charge, while Egbert and Hanson-Smith
					(1999) authored a text that gave teachers
					concrete ideas on how to apply SLA techniques
					in the classroom, such as using email 
					pen-pals to encourage students to interact 
					with others in the target language, and choosing
					software that allowed students to work at 
					their own individual pace and make choices 
					about the tools that they chose to use or 
					ignore, thus boosting autonomy. The work of 
					Egbert and Hanson-Smith (1999) continues 
					to give ESL/EFL teachers a solid foundation 
					on which to design their lessons. For those of 
					us who design training courses and carry out 
					teacher education in the area of CALL, it provides
					valuable ideas on how to link technology 
					use in the classroom with sound language 
					learning pedagogy.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					However, many of us who organize CALL 
					teacher training courses and workshops 
					notice that pre-service and in-service teachers 
					approach the use of technology with a variety 
					of strong assumptions. Importantly, if these 
					assumptions are not identified and addressed, 
					they impact the way that the teacher trainees 
					interpret the importance of SLA principles 
					when using language technologies. Therefore, 
					there is a critical need to make sense of these 
					initial assumptions when designing professional
					development courses for pre-service 
					and in-service teachers.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					One way to accomplish this is to adopt 
					Warschauer’s (1998) framework, which explains 
					the vastly different perspectives with which 
					researchers in language technology approach 
					their work, and provides a needed bridge 
					between varying sets of assumptions. Although 
					Warschauer (1998) was describing researchers’ 
					perspectives, the framework easily lends itself to 
					help novice teachers identify their own approaches
					to instructional technology and to thoughtfully
					explore and consider other approaches, 
					hopefully leading to a well-informed and productive
					use of technology in the classroom.
				</p>

			</section> <!-- Section 1 -->

			<section class="subsection" data-number="2" data-name="Warschauer's model">

				<h2>Warschauer’s model</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Warschauer (1998) suggests that researchers
					working in the field of language technology
					approach their work from very different 
					positions. These differences have a profound 
					influence on the assumptions that they make 
					and the conclusions they draw. Warschauer 
					identifies the three positions as (1) determinist,
					(2) instrumental, and (3) critical.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Determinist position</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					According to Warschauer (1998), a determinist
					position associates the mere presence 
					of computers with successful language learning.
					In other words, technology has a “magic” 
					effect on learning, and simply including it will 
					determine a more positive outcome for any 
					activity. Researchers who approach their work 
					from this position are quick to draw positive 
					conclusions about technology’s impact and are 
					likely to ignore the many complex and intervening
					factors surrounding technology use.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Instrumental position</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Those who hold the instrumental perspective
					believe that technology is just a tool 
					that is not capable of bringing about positive 
					learning results in and of itself. Rather, the 
					result depends on how well the technology 
					is incorporated into the lesson, how well it 
					supports the objectives, and how well the 
					computer-based activities are managed. Thus, 
					although technology can be instrumental in 
					bringing about effective language learning, it 
					all depends on the abilities of the teacher to 
					implement CALL in the classroom.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Critical position</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The critical position regarding technology 
					and language learning indicates that a learning
					environment is its own ecosystem and 
					that any addition to the ecosystem—such 
					as instructional technology—brings about a 
					slightly or radically different learning environment.
					These subtle or obvious changes 
					are often sociocultural; there may be shifts in 
					power, identity, or communication patterns, 
					or changes in relationships between individuals
					and groups. For example, a teacher may 
					notice that when students hold a class meeting 
					through an online discussion board (rather 
					than face-to-face), there are changes in power, 
					identity, and relationships. Quieter students 
					may lead or even dominate the online discussion,
					and students with stronger reading-writing proficiency have the advantage in a

				<h2>Application of Warschauer's model to professional development</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Application of Warschauer’s model to 
					professional development
					Warschauer (1998) dismisses the determinist
					approach, recognizes the value of 
					the instrumental approach, and encourages 
					researchers to adopt a critical view of technology.
					However, the utility of Warschauer’s 
					model is how it organizes the numerous disparate
					voices and brings clarity to the many different
					perspectives that ESL/EFL teacher educators
					encounter in their CALL workshops or 
					in-service sessions. A variation on this model 
					helps teacher educators to identify their own 
					and others’ positions and respond by making
					informed decisions regarding appropriate 
					activities for professional development. This 
					variation is based on one minor adaptation 
					that associates the determinist position with 
					two extreme assumptions potentially held by 
					teachers who are entering the field of ESL/
					EFL. In other words, ESL/EFL teachers may 
					be predisposed to believe that the mere presence
					of technology will bring about not only 
					positive results in their classrooms, but also 
					negative results. Therefore, a teacher who 
					takes up the determinist position may be (1) a 
					technophile (a lover of technology, certain 
					that it will fix any instructional problems), or 
					(2) a technophobe (a hater of technology, certain
					that it will destroy instruction). In addition,
					a teacher may hold the (3) instrumental 
					position (viewing technology as a neutral tool, 
					certain that its success or failure is entirely 
					dependent on the instructional choices that 
					are made), or a (4) critical position (viewing 
					technology as capable of impacting classrooms 
					in deep, subtle, and unpredictable ways, certain
					that sociocultural elements should be 
					considered when using and evaluating technology use).
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Why do these positions matter? Because, 
					ideally, ESL/EFL teachers are familiar with 
					and knowledgeable about relevant language 
					technologies, are willing to consider incorporating
					them into instruction, and are capable 
					of posing a full range of questions about the 
					impact of technology on language acquisition 
					and sociocultural factors. Therefore, we have 
					three objectives when conducting professional
					development activities for ESL/EFL 
					teachers in the area of CALL: 
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						To present positive experiences with 
						spotlighted technologies (both familiar and novel) to foster imagination 
						and innovation in using them to teach 
						language
					</li>

					<li>
						To provide rich experiences and knowledge of SLA principle-driven uses of 
						technologies to teach language
					</li>

					<li>
						To foster critical consideration of 
						both obvious and subtle sociocultural
						impacts of technology on learners, 
						teachers, and the community
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p class="bodytext">
					A teacher starting from one of the four 
					positions (technophile, technophobe, instrumental,
					and critical) has a very different 
					path to these three objectives than a teacher
					approaching from a different position. 
					Therefore, an essential first step is to have 
					teachers clearly identify their assumptions 
					about technology and teaching, which we do 
					by administering the eight-question survey 
					in Figure 1.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					After teachers complete the survey, we 
					explain the model and show how the survey 
					responses correspond with the four assumptions
					about CALL: technophobe (1 and 2); 
					technophile (3 and 4); instrumentalist (5 and 
					6); and critical (7 and 8). We then discuss 
					the teachers’ responses and prepare to deliver 
					the appropriate whole group and individual 
					activities for professional development.
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						Those who are technophiles benefit 
						from observing and discussing cases 
						where the use of technology does not 
						bring about English learning or has 
						a negative impact on learning or on 
						sociocultural interactions.
					</li>

					<li>
						Those who approach technology from a 
						technophobe position require activities 
						that revolve around growing comfortable
						with technology, learning to use it 
						in authentic contexts, and experiencing 
						the positive impact that technology can 
						have on English learning—impacts that 
						can outweigh the challenges.
					</li>

					<li>
						Those who view technology from an 
						instrumental position have the benefit
						of assuming that instructional factors
						matter; the central area of focus 
						for them is experiencing and learning

				<h2>Activity ideas for the technophile position</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					These activities are especially important 
					for those who identify themselves as technophiles,
					and include methods to encourage 
					teachers to let go of the assumption that technology
					will automatically lead to improved 
					language learning outcomes in the classroom. 
					The activities will also foster a deeper understanding
					of the crucial role that teachers have 
					in designing instruction that incorporates 
					technology.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Comparing lessons that incorporate technology</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Some teachers do not recognize that there 
					are endless choices that they can make in 
					using technology in class, and that these 
					instructional choices have a significant impact 
					on the success or failure of a language learning 
					lesson. This activity provides an opportunity 
					for teachers to become aware of both instructional
					choices and their outcomes.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					To begin, assign everyone in the professional
					development course the same English 
					language item (e.g., the past perfect, negation, 
					idiomatic expressions) and the same technology—one
					that they have been introduced to 
					and to which they have access (e.g., a concordancer
					for textual analysis—see Salsbury 
					and Crummer 2008). Then, ask the teachers
					to independently create a short lesson to 
					teach the language item using the technology. 
					Teachers should create a detailed lesson plan 
					to hand out to the other course participants. 
					Provide an opportunity for the participants to 
					experience (not just talk about) the lessons the

				<p>
					class members have created, exchange lesson 
					plans, and discuss the differences in choices—
					including an evaluative discussion of which 
					instructional factors made some technology 
					uses more effective. It is likely that the participants
					will discover a wide range of choices 
					of differing quality, including individual vs. 
					collaborative use of the technology, use of the 
					technology as a tutorial vs. a creative tool, and 
					teacher-led vs. student-led uses.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Technology challenge</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					This activity helps teachers boost their 
					awareness of the individual characteristics of 
					technologies and their suitability or unsuitability
					for use in teaching the many skills and 
					sub-skills across a language.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					First create a list of technologies that teachers
					have had experience with, using either a 
					survey or the results from a whole group discussion.
					Optimally, create a list that contains 
					the same number of technologies as there are 
					participants in the course. Ask each teacher to 
					choose a technology on the list for this activity—especially
					one that he or she personally 
					feels is likely to be helpful to language teachers. 
					Explain that there will be a series of challenges, 
					and that for each one, an unworthy technology 
					will be “voted off the island” (a popular concept
					currently in vogue in the United States 
					whereby the group votes on the merits of 
					something and decides to keep it or discard it).
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Next, create several challenges for the 
					activity: a mixture of teaching items (e.g., 
					vocabulary related to a holiday) and instructional
					issues (e.g., motivating students who 
					simply want to think about soccer). For each 
					challenge, announce what the teachers have to 
					teach or accomplish with the technology they 
					have chosen and give them 5 to 10 minutes 
					to create a plan. When the time ends, have 
					all participants share their plans and discuss 
					which technologies best lend themselves to 
					supporting the task and which technologies 
					fail to do so. Participants vote for the technology
					to be voted off the island for that challenge.
					However, this technology is brought 
					back for the next challenge round, underscoring
					the idea that although it may not lend 
					itself to one task, it may work well for another. 
					After the final challenge, end by discussing the 
					overall characteristics of the technologies that 
					were selected by the teacher trainees.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Principle-based reading</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					There are several books available that provide
					teachers with a close look at the impact 
					of instructional choices when incorporating 
					technology, including texts by Egbert (2005) 
					and Chapelle and Jamieson (2008). These 
					texts are appropriate for both independent 
					and group reading as well as for learning at a 
					distance through online postings.

				<h2>Activity ideas for the technophobe position</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The following activity ideas are especially 
					important for those who identify themselves 
					as technophobes, and will increase the teachers’
					comfort level with using technology to 
					impart effective language lessons. 
				</p>

				<p><strong>Technology petting zoo</strong></p>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					This activity requires different technologies
					to be accessible in a computer lab or other 
					room and arranged in separate stations. The 
					authors prefer to include a combination of 
					several types of technologies that we find useful
					for language instruction, including: 
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Resources.</strong> Provide a place for teachers 
						and students to access content such as 
						dictionaries and synonym finders. For 
						example, at a computer station with 
						audio, you may download a resource 
						website such as Teachers’ TV (www.
						teachers.tv), a large collection of videos 
						about a wide range of academic areas 
						across the curriculum.
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Creation tools.</strong> Provide a way for
						students to produce documents, presentations,
						or other products with 
						appropriate programs. For example, at 
						a computer station with audio capability,
						download Prezi (http://prezi.com), 
						a creation tool website that allows 
						teachers and students to co-create presentations
						in a non-linear manner using 
						multimedia.
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Widgets.</strong> Create a station where students
						can work with special applications,
						such as a computer containing 
						the Oneword widget (http://oneword.
						com), an application that provides 
						users with a one-word writing prompt 
						in English and 60 seconds of writing 
						time.

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Hardware.</strong> These consist of tools you 
						can pick up and handle that can be

						recorders and digital cameras.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="bodytext">
					An important consideration, and one that 
					benefits teacher trainees and their prospective
					students, is to investigate mainstream 
					technologies and to not limit yourself to 
					technologies developed specifically for language
					learning. In addition, it is essential to 
					create clear directions for each technology 
					station so that teachers know how to operate 
					the technology and can thoughtfully consider 
					how they would use it in their classrooms. 
					If possible, have an assistant nearby who is 
					familiar with the technologies and can provide 
					additional help. Encourage teachers to visit 
					each station and work alone or with a partner. 
					If they work in pairs, each partner should take 
					turns handling and operating the technology. 
					Provide as much time to explore as teachers 
					like and an opportunity afterwards for them 
					to reflect on any strategies they came up with 
					or on the increased comfort level that they 
					experienced. (See Appendix 1 for examples 
					of sample activities using resources, creation 
					tools, and widgets.)
				</p>

				<p><strong>Exploring emerging technologies</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Each issue of <em>Language Learning and Technology</em>
					(available online at http://llt.msu.edu/) 
					has a column titled “Emerging Technologies.” 
					Ask teachers to browse current and past columns
					describing the technologies that have 
					made their way into language instruction. 
					After they read the articles, teachers as a 
					group discuss and reach a consensus about 
					the technologies they would like to explore. 
					Alternatively, individual teachers can choose 
					the technology that most interests them (and 
					to which they have access) and present the 
					technology to the group, emphasizing the 
					technology’s potential to enhance language 
					learning opportunities. For example, a teacher 
					may choose Godwin-Jones’ (2003) online 
					coverage of blogging, read some sample blogs 
					written by others, and then report to the 
					whole class on how blogging might influence 
					their students’ writing and reading experiences.
					The class can then consider starting 
					blogs of their own through a free service such 
					as Blogger (www.blogger.com) or Edublogs 
					(http://theedublogger.com).
				</p>

				<p><strong>Personal language learning podcasts</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					To begin, ask teachers to identify their 
					personal interests—topics that they simply 
					enjoy learning and communicating about. 
					Then, ask each of them to search for audio 
					podcasts on the topic in English (this can be 
					done through a Google podcast search). A 
					current favorite of the authors is <em>The World in Words</em>
					audio podcast series (www.theworld.
					org/rss/twiw.xml), which provides interesting 
					news stories that relate to language, language 
					learning, and sociolinguistics. Ask teachers 
					to listen to 5 to 10 podcasts over a week or 
					more while keeping a journal in which they 
					record their language development in grammar,
					vocabulary, or knowledge of language 
					functions. Provide an opportunity for teachers
					to discuss their experiences and fill out a 
					self-evaluation survey to document the impact 
					that the technology has had on their English 
					language development. If teachers discover 
					podcast series that have assisted them with 
					language learning, suggest that they subscribe 
					to continue the learning (which will “push” 
					each newly released podcast into their technological repertoire).

				<h2>Activity ideas for teachers to foster the critical position</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The following activities encourage teachers
					to consider the sociocultural contexts and 
					impacts of technology on language learning. 
					These are extremely significant for those 
					who identify with the instrumental position, 
					but will prove useful for all teachers as they 
					develop a critical perspective about CALL in 
					the classroom.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Engaging reading</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					For many teachers, the consideration of 
					sociocultural contexts is a challenging task. 
					Two very engaging texts assist teachers to see 
					classrooms as ecosystems that are impacted in 
					significant ways by the introduction of technologies.
					Both Postman (1993) and McLu-han (1994) are extremely enlightening on 
					this point. For example, McLuhan (1994) 
					includes many anecdotes about unexpected 
					sociocultural outcomes that ensue from the 
					introduction of technology, including the 
					very persuasive apocryphal story of a village in 
					India. A visiting group of engineers installed 
					plumbing in the village so that each home

				<p>
					was provided with running water and individuals
					no longer needed to depend on the 
					village well. When those who had installed 
					the plumbing returned to the village a short 
					time later, the villagers surprisingly asked that 
					the technology be removed because, without 
					the constant communication and relationship 
					building that traditionally occurred at the 
					communal well, “the whole social life of the 
					village had been impoverished” (McLuhan 
					1994, 86). Texts such as these provide teachers 
					with reflection and discussion material about 
					the ways that identity, relationships, and communication
					are impacted in unforeseen ways 
					by technology.

				<p><strong>Fishbowl comparative observation</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					In a fishbowl activity, each participant 
					gets an opportunity to speak without interruption,
					and there is also a chance for whole 
					class interaction at the end. This activity lets

				<p class="bodytext">
					To begin, create two technology-based 
					mini-lessons related to the learning of new 
					vocabulary (see Appendix 2 for examples 
					of two technology-based mini-lessons). Ask 
					four participants to volunteer to carry out 
					both mini-lessons while the rest of the class 
					observes. Before beginning the activity, pro-vide the observers with questions to guide 
					their noticing of interaction patterns (e.g., 
					Who is doing the communicating? How 
					evenly distributed is the communication? 
					What do student-teacher and student-student 
					interactions look like? What role are the stu-dents taking in determining the content of 
					the communication?). After the mini-lessons 
					are completed, provide time for each observer 
					to use his or her answers to the questions 
					to discuss the ways mini-lesson interactions 
					were impacted by the use of technology. This 
					activity can culminate with a whole class 
					discussion.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Case studies</strong></p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					This activity sets the stage for rich discussions
					about the subtle and unexpected 
					shifts that occur when teachers incorporate 
					technology into their classes. Case studies are 
					especially powerful for increasing the awareness
					of power, literacy, relationships, and 
					the spaces we create in classrooms. Journals 
					such as <em>TESOL Quarterly, Computer Assisted 
					Language Learning</em>, and <em>Language Learning 
					and Technology</em> occasionally include cases of 
					technology incorporation that raise sociocultural
					questions. Good examples include Lam 
					and Lawrence’s (2002) case of a high school 
					Spanish class and Lam’s (2000) case of a high 
					school student who develops language and 
					literacy as his identity changes through online 
					communication. Provide guiding questions 
					for the teachers (e.g., What roles do learners 
					take when they go online? Do learners shrink 
					or expand their linguistic horizons when they 
					go online?). If an online conferencing option 
					such as Skype is available, invite an author to 
					discuss a case with the group from a distance. 
					The authors of this article have pleasantly discovered
					that researchers are often quite willing 
					to talk about their findings in this way.

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Our understanding of the range of assump-tions that teachers bring with them regarding 
					the integration of technology with language 
					learning is based upon our growing experi-ence of providing professional development 
					for ESL/EFL teacher trainees from a variety 
					of countries. Applying a slightly modified 
					version of Warschauer’s (1998) model of 
					researchers’ approaches to language technol-ogy has given us the guiding principles for 
					responding to these assumptions with activi-ties that invite teachers to analyze, reflect on, 
					and refine their initial perspectives. Ultimate-ly, our goals for all teachers are the same—to 
					develop comfort with language learning tech-nologies, to approach them with innovation, 
					to design instruction according to sound SLA 
					principles, and to critically consider the socio-cultural impacts of technology integration. 
					This model for professional development can 
					help ESL/EFL instructors utilize technology 
					in the language learning classroom in the most 
					productive and rational way possible.

					<li>
						<strong>Instructions for Resource Area: <em>Teachers' TV</em></strong>

						<ul>
							<li>Go to http://teachers.tv and click on the "Subjects" link.</li>

							<li>
								Browse through the subjects, focusing on those that correspond to the ones you teach or
								that your students are learning in other classrooms.
							</li>

							<li>
								Pay special attention to videos titled "Lesson Starters."
							</li>

							<li>
								Choose one of the "Lesson Starters" that relates in some way to your ESL/EFL lesson
								or the curriculum students are learning in English in another classroom. How could 
								you incorporate this into your unit? How would you introduce the video? What 
								would you ask students to listen or watch for while they experience the video? What 
								would you ask students to do after the video? How would you tie the video into the 
								unit’s activities?
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Instructions for Creation Area: <em>Prezi</em></strong>

						<ul>
							<li>Go to http://prezi.com and sign up for a free "Public" account.</li>

							<li>
								Click on the "Learn" tab at the top of the page and watch Lesson One and Lesson
								Two to become familiar with what Prezi can do and how to use it. Note the way that 
								videos and images can be incorporated into presentations and how presentations can 
								be designed collaboratively. 
							</li>

							<li>
								Check out how Sabio (2010) uses Prezi to create lessons at his site, Ralph's EFL Junction
								(www.ralphsesljunction.com/prezi.html). In particular, observe the way that he 
								incorporates images in his “Quantifiers” presentation.
							</li>

							<li>
								Read the list of ideas for Prezi presentations in Pires's (2010) blog entry
								(http://e-blahblah.com/index.php/2010/01/). Consider how you might incorporate Prezi 
								into a presentation assignment for your students. How might it ease and support 
								the drafting process and the final presentation for them? How could you use it as a 
								presentation tool yourself?
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Instructions for Widget Area: <em>Oneword</em></strong>

						<ul>
							<li>
								Go to http://oneword.com and register at the site.
							</li>

							<li>
								Read the brief directions and click on "Go." Immediately begint o write about the
								word that appears at the top of the page—you have 60 seconds. The bar moving 
								across the bottom of the screen will visually remind you of how much time you have 
								remaining.
							</li>

							<li>
								Once you submit your entry, you will be able to see what others have written if you
								wish. Your entries are stored on the site so that you will be able to see any changes or 
								progression over time in your writing fluency.
							</li>

							<li>
								Consider whether this tool might be useful as a daily activity for your students to
								develop writing fluency. Do your students have consistent access to the Internet 
								either through computers or cellular phones? How might you shape the activity so 
								that students reach the objectives for their fluency building?

				<ol>
					<li>
						Technology Mini-Lesson Plan: Vocabulary Development with Google Images

						<ul>
							<li>
								Lesson preparation: Create a display of everyday items in a school from images you
								find through a Google Images search (click on “Images” at www.google.com and type 
								item names in the search box). Choose the most appropriate pictures, including those 
								with challenging, less familiar vocabulary, and copy and paste them into a document. 
								Create a wordless handout with these images only.
							</li>

							<li>
								Basic steps: Announce to the students that the vocabulary list this week relates to
								items found in a classroom or school. Divide the students into pairs, distribute the 
								handout, and ask each pair to label those images whose names they know or can guess 
								at. Next, ask the whole group to choose the most difficult vocabulary and to explain 
								why they want to learn it. Circle and label 10 of the most popular items to create the 
								week’s vocabulary list.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						Technology Mini-Lesson Plan: Vocabulary Development with Digital Camera Images

						<ul>
							<li>
								Lesson preparation: Secure two digital cameras and USB cords to download images
								from the cameras to a computer connected to a projector. Explain how to use the 
								equipment. Assign partners and distribute a camera to each student pair.
							</li>

							<li>
								Basic steps: Announce to the students that the vocabulary list this week relates to
								items found in a classroom or school. Students will create the vocabulary list this 
								week by concentrating on items that are of the most interest to them. The students 
								form pairs and use the digital camera to move around the classroom or school and 
								take pictures of items that they do not know the names of and would like to learn. 
								Give them 5 to 10 minutes to take pictures of items that they predict their own students
								might choose. After they have finished, have them download the pictures to the 
								computer and project them onto a screen. Then ask the group to discuss each picture 
								as it is projected and, if necessary, provide the correct name for each item. Let the 
								group choose the 10 items that they are most interested in learning that week. Copy 
								these images and labels to a document and distribute them to the class as the week’s 
								vocabulary list.
