				<h2>Technology in a content-based syllabus for ESP</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					A content-based curriculum integrates target language learning and content learning.
					Therefore, it is based on the content of a subject and on the use of authentic materials, and
					takes into consideration the students’ linguistic needs and learning styles. Brinton, Snow,
					and Wesche (1989:2) point out that content-based instruction “employs authentic
					reading materials which require students not
					only to understand information but to interpret and evaluate it as well.... [and] requires
					students to synthesize facts and ideas from
					multiple sources as preparation for writing.”
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					There are at least two major benefits of
					content-based instruction. First, if students are
					given multiple opportunities to interact with
					authentic, meaningful, and challenging material, the result is better learning (Brinton,
					Snow, and Wesche 1989; Kasper 2000a). Second, students’ motivation is enhanced with
					the use of authentic materials relevant to their
					goals (Chávez 1998). 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Since the main objective of an ESP course
					is to help students acquire the linguistic and
					communicative skills related to their disciplines, a content-based approach is especially
					useful. Content-based pedagogy promotes
					synthesising and evaluating, and helps students improve their academic skills by raising
					their awareness of the concepts of audience
					and purpose (Kasper 2000b). 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The Internet is a learning tool that fits well in
					a content-based ESP syllabus. Among the benefits of Internet use in the second and foreign
					language classroom, the most important are:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Increased motivation and participation
						by students (Warschauer 1996).
					</li> 
					
					<li>
						More opportunities to interact with the
						target language and content area because
						students spend more time on task
						(Kasper 2000b). 
					</li> 
					
					<li>
						Greater integration of reading and writing skills and opportunities to practice
						them in meaningful contexts.
					</li> 
					
					<li>
						The possibility to implement a pedagogy
						based on problem solving and critical
						thinking (Warschauer 1999). 
					</li> 
					
					<li>
						More self-paced autonomous learning
						that is learner-controlled rather than
						teacher-controlled (Mak 1995).
					</li> 
				</ul>

				<p class="bodytext">
					In addition to the benefits just cited, the
					Internet provides the resources necessary to
					carry out authentic projects and analysis, and
					thus develop the communicative competence
					of ESP students. Such resources allow teachers
					to design simulation activities and role-playing
					using authentic material. Kimball (1997)
					points out that “Internet-generated materials
					can be flexibly arrayed to engage students with
					topics and cognitive tasks relevant to students’
					professional futures.”

				<h2>WebQuests and other Internet-based activities</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Activities that can exploit Internet
					resources for ESP take many forms. In a discussion of using the Web for education,
					March (1997) explores the following five formats: topic hotlists, multimedia scrapbooks,
					treasure hunts, subject samplers, and
					WebQuests. The first two are activities for
					learners new to the WWW and are limited to
					simply exploring and downloading Internet
					resources. These resources can be organised
					and used later in other Web-based activities. A
					topic hotlist is a Web page containing sites categorised by topic. A multimedia scrapbook is
					a collection of Internet sites organised into categories, such as photos, maps, and sound and
					video clips. A treasure hunt develops students’
					knowledge of a topic by providing links to
					Web sites with information on that topic and
					by posing key questions concerning the sites.
					A subject sampler is an activity designed to get
					students to develop an affective connection to
					a topic by responding to Web sites with a personal perspective.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					WebQuests develop problem-solving skills
					and promote learning through analysis of complex concepts; thus, they are the most useful
					for ESP teaching. The sections that follow provide a description of WebQuests and their uses
					and benefits.
				</p>

					<h3>What is a WebQuest?</h3>

				<p class="bodytext">
					WebQuests are inquiry-based activities in
					which learners interact with information coming primarily from resources on the Internet
					(Dodge 1995). There are hundreds of Web
					sites that offer guidelines for teachers and samples of students’ work; entering “WebQuest” in
					any search engine will turn up dozens of them.
					One place to start is A WebQuest of WebQuests,
					an Internet site by Bernie Dodge (2001), a pro-

					-fessor of educational technology at San Diego
					State University in California who has been
					developing this model for Internet-based
					teaching and learning since 1995.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Most WebQuests are designed so that students can integrate complex concepts of
					a spe-cific discipline–for example, science, music,
					art, or history–with new technologies (Dodge
					1995; Abraham 1998; Cotton 1998). The
					principles underlying WebQuests are those of
					constructivism. Internet technology is integrated into the course curriculum, thus enabling
					students to learn by constructing their perceptions of complex concepts (Watson 1999).
				</p>					

				<p class="bodytext">
					A WebQuest must have the following steps
					(Dodge 1995):
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>An introduction that explains the activity and provides background information.</li>

					<li>A task that is feasible and interesting.</li>

					<li>A set of information sources needed to complete the task.</li>

					<li>A description of the process the learners should follow to complete the task.</li>

					<li>Some guidelines on how to organise the information.</li>

					<li>A conclusion that closes the quest.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					Dodge (1999) also distinguishes between
					short-term WebQuests (in which the main
					goal is that students make sense of new information) and long-term WebQuests (which
					involve students in deeper analysis and content transformation). 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					In a WebQuest, students go beyond mere
					fact finding by studying a controversial issue
					in order to analyze its components and suggest
					a solution (Krauss 2000). First, they need to
					learn some basic background information
					about the issue. Then, working in small
					groups, students become “experts” on some
					aspect of the problem by analyzing the Web
					sites given to them by the teacher. Finally, students complete a real world activity such as 
					e-mailing elected officials or presenting their
					interpretation to recognized experts on the
					topic (Krauss 2000).
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Research on WebQuests has focused on
					their use for interdisciplinary teaching (Pohan
					and Mathison 1998) and cooperative learning
					(Brucklacher and Gimbert 1999). WebQuests
					also promote learner motivation and skills in
					problem solving and decision making (Cotton
					1998; Seamon 1999). Most WebQuests are
					intended for middle or high school, but their
					use at university level has also been explored
					(Abraham 1998). 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					WebQuests foster cooperative learning,
					since students usually have to collaborate and
					share information to solve a problem or find
					an answer to a complex question. They engage
					students in performing authentic simulation
					tasks by providing up-to-date information on
					a topic and by helping students develop critical reading and synthesizing skills. They also
					promote writing with a purpose for a
					real-world audience.
				</p>

			<section class="subsection" data-number="3" data-name="WebQuests for content-based instructions">

				<h2>WebQuests for content-based instruction</h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					WebQuests are activities specially suited to
					content-based language learning; students perform a real world task using authentic materials
					related to a topic within their academic discipline. The pedagogical principles of a
					Web-Quest are to assign small groups of students
					with a challenging inquiry, provide access to
					an abundance of online resources, and scaffold
					the learning process to promote higher order
					thinking (March 1997).
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The rationale behind WebQuests has three
					components (March 1998): 
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						WebQuests promote motivation and
						authenticity. Students perform an
						authentic task, since they have to understand or solve a real world issue. Motivation is
						increased by giving students real
						resources and assigning them a role within a cooperative group, which implies
						that success depends on all members
						doing their jobs.
					</li>

					<li>
						WebQuests develop thinking skills. The
						question that the students have to
						research and answer should be a complex one that forces them to transform
						information. Dodge (1995) states that a
						WebQuest activity might require the following thinking skills: comparing, classifying,
						generalizing principles from
						observations or analysis, deducing,
						analysing errors in one’s own or others’
						thinking, constructing support for an
						assertion, abstracting, and analysing different perspectives about issues.
					</li>

					<li>
						WebQuests foster cooperative learning.
						Since WebQuests are concerned with
						complex topics, students have to coop-

					<li>-erate and take on specific roles to complete the task.</li>
				</ol>

				<p class="bodytext">
					WebQuests also meet the following four
					criteria for content-based activities:
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						Learning activities should provide more
						than one perspective on the content area.
						This is met by WebQuests, which offer a
						large number of Web pages with information on different aspects of a topic.
					</li>

					<li>
						Activities should present authentic content
						without oversimplifying it (Spiro and Jehng
						1990).
					</li>

					<li>
						Activities should incorporate visuals and
						other aids for making associations, since that
						facilitates deeper thinking (Craik and Lockhart 1972). The Web pages used in Web-Quests
						contain not only text, but also pictures, sound, and even animation.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						Activities should encourage the SQ3R formula: surveying, questioning, reading, recalling,
						and reviewing materials under study (Schmeck 1986).
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The Internet has been successfully used in
					ESP and content-based instruction. An example is the ESP course proposed by Kimball
					(1998), in which the focus is on “discipline-relevant concepts” and “tasks in the form
					of contextualized problem-sets.” The tasks are a vehicle for presenting samples of the target
					language. Teachers design the tasks to pose
					problems of relevance to the students, who
					then have to solve them, not simply by collecting information, but by engaging in sub-tasks
					of increasing complexity.
				</p>

				<h2>WebQuests in ESP for engineering</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Dodge (1999) provides a WebQuest
					“taskonomy” in which he describes formats for
					WebQuest tasks. Some of these tasks are particularly relevant to ESP because they help
					students develop skills associated with their
					discipline. Therefore, when designing tasks
					teachers must consider the students’ field of
					study and the methodology of that academic
					discipline. The technical English course I teach
					is for engineering students. I will describe some
					tasks that are relevant for teaching ESP to
					these students.
				</p>

				<h3>Summary and synthesis tasks</h3>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Summarising and paraphrasing are basic
					writing skills for engineers. Braine (1989)
					found that most assignments in writing courses for engineering require the summary and
					synthesis of information from multiple
					sources. Retelling tasks, which require students
					to read texts and reword them in order to produce a new document, are useful for
					develop-ing comprehension and summarising skills.
					Compilation tasks provide students with practice in explaining the choices they make and in
					paraphrasing information drawn from a variety of sources (Dodge 1999).
				</p>

				<h3>Design tasks</h3>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Design tasks fit well with the methodology
					and goals of engineering and are closely related to the work engineering students
					will perform after graduation. This type of task
					requires learners to create a product that
					achieves a predetermined goal and works within specified, authentic constraints, such as
					working within a budget and taking into
					account social, legal, and ethical restrictions
					(Dodge 1999). The motivation of the students
					will be high, since they do not feel that they
					are just performing a class activity. Design
					tasks can be used to practice discourse features
					of specific genres, such as proposals. The final
					result can also be an oral report presenting the
					product designed.
				</p>

				<h3>Negotiation and interaction tasks</h3>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Engineers have to use language not only to
					report information, but also to establish inter-personal relations. Consensus building tasks
					teach students to consider, articulate, and
					accommodate different viewpoints. Judgement tasks lead students to make decisions
					among a number of choices and use language
					articulately to justify their decisions. Students
					can be asked to evaluate authentic documents,
					such as technical specifications or advertisements. These tasks can help engineering
					students develop the reading and thinking skills
					necessary to write recommendations and evaluations and to learn the language of
					negotiation and interaction.
				</p>

				<h3>Analytical tasks</h3>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Analytical tasks require learners to look
					closely at one or more things, find similarities
					and differences, and determine the implications inherent in the similarities and differences
					(Dodge 1999). Such tasks are also useful
					for examining cause-and-effect relationships and providing students practice in the

				<p>
					rhetorical patterns typical of technical and sci-entific texts.
				</p>

				<h3>Scientific tasks</h3>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					Scientific tasks help students develop their
					skills in gathering data and making and testing
					hypotheses. As the final stage of a scientific
					task, students can write a report describing the
					results and implications of their research.
				</p>

				<h2>Effective use of WebQuests in ESP</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					Although the Internet is a useful tool in
					teaching, it has limitations and can pose problems for some learners. Elementary and
					intermediate level students can feel overwhelmed
					by the wealth of information and may lack the
					proficiency in English necessary to understand
					many texts. Of course, not all the information
					accessible on the Web is relevant for ESP students. Additionally, lack of direction may
					become an insuperable hindrance. Therefore, at
					every stage of an activity learners need to know
					the purpose of the task they are performing and
					what to do next.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					These difficulties can be overcome with
					appropriately planned WebQuests. A Web-Quest must be integrated into the ESP curriculum,
					taking into account the overall design and
					goals of the course. The teacher should explain
					the activity, its purpose, the benefits the students can obtain by doing it, and the expected
					outcomes. Before starting a WebQuest, students should be given some background information
					on the topic of the task and some practice with the vocabulary they will encounter in
					the WebQuest.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The task must be challenging and relevant
					to the students in order to maintain their interest and enhance their motivation. The type of
					WebQuest and the tasks that the students have
					to perform must be suitable to their level of
					knowledge of English and the ESP content
					area. The topic should be familiar to them and
					the material should be related to their field of
					knowledge, in order to enhance their confidence. The number, length, and linguistic difficulty
					of the texts will depend on the level of
					the students for whom the activity is intended.
					When using authentic materials in ESP, especially considering the abundance of material
					available online, it is preferable to simplify
					tasks rather than simplify authentic texts.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The tasks that the students have to complete should be divided into sub-tasks of
					increasing complexity and should be clearly
					described, thus guiding students through the
					activity. As the students work in groups, it is
					desirable to match less proficient with more
					proficient students. In this way, the more proficient students can take on the most complex
					roles and collaborate with the others to complete the task. A potential problem pointed out
					by Brown (1999) is the students’ lack of Internet knowledge. This can be solved by matching
					computer novices with more experienced students. However, this does not seem to be a serious
					problem in engineering classes, where most
					students are computer literate.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The guidelines for teachers given by
					Warschauer and Wittaker (1997) are useful for
					the design of WebQuests and for ways to use
					them in class. Teachers should consider carefully the goals of the task, not underestimate
					its complexity, provide necessary support, and
					involve students in decision making.
				</p>

			</section> <!-- Section 5 -->

			<section class="subsection" data-number="6" data-name="Conclusion">

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					
				<p class="bodytext">
					In this paper I have proposed that the Web-Quest can be used in a content-based syllabus
					for ESP. This activity involves the use of authentic material from different Internet sources and
					engages students in reading extensively on a
					topic related to their discipline, performing
					tasks of increasing complexity, and creating oral
					or written texts to present the results of their
					online work.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					WebQuests fit well in a learner-centred
					curriculum that seeks to help students develop
					autonomous learning. The use of technology
					with a content-based curriculum results in a
					learning environment in which students take
					more control of their learning. The role of the
					teacher is not to transmit knowledge, but to
					provide resources, help students develop learning strategies, guide the learning process, and
					offer support throughout the process.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The use of WebQuests to learn languages
					integrates the pedagogical benefits of project
					work, content-based instruction, and language
					learning via the Internet. ESP students become
					more motivated because they are using new
					technologies and authentic texts to complete
					authentic tasks related to their disciplines.
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The WebQuest is an activity that can be
					fruitfully exploited in ESP. It helps students
					develop academic skills such as scanning, skimming, paraphrasing, summarising, organising,

					analysing, and problem solving. Through ex-tensive reading students acquire the vocabu-lary
					related to a topic of their discipline. By
					using authentic texts to perform real world tasks
					students become aware of concepts such as pur-pose and audience and see the utility
					of study-ing a second or foreign language.
