				<h1>The E-pet: Enhancing Motivation in E-portfolios</h1>

				<p class="firstletter _09one">P</p>

				<p class="firstpagebody1 _09one">
					ortfolios are popular in lan-guage teaching, both as a 
					learning tool and a process-oriented assessment instrument. They 
					require the compilation of student 
					projects, performances, and other 
					assignments over a semester or school 
					year to record the growth of learning. 
					When portfolios are used for evalu-ation, they are called an alternative 
					assessment because the teacher assess-es progress through the collection of 
					student work, as opposed to basing 
					student achievement only on scores 
					from paper and pencil tests.
				</p>

				<p class="firstpagebody2 _09one">
					Any teaching method, including 
					portfolio-based instruction, will not 
					be fully successful if students are not 
					engaged in the process. This was the 
					situation at Thailand’s King Mongkut’s 
					University of Technology Thonburi, 
					where many undergraduate students 
					of science and engineering saw their 
					English classes as barely relevant and a 
					burden. Most students were more con-cerned with passing the course than 
					with learning and therefore did only 
					the minimum work required to get a 
					reasonable grade instead of devoting 
					themselves to improving their English. 
					This was in spite of the fact that their 
					English for Academic Purposes (EAP) 
					courses utilized paper-based portfolios, 
					allowed students to choose learning 
					tasks and materials from the self-access 
					center and the Internet, and encour-aged them to reflect on their learn-ing. Unfortunately,
					this reflection on 
					learning was often scanty, and portfo-lios were submitted with uncompleted 
					tasks and entries copied from other 
					students. Clearly, the students were 
					unmotivated, and the use of portfolios 
					had little beneficial effect.
				</p>

				<p class="firstpagebody2 _09one">
					In an attempt to improve the 
					situation, we introduced an electronic 
					portfolio (e-portfolio) project. While 
					traditional portfolios are paper-based, 
					the relatively recent inclusion of com-puters in education has led to the 
					development of e-portfolios, where 
					the coursework is typically assigned, 
					accessed, completed, evaluated, and 
					stored on a computer or website. In 
					this article we will describe and evalu-ate this e-portfolio project and will 
					look specifically at the e-pet, a special 
					feature that keeps students motivated.

			<h2>Varieties of motivation</h2>

			<p class="bodytext">
				E-portfolios have several advantages: they 
				are easy to search, enable the use of multimedia projects, and allow efficient feedback on 
				student work. The benefits of e-portfolios, 
				both for learning and evaluation, suggest that 
				they will have an increasingly important role 
				in education (Love, McKean, and Gathercoal 
				2004).
			</p>
				
			<p class="bodytext">
				Nevertheless, a key prerequisite for effective learning from e-portfolios is that students 
				are motivated (Al Kahtani 1999; Tosh et al. 
				2005). If students are not sufficiently motivated, e-portfolio work becomes a chore, and 
				students only do the minimum work to get 
				required grades, which reduces the e-portfolio’s learning benefits.–
				Motivation is a complex topic with a 
				plethora of competing theories, interpretations, and strategies. In the instructional
				context, teachers should be aware of two types of 
				motivation. <em>Extrinsic motivation</em> comes from 
				a source external to the student, such as the 
				expectation of a reward, which might be a 
				grade, a prize, or positive feedback. <em>Intrinsic motivation</em>,
				on the other hand, comes from 
				sources internal to the student, such as a sense 
				of accomplishment or the satisfaction of successful collaboration with others.
			</p>

			<p class="bodytext">				
				Besides understanding motivation, teachers also need to recognize that, due to individual
				learning styles, different students will 
				respond to different motivational strategies in 
				the classroom. E-portfolios are very useful to 
				teachers because they offer a variety of ways to 
				motivate all types of students.

		<section class="section" data-number="2" data-name="Motivating components of the e-portfolio">

			<h2>Motivating components of the e-portfolio</h2>

			<p class="bodytext">
				In attempting to make the e-portfolio 
				motivating, we focused on two key issues: 
				(1) getting “students to participate in learning 
				tasks that they do not initially find interesting” (Harlen 2006, 64), and (2) retaining 
				student interest so they will not abandon 
				those learning tasks (Dörnyei 2001). This 
				calls for strategies to create initial interest and 
				make the abandonment of e-portfolios more 
				difficult.
			</p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				Establishing initial interest begins with a 
				focus on how students perceive e-portfolio 
				as a way to document their learning, which 
				can encourage them to identify with the 
				e-portfolios (Tosh et al. 2005). To interest and 
				involve students in the process, the e-portfolio 
				we designed included the following:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					An	 attractive,	 user-friendly	 webpage	
					design that is aesthetically pleasing to 
					students.
				</li>

				<li>
					A	learner	contract	between	the	student	
					and teacher that outlines a practical and 
					concrete study plan for the completion 
					of certain goals and activities within 
					a set time. Involving students in decisions about assignments makes their 
					learning more relevant.
				</li>

				<li>
					A	 personal	 profile	 page	 resembling	
					social networking sites such as MySpace 
					and Facebook that students customize 
					with pictures and other information. 
					Applying this feature to e-portfolios 
					supports a sense of community and 
					provides a system to enhance students’ 
					status. Examples of the rewards students receive for this status are the 
					“interestingness” score for photos on 
					Flickr and the comments from other 
					users (Biever 2006).
				</li>

				<li>
					A	mechanism	to	give	students	external	
					rewards (in addition to grades) for 
					learning new vocabulary items, grammar points, and learning strategies, 
					such as the deposit of gold coins in 
					treasure boxes. Although the gold coins 
					have no real value, their symbolic value 
					motivates students to pay more attention to vocabulary, grammar, and strategies
					while completing activities.
				</li>

				<li>
					A	link	that	lists	the	best	student	portfolios. This will motivate the model
					students by publicly acknowledging their 
					achievements, and their classmates will 
					view the model portfolios and learn 
					from that work.
				</li>
			</ul>
				
			<p class="bodytext">

				include these and other components in an

			<h2>The motivating e-pet</h2>

			<p class="bodytext">
				In addition to having a good design, a 
				student-teacher contract, personal profiles, 
				and a system of feedback and reward, our 
				e-portfolio was intended to enhance student 
				motivation through the inclusion of an e-pet.
				The e-pet is based on the <em>Tamagotchi</em>, a toy 
				developed in Japan that responds to the

				actions of its owner. In its digital form, the 
				e-pet is an important feature for establishing 
				initial interest in e-portfolios and making 
				abandonment of the project more difficult.
			</p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				When students first register for the e-port-folio program, they are given a choice of four 
				animated eggs. The teacher explains that these 
				animated eggs will grow into e-pets depend-ing on the students’ work on their
				e-port-folios. Students can then name their pets; 
				names given include “Ohmario,” “Bobby,” 
				and “LLL.”
			</p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				Once a student chooses and names a pet, 
				it enters a lifecycle consisting of eight stages 
				dependent on the student’s e-portfolio work. 
				As the student works on the e-portfolio, the 
				egg will hatch and begin to develop into a 
				cute, animated cartoon animal. With each 
				submission of quality work for the portfolio, 
				the e-pet will grow and gain new powers, such 
				as the ability to fly. (To see sample e-pets, 
				visit: http://arts.kmutt.ac.th/eport/overview/
				petShow.html.)
			</p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				Table 1 shows how each of the eight lifecy-cle stages is activated by students; the quantity 
				and quality of students’ work on their port-folios affects the development of their e-pets. 
				While working on the e-portfolio, students 
				submit at least three worksheets containing 
				their reflections on learning; the higher the 
				score on the third worksheet, the healthier the 
				e-pet becomes. If, after submitting the three 
				worksheets, a student is not happy with the 
				progress of his or her e-pet, the student can 
				submit additional worksheets to increase the 
				health of the e-pet. In addition, guidance on 
				how to work on the portfolio is given through 
				written messages apparently originating from 
				the e-pet, and if students do not log in to the 
				e-portfolio for a month, they will receive a 
				startling reminder email from their pet that it 
				is “close to death.”

			<h2>Evaluating the e-pet</h2>

			<p class="bodytext">
				How did the desire to develop their e-pet 
				and prevent its death affect students’ work on 
				their e-portfolios? To answer this question, 
				we collected data from two sources: (1) journal entries written by the teacher after each 
				lesson, and (2) questionnaires answered by 
				64 students from two classes.
			</p>

			<p><strong>Teacher's journal results</strong></p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				When students first register for the e-portfolio project, they have to choose an egg, a task 
				that generates intense initial interest, which is 
				reflected in the teacher’s journal entry:
			</p>

			<p class="journal">
				Choosing an egg and naming it wasn’t 
				as simple as I thought it would be. 
				Students were asking questions and 
				sharing information among themselves. 
				When someone found that they chose 
				the same egg as their friends, they 
				seemed satisfied. The most asked questions were “What will the pet be like?” 
				and “What is the difference between 
				the pink egg and the green one?” I 
				told them to work on their portfolio 
				and they would see the development 
				of their pet.
			</p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				As the students worked on their e-portfolios, the e-pet became a crucial motivating 
				factor. Another comment from the teacher’s 
				diary:
			</p>

			<p class="journal">
				It seems to me that students are competing with their friends to see whose 
				egg will hatch and whose will grow 
				first. Most students have already submitted their second or third worksheet, 
				which I think is amazing, and I have 
				never seen students working so quickly 
				when using the paper-based portfolio.
			</p>

			<p><strong>Student questionnaire results</strong></p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				The student questionnaire requested feed-back regarding all of the features of the
				e-portfolio project. The results clearly show that the 
				inclusion of an e-pet was highly motivating, 
				including naming and contributing to the 
				development of the pet. Importantly, the e-pet 
				appeared to motivate students to log in to the 
				e-portfolio program on a regular basis, as they 
				reported on the questionnaires:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					After I submitted my work, the egg	
					changed to be a little bee. When I work 
					on the computer with loudspeakers, I 
					can hear the sound of the pet, which I 
					think is cute—and it’s very cute when 
					it moves. This makes me enjoy the 
					program. Sometimes I log in to the 
					program to see if my pet has grown.
				</li>

				<li>
					I	chose	the	purple	egg.	I	think	it	may	
					be a frog. It has a tail now. I want to 
					see what it will become. I often log in 
					to the program because I want to know 
					what my pet will be like.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="bodytext">
				Because students log on so often, the 
				feedback from teachers should be prompt and 
				meaningful. In addition, teachers should be 
				prepared for an increase in assignments from 
				students who turn in extra work to develop 
				their e-pets. Instead of completing only the 
				three required worksheets, some students submitted up to nine worksheets in the hope of 
				gaining higher marks to help their e-pet grow. 
				This is reflected in the student comments:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					I	prefer	to	enjoy	my	work	rather	than	
					working seriously. The pet makes me 
					feel not too serious. If I want the pet to 
					grow, I will work more.
				</li>

				<li>
					I	feel	that	my	pet	should	have	grown	
					more. I think it can grow more than 
					this. I think it motivates me to work 
					more because I want to see what my pet 
					will be like when it grows.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="bodytext">
				From our experience, e-portfolios are a 
				valuable tool for supporting English language 
				learning. Motivating students is a key issue 
				in using e-portfolios, and, in our case, both 
				the teacher’s observation and the students’ 
				responses indicate that the e-pet has a major 
				motivational role. The initial interest created by the e-pet was nurtured and sustained 
				because students found it difficult to abandon 
				the e-portfolio project.

			<h2>Designing an e-portfolio project</h2>

			<p class="bodytext">
				For teachers who are comfortable with

			<p class="bodytext">
				An alternative to designing an e-portfolio 
				from scratch is to use the portfolio module in 
				the open source learning management system 
				Moodle. (For a demonstration, see http://docs.
				moodle.org/en/Portfolio_module and http://
				moodle.spdc.org/moofolio.)
			</p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				Although e-pets are difficult to transfer 
				to non-electronic media, some of the fea-tures of the e-portfolio are easily adapted for 
				paper-based portfolios. Learner contracts are 
				a common educational technique, as is using 
				stars or coins as rewards and acknowledging the best students in a manner similar to 
				how companies acknowledge employees of 
				the month. As an alternative reward system, 
				teachers could give cards related to popular 
				culture as a reward, either with the goal of 
				collecting a complete set of cards about a 
				particular topic, or as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle 
				that together become a picture of some cultural icon.;

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>

			<p class="bodytext">
				Teaching and assessing an e-portfolio project requires students to undertake a substantial 
				amount of independent work. The design and 
				application of such a project can be a challenge 
				for teachers, who might have problems getting 
				students to show and maintain interest in the 
				project. The challenge is lessened when the 
				components of an e-portfolio—including the 
				e-pet—are attractive to students. We found 
				that the e-pet is an effective way to initiate 
				and maintain student interest. We hope that 
				the information presented in this article will 
				encourage other teachers to develop innovative ways to stimulate motivation and effective 
				independent learning.
