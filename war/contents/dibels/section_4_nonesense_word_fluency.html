					<h2>Description</h2>

					<p class="bodytext">
						<u>DIBELS<span class="reference">TM</span> Nonsense Word Fluency (NWF)</u>
						is a standardized, individually-administered 
						test of the alphabetic principle – including letter-sound correspondence and of the ability to blend 
						letters into words in which letters represent their most common sounds (Kaminski & Good, 
						1996). The student is presented an 8.5” x 11” sheet of paper with randomly ordered VC and 
						CVC nonsense words (e.g., <u>sig</u>, <u>rav</u>, <u>ov</u>) and asked to produce verbally the individual letter sound 
						of each letter or verbally produce, or read, the whole nonsense word. For example, if the stimulus 
						word is “vaj” the student could say /v/ /a/ /j/ or say the word /vaj/ to obtain a total of three
						letter-sounds correct. The student is allowed 1 minute to produce as many letter-sounds as he/she can, 
						and the final score is the number of letter-soundsproduced correctly in one minute. Because the 
						measure is fluency based, students receive a higher score if they are phonologically recoding the 
						word and receive a lower score if they are providing letter sounds in isolation. The NWF 
						measure takes about 2 minutes to administer and has over 20 alternate forms for monitoring 
						progress. The one-month, alternate-form reliability for NWF in January of first grade is .83 
						(Good et al., in preparation). The concurrent criterion-validity of DIBELS<span class="reference">TM</span>
						NWF with the 
						Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised Readiness Cluster score is .36 in 
						January and .59 in February of first grade (Good etal., in preparation). The predictive validity of 
						DIBELS<span class="reference">TM</span> NWF in January of first grade with (a) CBM ORF in May of first
						grade is .82, (b) 
						CBM ORF in May of second grade is .60, (c) Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery 
						Total Reading Cluster score is .66 (Good et al., in preparation). The benchmark goal for 
						Nonsense Word Fluency is 50 correct letter sounds per minute by mid first grade. Students 
						scoring below 30 in mid first grade may need intensive instructional support to achieve first 
						grade reading goals.

						<u>Discontinue Rule.</u> If the student does not get any sounds correct in words 1-5, discontinue
