			<h1>DIBELS<span class="reference">TM</span> Approved Accommodations</h1>

			<p class="bodytext">
				The purpose of accommodations is to facilitate assessment for children for whom a 
				standard administration may not provide an accurate estimate of their skills in the core early 
				literacy skill areas. Assessment and accommodations toassessment should be consistent with the 
				primary goal of accurately estimating the child’s skills in phonemic awareness, phonics or 
				alphabetic principle, accuracy and fluency with connected text, reading comprehension, and 
				vocabulary development.
			</p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				DIBELS approved accommodations are accommodations that are unlikely to change 
				substantially the meaning or interpretation of scores on the measures or the target skill being 
				assessed by the measure. When DIBELS approved accommodations are used, the regular 
				DIBELS interpretation guidelines apply, and the scores can be entered into the DIBELS Data 
				System for reporting and interpretation. The “Tested with DIBELS Approved
				Accommodations” box should be checked in the student demographics section.
			</p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				When the DIBELS assessments are administered in ways different from both a DIBELS 
				standard administration and the DIBELS approved accommodations, the administration would 
				be considered an unstandardized administration and the resulting scorescannot be interpreted 
				with the DIBELS interpretive and reporting procedures. Scores from a nonstandard 
				administration using unapproved accommodations should not be entered into the DIBELS Data 
				System for reporting and analysis. For example, extended time or un-timed administration would 
				notbe a DIBELS Approved Accommodation. For the DIBELS measures, fluency is an integral 
				aspect of the construct being assessed. Scoresfrom an un-timed administration would not be 
				comparable or interpretable withthe procedures for reporting and interpreting DIBELS scores. 
				An interventionist may elect to administer the DIBELS in an un-timed way, but the scores should 
				not be entered into the DIBELS Data System, the reliability and validity data for DIBELS would 
				not be applicable, and the benchmark goals would not be relevant or appropriate.

			<h1>Changes in Test Administration and Scoring that are Not Approved Accommodations</h1>

			<p class="bodytext">
				Timing. Changes in the timing of DIBELS assessments or un-timed administrations are 
				not approved accommodations. If the DIBELSmeasures are administered under un-timed 
				conditions or with extended time, the scores should not be entered into the DIBELS Data 
				System. In addition, the research establishing the reliability and validity of the measures would 
				not apply to un-timed or extended time administrations. In addition, the scoring guidelines for 
				interpreting level of risk and for making instructional recommendations would not apply.
