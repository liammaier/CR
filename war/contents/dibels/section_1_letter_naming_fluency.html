					Letter Naming Fluency (LNF) is intended for most children from fall of kindergarten 
					through fall of first grade. A benchmark goal is not provided for LNF because it does not 
					correspond to a big idea of earlyliteracy skills (phonological awareness, alphabetic principle, 
					and accuracy and fluency with connected text) and does not appear to beessential to achieve 
					reading outcomes. However, students in the lowest 20 percent ofa school district using local 
					norms should be considered at risk for poorreading outcomes, and those between the 20
					<span class="reference">th</span> percentile and 40<span class="reference">th</span>
					percentile should be considered at some risk. For students at risk, the primary 
					instructional goals should be in phonological awareness, alphabeticprinciple, and accuracy and 
					fluency with connected text.

				<h2>Description</h2>

				<p class="bodytext">
					<u>DIBELS Letter Naming Fluency (LNF)</u> is a standardized, individually administered test 
					that provides a measure of risk. Students are presented with a page of upper- and lower-case 
					letters arranged in a random order and are asked to name as many letters as they can. LNF is 
					based on research by Marston and Magnusson (1988). Students are told if they do not know a 
					letter they will be told the letter. The studentis allowed 1 minute to produce as many letter 
					names as he/she can, and the score is the number of letters named correctly in 1 minute. Students 
					are considered <u>at risk</u> for difficulty achieving early literacy benchmark goals if they perform in 
					the lowest 20% of students in their district. That is, below the 20<span class="reference">th</span>
					percentile using local district norms. Students are considered at <u>some risk</u> if they perform between the
					20<span class="reference">th</span> and 40<span class="reference">th</span> percentile 
					using local norms. Students are considered at <u>low risk</u> if they perform above the
					40<span class="reference">th</span> percentile
					using local norms. The 1-month, alternate-form reliability of LNF is .88 in kindergarten (Good et 
					al., in preparation). The median criterion-related validity of LNF with the Woodcock-Johnson 
					Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised Readiness Cluster standard score is.70 in kindergarten 
					(Good et al., in preparation). The predictive validity of kindergarten LNF with first-grade 
					Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised Reading Cluster standard score is .65, 
					and .71 with first-grade Curriculum-Based Measurement (CBM) oral reading fluency (Good et 
					al., in preparation).

				<h2>Directions for Administration</h2>

				<ol>
					<li>Place the student copy of probe in front of the student.</li>

					<li>Place the examiner probe on clipboard and position so that the student cannot see what you record.</li>

					<li>
						Say these specific directions to the student:

						<p class="instructions">
							Here are some letters <span class="plain">(point)</span>.Tell me the names of as many letters as you 
							can. When I say “begin”, start here <span class="plain">(point to first letter)</span>, and go across the 
							page <span class="plain">(point)</span>. Point to each letter and tell me the name of that letter. If you 
							come to a letter you don’t know I’ll tell it to you. Put your finger on the 
							first letter. Ready, begin.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>Start your stop watch.</li>

					<li>
						Follow along on the examiner probe. Put a slash (<img class="verticalcenteredimage" src="/contents/dibels/images/strikethrough.png">)
						through letters named incorrectly (see scoring procedures)
					</li>

					<li>
						If the student provides the letter sound rather than the letter name, say, <strong><em>“Remember to tell me 
						the letter name, not the sound it makes.”</em></strong> This prompt may be provided <u>once</u> during the 
						administration. If the student continues providingletter sounds, mark each letter as incorrect 
						and indicate what the student did at the bottom of the page.
					</li>

					<li>
						At the end of <u>1 minute</u>, place a bracket (<strong>]</strong>) after the last
						letter named and say, <strong><em>“Stop.”</em></strong>

					<li>
						<u>Discontinue Rule.</u> If the student does notget any correct letter names within the first 10 
						letters (1 row), discontinue the task and record a score of 0.
					</li>

					<li><u>3 second rule.</u> If the student hesitates for 3 seconds on a letter, score the letter incorrect, 
						provide the correct letter, point to the next letter, and say <strong><em>“What letter?”</em></strong> This prompt may 
						be repeated. For example, if the letters are “t L s” and the student says, “t” (3 seconds), 
						prompt by saying, “L” (point to s) <strong><em>“What letter?”</em></strong>

						<u>Articulation and dialect.</u> The student is not penalized for imperfect pronunciation due to

						says /th/ for /s/ and pronounces “thee” for “see” when naming the letter “C”, he/she should 
						be given credit for naming letter correctly. This is a professional judgment and should be 
						based on the student’s responses and any prior knowledge of his/her speech patterns.
