					DIBELS Oral Reading Fluency is intended for most children from mid first grade 
					through third grade. The benchmark goals are 40 inspring of first grade, 90 in spring of second 
					grade, and 110 in the spring of third grade. Students may need intensive instructional support if 
					they score below 10 in spring of first grade, below 50 in spring of second grade, and below 70 in

					<h2>Description</h2>

					<p class="bodytext">
						<u>DIBELS<span class="reference">TM</span> Oral Reading Fluency (DORF)</u> is a standardized,
						individually administered 
						test of accuracy and fluency with connected text. The DORF passages and procedures are based 
						on the program of research and development ofCurriculum-Based Measurement of reading by 
						Stan Deno and colleagues at the University of Minnesota and using the procedures described in 
						Shinn (1989). A version of CBM Reading alsohas been published as The Test of Reading 
						Fluency (TORF) (Children’s Educational Services, 1987). DORF is a standardized set of 
						passages and administration procedures designed to (a) identify children who may need 
						additional instructional support, and (b) monitor progress toward instructional goals. The 
						passages are calibrated for the goal level of reading for each grade level. Student performance is 
						measured by having students read a passage aloud for one minute. Words omitted, substituted, 
						and hesitations of more than three seconds are scored as errors. Words self-corrected within three 
						seconds are scored as accurate. The number of correct words per minute from the passage is the 
						oral reading fluency rate.
					<p>
					
					<p class="bodytext">	
						A series of studies has confirmed the technical adequacy of CBM Reading procedures in 
						general. Test-retest reliabilities for elementary students ranged from .92 to .97; alternate-form 
						reliability of different reading passages drawn from the same level ranged from .89 to .94 
						(Tindal, Marston, & Deno, 1983). Criterion-related validity studied in eight separate studies in 
						the 1980s reported coefficients ranging from .52 - .91 (Good & Jefferson, 1998).

					<p class="bodytext">						
						<u>DIBELS<span class="reference">TM</span> Retell Fluency (RTF)</u> is intended to provide a comprehension
						check for the DORF assessment. In general, oral reading fluency provides one of the best measures of reading 
						competence, including comprehension, for children in first through third grades. The purpose of 
						the RTF measure is to (a) prevent inadvertentlylearning or practicing a misrule, (b) identify 
						children whose comprehension is not consistentwith their fluency, (c) provide an explicit

						linkage to the core components in the NRP report, and (d) increase the face validity of the 
						DORF.
					</p>

					<p class="bodytext">
						(1) The misrule that we want to prevent is that speed-reading without attending to 
						meaning is either desirable or the intent of the oral reading fluency measure. With a prompted 
						retell, children will be less likely to conclude that simply reading as fast as they can is the desired 
						behavior, and teachers will be less likely to imply that simply reading as fast as they can is 
						desired.
					</p>

						<p class="bodytext">
						(2) Teachers frequently are concerned about children who read fluently and do not 
						comprehend. My read of the data is that this pattern is infrequent - but may apply to some 
						children. It seems to me thisprocedure may identify those children without increasing unduly 
						the amount of time spent in the assessment.
					</p>

					<p class="bodytext">
						(3) The National Reading Panel (2000) report is clear on the core components of early 
						reading, and DIBELS maps explicitly onto the first three, Retell Fluency isincluded to provide a 
						brief measure that corresponds directly to the comprehension core component. The current oral 
						reading fluency measure corresponds about as well as anything to reading comprehension. 
						Retell Fluency provides an additional, explicit score that corresponds to the National Reading 
						Panel core components.
					</p>

					<p class="bodytext">
						(4) A primary concern teachers have about oralreading fluency is the face validity of the 
						measure. Incorporation of an explicit comprehension check may help teachers feel increasingly 
						comfortable with oral reading fluency.
					</p>

					<p class="bodytext">
						<u>Guidelines for Interpreting Retell Fluency.</u> Preliminary evidence indicates that the Retell 
						Fluency measures correlates with measures oforal reading fluency about .59. It appears 
						children’s retell scores may be typically about 50% of their oral reading fluency score, and that it 
						is unusual for children reading more than 40 words per minute to have a retell score 25% or less 
						than their oral reading fluency score. So, a rough rule of thumb may be that, for children whose 
						retell is about 50% of their oral reading fluency score, their oralreading fluency score provides a 
						good overall indication of their reading proficiency, including comprehension. But, for children 
						who are reading over 40 words per minute and whose retell score is 25% orless of their oral 
						reading fluency, their oral reading fluency score alone may not be providing a good indication of 
						their overall reading proficiency. For example, a child reading 60 words correct in one minute 
						would be expected to use about 30 words in their retell of the passage. If their retell is about 30, 
						then their oral reading fluency of 60 is providing a good indication of their reading skills. If their 
						retell is 15 or less, then there may be a comprehension concern that is not represented by their 
						fluency.
