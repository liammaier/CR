					<h2>Description</h2>

					<p class="bodytext">
						<u>DIBELS<span class="reference">TM</span> Phoneme Segmentation Fluency (PSF)</u> is a standardized,
						individually administered test of phonological awareness (Good & Kaminski, 2001). The PSF measure 
						assesses a student’s ability to segment three-and four-phoneme words into their individual 
						phonemes fluently. The PSF measure has been found to be a good predictor of later reading 
						achievement (Kaminski & Good, 1996). The PSF task is administered by the examiner orally 
						presenting words of three to four phonemes. Itrequires the student to produce verbally the 
						individual phonemes for each word. For example, the examiner says, “sat,” and the student says, 
						“/s/ /a/ /t/” to receive three possible points for the word. After the student responds, the examiner 
						presents the next word, and the number of correct produced in one minute determines 
						the final score. The PSF measure takes about 2 minutes to administer and has over 20 alternate 
						forms for monitoring progress. The two-week, alternate-form reliability for the PSF measure is 
						.88 (Kaminski & Good, 1996), and the one-month, alternate-form reliability is .79 in May of 
						kindergarten (Good et al., in preparation). Concurrent, criterion validityof PSF is .54 with the 
						Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery Readiness Cluster score in spring of 
						kindergarten (Good et al., in preparation). The predictive validity of spring-of-kindergarten PSF 
						with (a) winter-of-first-grade DIBELS NWF is.62, (b) spring-of-first-grade Woodcock-Johnson 
						Psycho-Educational Battery Total Reading Cluster score is .68, and (c) spring-of-first-grade 
						CBM ORF is .62 (Good et al., in preparation). The benchmark goal is 35 to 45 correct phonemes 
						per minute in the spring of kindergarten and fall offirst grade. Students scoring below 10 in the 
						spring of kindergarten and fall of first grade may need intensive instructional support to achieve 
						benchmark goals.

					<li>
						Give the student the first word and start your stopwatch. If the student does not say a sound 
						segment after <u>3 seconds</u>, give him/her the second word and score the first word as zero 
						segments produced.
					</li>

					<li>
						As the student says the sounds, mark the student response in the scoring column. Underline 
						each different, correct, sound segment produced. Put a slash
						(<img class="verticalcenteredimage" src="/contents/dibels/images/strikethrough.png">)
						through sounds produced incorrectly.

					<li>
						As soon as the student is finished saying the sounds, present the next word promptly and 
						clearly.

					<li>
						The maximum time for each sound segment is <u>3 seconds</u>. If the student does not provide the 
						next sound segment within <u>3 seconds</u>, give the student the next word. If student provides the 
						initial sound only, wait <u>3 seconds</u> for elaboration.
					</li>

					<li>
						At the end of <strong><u>1 minute</u></strong>, stop presenting words and scoring further responses.
						Add the number of sound segments produced correctly. Record the total number of sound segments 
						produced correctly on the bottom of the scoring sheet.

						<u>Correct Segmentation:</u> A correct sound segment is any different, correct, partof the word 
						represented by sounds that correspond to the word part. For example, the sound /t/ is a 
						correct sound segment of “trick,”as are /tr/ and /tri/ (see rule 10, Incomplete Segmentation).

						<u>Schwa sounds.</u> Schwa sounds (/u/) added to consonants are not counted as errors. Some

						says “tu...ru...i...ku” they would receive 4 of 4 points.

						<u>Articulation and dialect.</u> The student is not penalized for imperfect pronunciation due to 
						dialect, articulation, or second language interference. For example, if the student consistently
						says /th/ for /s/, and he or she says, /r/ /e/ /th/ /t/ for “rest,” he or she should be given credit 
						for correct segmentation. This is a professional judgment and should be based on the 
						student’s responses and any prior knowledge of his/her speech patterns.
