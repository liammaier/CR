					<h2>Description</h2>

					<p class="bodytext">
						<u>DIBELS<span class="reference">TM</span> Initial Sound Fluency (ISF)</u> is a standardized, individually administered 
						measure of phonological awareness that assesses a child’s ability to recognize and produce the 
						initial sound in an orally presented word (Kaminski & Good, 1998; Laimon, 1994). The 
						examiner presents four pictures to the child, names each picture, and then asks the child to 
						identify (i.e., point to or say) the picture that begins withthe sound produced orally by the 
						examiner. For example, the examiner says, “This is sink, cat, gloves, and hat. Which picture 
						begins with /s/?” and the student points to the correct picture. The child is also asked to orally 
						produce the beginning sound for an orally presented word that matches one of the given pictures. 
						The examiner calculates the amount of time taken to identify/produce the correct sound and 
						converts the score into the number of onsets correct in a minute.
					</p>

					<p class="bodytext">
						The ISF measure takes about 3 minutes to administer and has over 20 alternate forms to 
						monitor progress. The ISF measure is a revision of the Onset Recognition Fluency (OnRF) 
						measure incorporating minimal revisions. Alternate-form reliability of the OnRF measure is .72 
						in January of kindergarten (Good, Kaminski, Shinn, Bratten, Shinn, & Laimon, in preparation). 
						By repeating the assessment four times, the resulting average is estimated to have a reliability of 
						.91 (Nunnally, 1978). The concurrent, criterion-related validity of OnRF with DIBELS PSF is 
						.48 in January of kindergarten and .36 with the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery 
						Readiness Cluster score (Good et al., in preparation). The predictive validity of OnRF with 
						respect to spring-of-first-grade reading on CBM ORF is .45, and .36 with the Woodcock-Johnson 
						Psycho-Educational Battery Total Reading Cluster score (Good et al., in preparation). The

						<u>Correct Initial Consonant Sound:</u> If the word starts with aninitial consonant sound, the child

						<u>Correct Initial Vowel Sound:</u> If the word starts with an initial vowel sound, the child can 
						respond with the initial vowel sound or initial sounds. For example, if the word is “elephant” 
						a correct initial sound would be /e/ or /el/ or /ele/, but not the name of the letter /ea/.

						<u>Articulation Difficulty:</u> The student is not penalized for imperfect pronunciation due to 
						dialect, articulation, or second language interference. For example, the student responds /th/ 
						when asked for the first sound in “sink.” If the student <u>consistently</u> says /th/ for /s/, as in 
						“thircle” for “circle,” he or she should be given credit for a correct initial sound. This is a 
						professional judgment and should be based on the student’s responses and any prior
