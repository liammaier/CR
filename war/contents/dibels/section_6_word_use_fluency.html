				<p class="bodytext">
					Word Use Fluency (WUF) is intended for most children from fall of kindergarten through 
					third grade. A benchmark goal is not provided for WUF because additional research is needed to 
					establish its linkage to other big ideas of early literacy (phonological awareness, alphabetic 
					principle, and accuracy and fluency with connectedtext). Tentatively, students in the lowest 20 
					percent of a school district using local norms should be consideredat risk for poor language and 
					reading outcomes, and those between the 20<span class="reference">th</span> percentile and
					40<span class="reference">th</span> percentile should be considered at some risk.

						<span class="instructions">OK. Here is your first word.</span>
					</li>

					<li>
						Give the student the first word and start your stopwatch. If the student does not begin to use 
						the word after <u>5 seconds</u>, give him/her the second word and score the first word as zero.
					</li>

					<li>
						Provide the next word when the student has used the word in a phrase, expression, or 
						utterance or when the student hesitates or pauses for <u>5 seconds</u>. As soon as the student is 
						finished using the word, present the next word promptly and clearly.
					</li>

					<li>
						At the end of <strong><u>1 minute</u></strong>, stop presenting words and recording further
						responses. Count the 
						number of words used correctly in phrases, expressions, or sentences, and record at the end 
						of the row. Total these scores and record at the bottom of the scoring sheet.

				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong><em>The total score will be the total number of words used correctly in an utterance. An 
						utterance may be a phrase, expression, definition, or sentence. For each target word, the 
						words in the final and/or most complete utterance will be counted.</em></strong>
					</li>

					<li>
						<u>Number of words.</u> Count the number of words the child produces in response to a word by 
						moving your pen through the numbers as the student is responding. Try to record accurately 
						the number of words in the student’s response. Put a circle around the total number of words 
						in the student’s response.

						<ul>
							<li>Count only actual words, not exclamations such as “um.”</li>

							<li>Score contractions (e.g., “She’s,” “We’ll”) as one word.</li>

							<li>
								Words do not include songs or recitations (e.g., the ABC's and 1, 2, 3, etc.) 
								performed either individually or in a group.
							</li>

							<li>
								If a child perseverates on a word (e.g., “beep, beep, beep, beep”), count the word 
								as a single-word utterance (if it is the only word stated by a child) or as one word 
								in a multi-word utterance.
							</li>
						</ul>

						Example: If the word is “stone” and the student says “I threw the stone in the water.” Move 
						your pen through the numbers as the studentresponds and circle the total words.

						<img src="/contents/dibels/images/40fig01.png">
					</li>

					<li>
						<u>Correct utterance.</u> Mark the usage of the word in an utterance as correct or incorrect. <em>Correct 
						utterances are scored liberally. If the utterance conveys the accurate meaning of the word 
						and could be correct, score it as correct.</em> A response is consideredcorrect when it meets the 
						requirement for either correct use, or correct definition.

						<ul>
							<li>
								Correct Use: For an utterance to be considered correct in terms of use, the target 
								word is used correctly in a phrase, expression, or sentence.
							</li>

							<li>
								Correct Definition: Correct definitions are accepted as a correct utterance. 
								Correct definitions do not need to contain the target word to be accepted as 
								correct. Synonyms are considered definitions.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						<u>Total number of words in correct utterances.</u> At the end of 1 minute, add up the number of 
						words in each correct utterance toobtain the total number of words in correct utterances. 
						<em>Note, do not count words used in incorrect responses. Count the number of words used in 
						correct utterances only.</em>

				<h2>Correct use</h2>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<u>Correct use.</u> If the word is used in a phrase, expression or sentence and conveys the meaning 
						of the word, the response is correct. 

						<p>
							Example: If the word is “stone” and the student says “I threw the stone in the water.” Circle 
							the total words, mark the utterance as correct, and write the total number of words in the 
							blank.
						</p>

						<p>
							Example: If the word is “school” and the student says, “I like school because it’s fun.” Circle

							blank.
						</p>

						<img src="/contents/dibels/images/41fig02.png">

					<li>
						<u>False starts within a correct use are not counted.</u>

						<p>
							Example, if the word is “school” and the student says, “School. I like school. I like school 
							because it’s fun.” Score the final/most completeutterance only. Circle the number of words 
							in the final utterance, mark the utterance as correct, and write the total number of words in 
							the blank.

						<u>Correct definition is scored as a correct use.</u> A correct definition or synonym conveys the

							Example: If the word is “stone” and the student says “Something that is round and hard.” 
							Circle the total words, mark the utterance as correct, and write the total number of words in

				<h2>Incorrect Usage</h2>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<u>Incorrect response.</u> The target word is used in the response, but the response does not make

					<li>
						<u>Repeating the target wordis not a correct use.</u> Simply repeating the word, does not convey
