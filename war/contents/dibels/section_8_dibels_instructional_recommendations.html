			<p class="bodytext">
				The purpose of this technical report is to provide a compilation of the Dynamic Indicators 
				of Basic Early Literacy Skills<span class="reference">TM</span> (DIBELS<span class="reference">TM</span>,
				Good & Kaminski, 2002) decision rules for 
				intensive, strategic, and benchmark instructional recommendations. These decision rules 
				represent a revision of the initial decision rules used in the DIBELS Data System. The initial 
				decision rules focused on the longitudinal predictivevalidity of specific benchmark goals: Initial 
				Sound Fluency (ISF) in middle of kindergarten, Phoneme Segmentation Fluency (PSF) at the end 
				of kindergarten, Nonsense Word Fluency (NWF) in middle of first grade, and DIBELS Oral 
				Reading Fluency (DORF) at the end of first, second, and third grades. The revised decision rules 
				utilize the longitudinal predictive information fromall participants in the DIBELS Data System 
				to identify progressive benchmark goals en route to the initial goals. Within-academic-year 
				predictive utilities are based on all schools participating in the DIBELS Data System during the 
				2001 – 2002 academic year. For example, the predictive utility of a beginning kindergarten 
				recommendation for an end of kindergarten goal would be a within-yearutility. Across year 
				predictive utilities are based on all schools participating in the DIBELS Data System during the 
				2000 – 2001 and 2001 – 2002 academic years. For example, the predictive utility of a beginning 
				kindergarten recommendation for an end of first grade goal would be an across-year predictive 
				utility.

			<p class="bodytext">
				In establishing the DIBELS decision rules and instructional recommendations, we 
				followed some general rules and principles. A first guiding principle is that we wanted to 
				establish cutoffs and goals for healthy reading outcomes where the odds would be in favor of 
				achieving subsequent early literacy goals and outcomes. For individual indicators, the level of 
				performance where the odds are in favor of achieving subsequent outcomes was referred to as 
				<em>low risk</em> if the measure was administered prior to the benchmark goal and it was referred to as 
				<em>established</em> if the measure was administered at the time of the benchmark goal or after.
				When all 
				available information from the DIBELS Benchmark Assessment is considered and an overall 
				recommendation made, patterns of performance with the odds in favor of achieving subsequent 
				goals received a recommendation of <em>Benchmark - At grade level</em>. In general, we tried to 
				establish cutoffs and rules where the odds in favor of achieving subsequent goals meant that 
				approximately 80% or more of students withthe pattern would achieve the goal.
			</p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				A secondary goal of the decision rules was to identify students with the odds against 
				achieving subsequent early literacy goals for whomintervention would be indicated. We tried to 
				establish cutoffs where the odds against meant thatapproximately 20% or fewer of students with 
				the pattern would achieve subsequent goals. For individual indicators, the level of performance 
				where the odds are against achieving subsequent goals was referred to as <em>at risk</em> if the measure 
				was administered prior to the benchmark goal, and <em>deficit</em> if the measure was administered
				at the 
				benchmark goal or later. An instructional recommendation based on all of the DIBELS

				Benchmark Assessment measures for students withthe odds against achieving subsequent goals 
				was Intensive - <em>Needs Substantial Intervention</em>.
			</p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				The third level of performance was when a clear prediction was not possible. In this 
				case, the odds would be neither in favor nor against. We tried to establish cutoffs for the middle 
				category where approximately 50% of students achieved subsequent early literacy goals. For 
				individual indicators, the middle category was referred to as some riskprior to a benchmark goal, 
				and <em>emerging</em> at a benchmark goal or later. When the pattern of performance across all of the 
				DIBELS Benchmark Assessment measures does notyield a clear prediction, i.e., 50 – 50 odds, 
				the instructional recommendation was <em>Strategic - Additional Intervention</em>. 
			</p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				On an individual measure basis, multiple factors were considered when establishing the 
				cutoff points. The primary consideration was the odds of achieving subsequent early literacy 
				goals. An additional factor that was considered was the percent of students in each decision 
				category. A rough target was 20 percent to be identified as at risk or intensive, and 20 percent 
				identified as some risk or strategic. A rough goal of effective reform would be 5 percent 
				requiring intensive instructional intervention and 15% requiring strategic instructional support so 
				that 100% achieve benchmark early literacy goals. 
			</p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				For each individual measure, Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves were 
				examined to identify the tradeoff in sensitivity and specificity for possible cutoff scores. For 
				each measure, ROC curves were generated and evaluated for relevant subsequent benchmark 
				goals. For example, in the beginning of kindergarten, ROC curves were examined for 4 
				benchmark goals: (a) ISF in middle of kindergarten, (b) PSF in end of kindergarten, (c) NWF in 
				middle of first grade, and (d) DORF in end of first grade. For each measure and each benchmark 
				goal, 2 ROC curves were considered: (a) with respect to a goal outcome of reading health (i.e., 
				odds in favor of achieving subsequent goals), and (b) with respect to a goal outcome of reading 
				difficulty (i.e., the level of the goal with odds against achieving subsequent goals). So, for 
				example, for ISF at the beginning of kindergarten, 8 different ROC curves were considered and 
				evaluated. 
			</p>

			<p class="bodytext">
				An additional consideration in establishing DIBELS decision rules and instructional 
				recommendations was the theoretical structure and linkage of beginning reading skills with 
				respect to literacy outcomes. Needless to say, it was seldom possible to establish a decision rule 
				that satisfied all of these factors and considerations equally. A tradeoff ofdesirable features was 
				frequently required. The overarching priority was to establish instructional recommendations 
				and instructional goals where the odds are in favor of achieving subsequent literacy outcomes. 
				Complete information on the development and specification of these decision rules is in 
				preparation as CIRCUITS Technical Reports 1 through 11 and should be available by January, 
				2003.

					The specific cutoffs for the DIBELS Benchmark Assessment measures in the beginning

					The cut scores for the middle of kindergarten benchmark assessment are reported in 
					Table 3, and the corresponding instructional recommendations for all patterns of performance are 
					reported in Table 4. The NWF measure is optional in middle of kindergarten, and so it is not 
					incorporated in the patterns ofperformance and corresponding instructional recommendations. 
					In the middle of kindergarten, the benchmark goalis 25 or better on ISF so descriptors for ISF 
					are established, emerging, and benchmark. For the other measures, there is no instructional 
					benchmark goal (LNF) or the measures are administered before the benchmark goal (PSF, NWF) 
					so the descriptors are at risk, some risk, and low risk. 
				<p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					The instructional recommendations in Table 4 are based on the pattern of performance on 
					ISF, LNF, and PSF. The goal is established skills on ISF in the middle of kindergarten, and 
					some patterns with established ISF skills have very good odds of achieving later reading goals. 
					For example, for children who have established initial sounds on ISF and who are low risk on 
					LNF and PSF, the odds are 93 percent of achieving the first grade DORF goal. For other 
					patterns with established initial sounds on ISF, the odds are much lower resulting in 
					recommendations of strategic instructional support. For example, students with established skills 
					on ISF but who are at risk on LNF and PSF have odds of only 31 percent of achieving the first 
					grade DORF benchmark goal. However, ISF established, LNF at risk, and PSF at risk is an 
					extremely rare and implausible pattern. When a student is very proficient with initial sounds, 
					they should be scoring much higher than 7 on the phoneme segmentation fluency measure, in 
					particular.

					The cutoff scores for risk and established skills for the beginning of first grade are 
					summarized in Table 7. A summer effect is apparent in that NWF of 25 is required for low risk 
					at the end of kindergarten, but NWF of 24 is sufficient for low risk atthe beginning of first 
					grade. A similar pattern is noticeable for LNF. The instructional recommendation for each 
					pattern of performance at the beginning of first grade is provided in Table 8. As with the end of 
					kindergarten patterns, established skills on PSF and low risk on NWF appear to be important 
					instructional targets for students to be on track for reading outcomes. Even for students who are 
					at risk on LNF, if they achieve the 35 on PSF and 24 on NWF, the odds are 56 percent of 
					achieving the first grade reading goal (an unusual pattern with a strategic support instructional 
					recommendation).

				<p class="bodytext">
					In the middle of first grade, the cut scoresfor established skills and risk status are 
					summarized in Table 9. The instructional recommendations corresponding to patterns of 
					performance in the middle of first grade are summarized in Table 10. The benchmark goal for 
					the middle of first grade is a score of 50 or moreon the NWF measure. For the most part, it is 
					extremely rare for a student to have established skills on NWF and less than established skills on 
					PSF. In addition to established skills on NWF, it also appears important that students are 
					beginning to apply those skills inconnected text reading at least 20 correct words per minute on 
					the DORF measure. For students with established skills on NWF and who are reading at least 20 
					words correct per minute, the odds of achieving the first grade reading outcomes are 97 to 100 
					percent. However, even if students have established skills on PSF and NWF, if they are reading 
					fewer than 20 words correct per minute, their odds of achieving the first grade reading goal fall 
					to 24 or 49 percent (with an instructional recommendation of strategic support). Students with 
					combined risk factors in NWF and DORF are likely to require intensive intervention to achieve 
					first grade reading outcomes. 
				</p>

				<p class="bodytext">
					In the middle of first grade the ordering of DIBELS performance patterns does not follow 
					exactly the conditional percent achieving reading outcomes. In particular, 100 percent of 
					students with a deficit on PSF, established on NWF, and low risk on DORF achieved the first 
					grade reading goal. However, that pattern was extremely rare and we decided to rank it below 
					the similar patterns with higher phonemic awareness skills. A similar change in ordering of 
					patterns was done for emerging NWF and low risk on DORF.

					At the end of first grade, instructional recommendations are based directly on DORF 
					reading level. Students who meet the DORF goal of 40 or more words correct per minute are 
					likely to have established PSF and NWF skills as well. Reading 40 or more words correct per 
					minute and displaying a deficit in either PSF or NWF is an extremely rare pattern, and indicates 
					a need to retest the students’skills on PSF and NWF if there is any concern about their 
					performance. Students who meet the end of first grade benchmark goal on DORF have odds of 
					75 to 92 percent of achieving the second grade goal for more common patterns of performance. 
					Students who are reading below 20 words correct per minute at the end of first grade are at risk 
					for reading difficulty in second grade with oddsof 10 to 18 percent of achieving the second 
					grade reading goal for more common patterns. For students reading less than 20 words correct at 
					the end of first grade, substantial, intensive instructional intervention is recommended.

					The recommended beginning of second grade cut scores for low risk and at risk are 
					reported in Table 13 along with the accompanying instructional recommendation. The beginning 
					of second grade cut scores are not directly comparable to the end offirst grade cutoffs. Both the 
					at risk score and the low risk score are higher at the beginning of second grade. In part, the 
					higher scores are due to the need for continual growth in reading skills inorder for a student to 
					be on track for successful reading outcomes. The end of first grade encompasses the final 3 
					months of first grade. The beginning of second grade includes the first 3 months of second grade. 
					Students should be making continual progress overthat span of time. The higher cutoff scores 
					are also due to more rigorous cutoffs. At the end of first grade, the cutoffs of 20 and 40 
					correspond to the 13<span class="reference">th</span> and 35<span class="reference">th</span>
					percentiles, respectively. In the beginning of second grade, the 
					cutoffs of 26 and 44 correspond to the 20<span class="reference">th</span>
					and 40<span class="reference">th</span>
					percentiles, respectively. However, the odds 
					of achieving second grade reading goals are similar for students with an intensive instructional 
					recommendation: 6 percent at end of first grade, 10 percent in beginning of second. The odds 
					also are similar for students with a benchmark instructional recommendation: 90% at end of first 
					grade, 89 percent in the beginning of second grade. The odds of achieving subsequent 
					benchmark goals were the primary consideration in establishing cutoff scores.

					receiving a rating of “meets expectations” or“exceeds expectations” on the Oregon Statewide 
					Assessment Test were 96 percent if students scored in the low risk or benchmark range on the

					This technical report is intended to make public the decision rules used in the DIBELS

					indicators of risk and as instructional goals. At any point in time, students who are at risk at that 
					point in time have the odds seriously against achieving subsequentearly literacy goals – unless 
					they are provided with substantial, sustained, intensive intervention support. But, even more 
					important, for students prior to that point in time,the benchmark goal represents an instructional 
					target that will establish the odds in favor ofachieving subsequent early literacy goals.
