				The prevalence of dangerous strains of the human papillomavirus — the most
				common sexually transmitted infection in the United States and a principal
				cause of cervical cancer — has dropped by half among teenage girls in recent
				years, a striking measure of success for a vaccine against the virus that was
				introduced only in 2006, federal health officials said on Wednesday.

			<p>
				The sharp decline in the infection rate comes at a time of deepening worry
				among doctors and public health officials about the limited use of the HPV vaccine
				in the United States. Health departments across the country are scrambling for ways
				to increase vaccination rates, while nonprofit groups are using postcard reminders
				and social media campaigns and pediatricians are being encouraged to convince
				families of the vaccine’s benefits.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are some signs that resistance to the vaccine may be growing. A study
				published in the journal Pediatrics in March found that 44 percent of parents
				in 2010 said they did not intend to vaccinate their daughters, up from 40 percent
				in 2008. Because it prevents a sexually transmitted infection, the vaccine comes
				with a stigma. Some parents worry it promotes promiscuity. And it has been controversial.
				During the Republican primary in 2011, Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican
				of Minnesota, said the vaccine could have “dangerous side effects,” a concern that
				health officials say is unfounded.
			</p>

			<p>
				The magnitude of the decline in HPV infections surprised public health experts
				because only about a third of teenage girls in the United States have been vaccinated
				with the full course of three doses. By comparison, vaccination rates in countries
				like Denmark and Britain are above 80 percent. Even Rwanda, in East Africa, has
				reached 80 percent.
			</p>

			<p>
				Yet even with relatively low vaccination rates in the United States, infection
				with the viral strains that cause cancer dropped to 3.6 percent among girls ages
				14 to 19 in 2010, from 7.2 percent in 2006, the officials said.
			</p>

			<p>
				“These are striking results,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the Centers
				for Disease Control and Prevention. “They should be a wake-up call that we need to
				increase vaccination rates. The bottom line is this: It is possible to protect the
				next generation from cancer, and we need to do it.”
			</p>

			<p>
				The findings, published online Wednesday in The Journal of Infectious Diseases,
				covered the years 2003 to 2010 and were based on a national survey that is conducted
				every two years and is considered the gold standard on health indicators. Government
				health workers interviewed more than 8,000 girls and women ages 14 to 59 and collected
				vaginal swabs that were evaluated by the C.D.C.
			</p>

			<p>
				The infection rate for girls fell even further when the two strains of the virus that
				cause genital warts were included, with a 56 percent drop over the period of the
				study. The rate was flat in the years before the vaccine was introduced, giving
				researchers even more assurance that the vaccine was driving the decline. Health
				officials began monitoring HPV prevalence in boys only this year. The first data
				will be available in 2015.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are about 12,000 cases of cervical cancer and 4,000 deaths a year in the
				United States. At current vaccination rates, the vaccine would prevent 45,000
				cases of cervical cancer and 14,000 deaths among girls now age 13 and younger over
				the course of their lifetimes, according to C.D.C. estimates. Increasing the rate
				to 80 percent could prevent an additional 53,000 cancers and nearly 17,000 deaths.
			</p>

			<p>
				Federal officials on Wednesday sought to dispel fears about the vaccine, and emphasized
				its role in preventing cervical cancer.
			</p>

			<p>
				“This is an anticancer vaccine,” Dr. Frieden said.
			</p>

			<p>
				About 79 million Americans, most in their late teens and early 20s, are infected with
				HPV, or about a quarter of the American population. Each year, about 14 million people
				become infected. The virus causes about 19,000 cancers in women every year, and 8,000
				in men, according to the C.D.C. Cervical cancer is the most common among women; among
				men, throat cancer is most common.
			</p>

			<p>
				Health officials offered several possible explanations for why the drop was so sharp
				even though most girls in the United States are still not fully vaccinated.
			</p>

			<p>
				One possible reason is a phenomenon known as herd immunity, in which people who are
				vaccinated reduce the overall prevalence of the virus in society, decreasing the chances
				that unvaccinated people would be exposed to someone who is infected. Another is the
				unexpected effectiveness of a partial dosage of the HPV vaccine, said Dr. Lauri E. Markowitz,
				a medical epidemiologist at the C.D.C. and the lead author of the study. About half of
				teenage girls in the United States have received at least one dose of the vaccine.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because girls and women who got vaccinated tended to be more sexually active, compared
				with those who were not vaccinated, researchers suggest that those who had been contributing
				most to the prevalence of the infection were no longer infecting others.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are two HPV vaccines, one made by Merck for boys and girls, and one by GlaxoSmithKline,
				for girls. Experts recommended in 2007 that all girls get vaccinated, and extended that
				guidance to boys in 2011.
			</p>

			<p>
				Earlier data from the C.D.C. showed that Hispanic girls were more likely to be vaccinated
				than white girls, even though they were less likely to come from families with health
				insurance or to get regular medical care. That is partly because a federal program that
				covers vaccines for the poor and underserved gave the H.P.V. vaccine to clinics, while
				many patients with private insurance had high co-pays or had to pay the full price,
				generally up to $500 for a complete cycle of the vaccine.
			</p>

			<p>
				But cost will be less of an issue after the full implementation of President Obama’s
				health care law, which Dr. Frieden said requires providers to cover the vaccine at no
				cost to patients.
			</p>

			<p>
				Another obstacle to higher vaccination rates are doctors, who Dr. Frieden said are
				“not consistently giving strong recommendations for the vaccines, particularly for
				younger teens.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Dr. Amanda F. Dempsey, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado
				Denver, says most providers believe in the vaccine, but have met considerable resistance
				from parents, and feel that the brief time during visits may be better used on topics
				to which parents are more receptive.
			</p>

			<p>
				“You want to make the biggest impact,” said Dr. Dempsey, who recommends the vaccine
				to patients, but still gets a lot of refusals. Many parents do not believe their child
				is at risk because they are not sexually active, but she said that she explains that
				vaccination should happen long before exposure.
			</p>

			<p>
				She added, “For a lot of people there’s still a vague sense that there’s some
				controversy about the vaccine.”
