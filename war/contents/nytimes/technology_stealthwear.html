				THE term “stealth wear” sounded cool, if a bit extreme, when I first heard it early this
				year. It’s a catchy description for clothing and accessories designed to protect the
				wearer from detection and surveillance. I was amused. It seemed like an updated version
				of a tinfoil hat, albeit a stylish one.

				Fast-forward a few months. Flying surveillance cameras, also known as drones, are
				increasingly in the news. So are advances in facial-recognition technology. And wearable
				devices like Google Glass — which can be used to take photographs and videos and upload
				them to the Internet within seconds — are adding to the fervor. Then there are the disclosures
				of Edward Snowden, the fugitive former government contractor, about clandestine government
				surveillance.
			</p>

			<p>
				It’s enough to make counter surveillance fashion as timely and pertinent as any seasonal
				trend, like midriff tops or wedge sneakers.
			</p>

			<p>
				Adam Harvey, an artist and design professor at the School of Visual Arts and an early creator
				of stealth wear, acknowledges that counter surveillance clothing sounds like something out
				of a William Gibson novel.
			</p>

			<p>
				“The science-fiction part has become a reality,” he said, “and there’s a growing need for
				products that offer privacy.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Mr. Harvey exhibited a number of his stealth-wear designs and prototypes in an art show this
				year in London. His work includes a series of hoodies and cloaks that use reflective, metallic
				fabric — like the kind used in protective gear for firefighters — that he has repurposed to
				reduce person’s thermal footprint. In theory, this limits one’s visibility to aerial
				surveillance vehicles employing heat-imaging cameras to track people on the ground.
			</p>

			<p>
				He also developed a purse with extra-bright LEDs that can be activated when someone is taking
				unwanted pictures; the effect is to reduce an intrusive photograph to a washed-out blur.
				In addition, he created a guide for hairstyling and makeup application that might keep a
				camera from recognizing the person beneath the elaborate get-up. The technique is called
				CV Dazzle — a riff on “computer vision” and “dazzle,” a type of camouflage used during World
				War II to make it hard to detect the size and shape of warships.
			</p>

			<p>
				Mr. Harvey isn’t the only one working on such products. The National Institute of Informatics
				in Japan has developed a visor outfitted with LEDs whose light isn’t visible to the
				wearer — but that would blind some camera sensors and blur the details of a wearer’s nose and
				eyes more effectively than a pair of sunglasses.
			</p>

			<p>
				And Todd Blatt, a mechanical engineer in New York, is working on a lens-cap accessory for
				people who don’t want to be recorded while talking with someone who is wearing Google Glass.
				Instead of asking that the computer glasses be removed entirely, they could instead hand the
				wearer the lens covering. Presto. No taping or photographing would occur during the
				conversation.
			</p>

			<p>
				Mr. Harvey likened his work and that of others to the invention of the rivet in denim jeans.
				“That was a practical way of making them more durable,” he said. Stealth wear, he said,
				is an “updated way of thinking about making your clothes more resistant to your environment
				and adapting them to protect you a little bit more.”
			</p>

			<p>
				But these designers face a challenge: although technology has inspired some new fabrics
				and materials, high-tech fashion of any kind has yet to really take off.
			</p>

			<p>
				There simply isn’t much of a market for tech-savvy haute couture, said Becky Stern, an artist
				and the director of wearable electronics at Adafruit Industries, a company in New York that
				sells do-it-yourself electronics kits. Ms. Stern noted that a few years ago, clothing
				embedded with illuminated lights was relatively popular, but that interest later “kind
				of fell off.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Some of the most exciting experimentation is in the world of sports, she said, where
				athletic wear is being developed that can monitor a player’s vital signs. Such products
				are commercially viable, she said, and the technology could eventually migrate to clothing
				designed specifically to protect the privacy of its owner.
			</p>

			<p>
				Jan Chipchase, executive creative director of global insights at Frog Design, says he
				sees tremendous potential for an eventual stealth-wear market. He described current prototypes
				as “provocations,” saying they raise “issues that are impacting our cities and public
				spaces that need more discussion and debate.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Mr. Harvey’s items have not yet been thoroughly tested by intelligence firms or security
				experts. Most are still concepts, not ready for mass production. But he said he hoped that
				awareness of his designs might “empower you to control your identity a little more.”
			</p>

			<p>
				AND the mere fact that such designs are attracting attention online could pave the way for
				development of a mass market, said Joanne McNeil, a writer who covers Internet culture.
			</p>

			<p>
				On her blog “Internet of Dreams,” Ms. McNeil says that videos and mock-ups of not-yet-developed
				products, whether clothing or futuristic smartphones, are often popular online and may
				reflect the desires of a populace that larger corporations haven’t tapped.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Dreams outpace physical realities,” she said.
			</p>

			<p>
				In other words, even if stealth wear never becomes a viable or commercial reality, the
				newfound intrusiveness it responds to is genuine enough.
