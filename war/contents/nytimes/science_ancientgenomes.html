				Researchers have reconstructed an ancient genome that is 10 times as old as any
				retrieved so far, and they now say that DNA should be recoverable from animals
				that lived one million years ago. This would greatly extend biologists’ ability
				to understand the evolutionary past.

				The genome was that of a horse that lived about 700,000 years ago in what is now
				the Yukon Territory in Canada, and its reconstruction has already led to new insights.
				The researchers who sequenced it then analyzed DNA from a less ancient horse, one
				that lived 43,000 years ago, as well as five contemporary horse breeds and a donkey
				named Willy that resides in the Copenhagen Zoo. They concluded that the genus that
				gave rise to modern horses, zebras and donkeys — Equus — arose about four million
				years ago, twice as far back as had been thought.
			</p>

			<p>
				Before this work, the oldest genome that had been recovered was that of a Denisovan
				human who lived 70,000 years ago. The new finding, if accepted, would extend by
				tenfold the reach of paleogenomics, the study of ancient genomes reconstructed from
				fossil bones. Within the last few decades this young science has become a powerful
				complement to paleontology, the study of fossils, as a way of reconstructing
				evolutionary history.
			</p>

			<p>
				“I think the field has now in many respects matured,” said Svante Paabo of the Max
				Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, who solved many of the early problems
				and went on to reconstruct the genome of Neanderthals and more recently of the Denisovan
				human. “It is clear that with frozen material one can go far back in time, approaching
				a million years,” he said, but the challenge now was to retrieve ancient genomes from
				temperate zones, where important fossil bones are more plentiful.
			</p>

			<p>
				The horse DNA was extracted from a hind toe bone found in the Thistle Creek region of
				the Yukon’s Klondike gold mines. It owes its remarkable longevity to the bone having
				been buried in permafrost, which kept the DNA both very cold and very dry.
			</p>

			<p>
				The researchers who discovered the bone, Duane Froese of the University of Alberta
				and Eske Willerslev, an expert on ancient DNA at the University of Copenhagen, first
				estimated its date from the layers of volcanic ash where it was found. They also
				conducted tests that showed that the horse bone, despite its age, was likely to
				contain DNA, even though the chemical starts to degrade as soon as an animal dies.
			</p>

			<p>
				To help establish that the DNA from the horse bone was really 700,000 years old,
				Dr. Willerslev and Ludovic Orlando, a colleague at the University of Copenhagen,
				started an ambitious project to analyze the genomes of many other members of the
				horse evolutionary tree. These include the horse that lived 43,000 years ago, before
				horses were domesticated; a Przewalski’s horse, a species thought to represent the
				last living wild horse population; five domestic horse breeds (Arabian, Icelandic,
				Norwegian fjord, Standardbred and Thoroughbred); and Willy the donkey.
			</p>

			<p>
				Dr. Orlando said the range of genetic variation in the Thistle Creek bone lay
				outside that of all the other horses, showing it could not have been contaminated
				by modern horse DNA. Also, the DNA in the bone was much more fragmented than that
				of late ice age horse bones from the same region, indicating it was older.
				The geological evidence for the bone’s age is “very secure,” Dr. Orlando said.
				With this and other data he is confident that the Thistle Creek horse and its
				genome are indeed 700,000 years old.
			</p>

			<p>
				In a report published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, he and colleagues say
				that they have identified 29 regions in the genome of domestic horses where the
				DNA shows statistical evidence of selection, meaning that variant genes in these
				regions were favored as horses became domesticated. But each of the regions is
				about 200,000 DNA units in length and contains many genes, so the researchers do
				not yet know which of these genes was the target of selection, Dr. Orlando said.
			</p>

			<p>
				Another finding from the new collection of horse genome data is that the Przewalski’s
				horse shows no signs of having interbred with domestic horses, as some researchers
				had assumed was likely. Since the horse is threatened in the wild, this gives added
				reason for protecting it.
			</p>

			<p>
				The rich genomic data on the horse family tree has enabled the Danish team to make
				statistical estimates of the size of the horse population through the ages. In the
				last two million years, horses have gone through three cycles of a population increase
				followed by a crash. The most recent peak was during the last glacial maximum, a
				cold period 25,000 years ago that preceded the end of the last ice age. The reason
				seems to be that during cold periods there are extensive grasslands, but these
				revert to forest in warmer times. “When it’s fairly cold it’s good to be a horse,
				but when it’s warm it’s pretty bad,” Dr. Willerslev said Tuesday at news conference
				in Helsinki, Finland.
			</p>

			<p>
				The most distant ancestor of the horse, Eohippus, was a cat-size animal that lived
				in forests 50 million years ago. Its descendants learned to feed on grass, but life
				in the open plains required larger size and speed to escape predators. The Thistle
				Creek horse, a male, would have been of modern size.
			</p>

			<p>
				Bruce MacFadden, an expert on fossil horses at the University of Florida, said the
				Danish team’s findings were reasonable in light of the fossil data. “It’s always
				wonderful when the fossil and molecular evidence coincide,” he said. But the influence
				of climate on horse demography is more complicated than the genomic data suggests,
				he said.
			</p>

			<p>
				The horse’s genome consists of 2.7 billion units of DNA. The DNA extracted from the
				Thistle Creek bone was fragmented into minute pieces about 25 to 75 DNA units in
				length. The Danish team calculates that pieces only 25 units long could survive for
				a million years, which they see as the theoretical limit for reconstructing ancient
				genomes.
