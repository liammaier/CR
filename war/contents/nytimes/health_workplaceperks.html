				Within my first week of working at a start-up, I acquired a gut. The reason was obvious:
				there was free food everywhere, it was delicious and I was nervous. Within five days I
				was heaving my stomach around like a kettle bell and crossly preparing, and then ignoring,
				cups of green tea.

				It all started so innocently. On Monday, warm cookies from the Upper West Side bakery
				Levain appeared in the kitchen. Buttercream cupcakes followed; apparently it was somebody’s
				birthday. (It is always somebody’s birthday.) At noon, employees gathered for a catered
				lunch of barbecue. Two hours later, a Pinkberry station rolled into the office with the
				full battery of toppings. I helped myself to an incapacitating dose. By 5 p.m. my dress
				had grown so tight around the middle that I had to unzip it to my coccyx and put a
				sweater on top just to breathe.
			</p>

			<p>
				And that was only the first day.
			</p>

			<p>
				My employer, the eyewear company Warby Parker, is not unusual. Small, high-growth tech
				companies have had a reputation for showering employees with lavish perks since the
				Silicon Valley bubble days. At Sun Microsystems, nursing were provided lounges for
				breast-feeding and an on-call “lactation consultant.” Cisco offered dry-cleaning
				services and popcorn. Pinball machines lined the hallways at Excite@Home.
			</p>

			<p>
				In his recent book, “Finding the Next Steve Jobs,” Nolan Bushnell, who founded Atari,
				recommends keeping toys in the office and allowing employees to nap on the
				clock — like Steve Jobs, who installed a futon beneath his desk.
			</p>

			<p>
				But New York’s tight market for skilled start-up labor has produced an even more
				sophisticated arms race.
			</p>

			<p>
				Take Squarespace, a Web publishing platform founded in 2004. On a recent
				Friday afternoon, employees sat serenely in the firm’s SoHo offices, the room silent
				except for rapid keyboard clicks. A slim woman wearing her hair in a topknot ferried
				dishes of shrimp gumbo and quinoa salad to a buffet; midday meals for Squarespace
				employees are prepared four days a week. (On the fifth day, they order out.) Gluten-free
				and vegetarian options are offered at each meal, as well as a fridge stocked with
				Tecate and Red Bull.
			</p>

			<p>
				On another morning at Tumblr headquarters on East 21st Street, a young man in
				futuristic shoes poured a glass of seltzer (it’s on tap) and sat down to breakfast:
				a plate piled with bacon. His co-workers nibbled at pastries, sipped high-end coffee
				and rooted around the fridge for their favorite flavor of Chobani yogurt. Greek yogurt,
				in fact, is one of the most popular start-up perks.
			</p>

			<p>
				“It’s eaten almost as quickly as it’s stocked,” said Cyrus Massoumi, 36, the founder
				and chief executive of ZocDoc, an online medical scheduling service. “I’m partial
				to Siggi’s Skyr, myself.”
			</p>

			<p>
				The free lunches and self-replenishing pantries of New York’s start-ups can occasionally
				bring to mind Cockaigne, the mythical medieval land where cakes grew on trees, meat
				pies rained from the sky and fish leaped from rivers to roast themselves and fly
				directly into waiting mouths. In one 13th-century French epic poem, “Huon de Bordeaux,”
				a paradisiacal river restores health and youth to all who drink from it. Today’s
				version? Coconut water.
			</p>

			<p>
				“For a treat-loving man such as myself, the office is a great environment,” said
				Martin Mulkeen, 29, a senior editor at Birchbox on East 28th Street.
			</p>

			<p>
				And let’s not forget the basics.
			</p>

			<p>
				“We have cold-brewed coffee at all times,” said Dan Logan, 28, the director of product
				marketing at Bitly in the Union Square area. Bitly workers (“Bitizens,” they call
				themselves) may also prepare beverages from the office’s Jura Impressa X9 Platinum,
				which pumps out cappuccinos at the touch of a button. (The machines start at $6,495.)
			</p>

			<p>
				“I was not a coffee drinker at all before I started StyleUp,” said Kendall Herbst, 29,
				a former Lucky magazine editor who co-founded the personal styling service. “Now it’s
				my lifeblood.”
			</p>

			<p>
				As many employees noted, New Yorkers are picky about their coffee, so office managers
				can forget about throwing a can of Folgers in the freezer and calling it a day.
				Perhaps the most popular provider is Stumptown Coffee Roasters from Portland, Ore.,
				whose Hair Bender blend can be found in many start-up pantries. As Mr. Logan put it,
				“You got to have good brew.”
			</p>

			<p>
				That includes alcohol. Artsy, an art appreciation platform, hosts a weekly happy hour
				in its Chinatown office that features 360-degree views of Manhattan (and beer on tap).
				Birchbox keeps its fridge supplied with Champagne for celebrations, and Tumblr also
				offers beer on tap (this week: an aromatic, malty I.P.A.). But when it comes to spirits,
				the lifestyle publication Thrillist reigns supreme, with two fully stocked bars and a
				rotating schedule of liquor tastings.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Whiskey, tequila: it’s always available,” said Devon Giddon, 27, the company’s
				director of communications. “Not to mention the kegerator.”
			</p>

			<p>
				The what? “It’s a keg in the fridge, so it’s always cold.”
			</p>

			<p>
				With start-ups subsidizing round-the-clock snacking and drinking, it’s easy to pack
				on weight. Rather than institute a dress code of elastic-waist pants, many companies
				offer free gym memberships, yoga classes and group SoulCycle outings to keep employees
				in fighting form. Birchbox has a mini-gym inside the office.
			</p>

			<p>
				“We have random hula-hooping sessions,” said Melissa Enbar, 29, the company’s director
				of recruiting. Multitaskers at Squarespace can choose to work from ErgoErgo chairs
				if they wish; shaped like giant fusilli pasta tubes, the seats supposedly engage core
				muscles while users write JavaScript and tweet.
			</p>

			<p>
				For those immune to the temptations of a Michael Phelps-style caloric regimen, other
				distractions are available. Spotify hands out free concert tickets and treats employees
				to performances from artists like Sheryl Crow, while Chartbeat workers play with office
				puppies in the puppytorium (also known as the back room). Birchbox employees can sign
				up to get manicures and haircuts in the office.
			</p>

			<p>
				“We try to facilitate an environment where employees feel really comfortable,” said
				Andrew Burke, 28, the head of talent development at Squarespace. “It pays off in
				terms of the work that is done and the results that happen.”
			</p>

			<p>
				But the escalation of perks can lead to sticky situations.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Once you set a precedent, it can be difficult to take things away,” said Mr. Burke,
				citing an iTunes account that allowed Squarespace employees to guest-D.J. the office
				music. Trouble arose when employees began to play “random stuff that wasn’t necessarily
				on par with how others were vibing.” The account was disabled.
			</p>

			<p>
				Unlimited vacation, which most of the start-ups in this article offer, also provides
				a clear opportunity to overindulge, though no employer seemed to have a problem with
				it — perhaps because daily life in their offices has much in common with an all-inclusive
				resort.
			</p>

			<p>
				And not surprisingly, employees are quick to defend their perks.
			</p>

			<p>
				“I don’t think having beer at the office is decadent,” said Mr. Mulkeen of Birchbox.
				Other employees made a convincing case that they spend more time at work thanks to
				the ambient luxuries.
			</p>

			<p>
				And some even display “perks envy.”
			</p>

			<p>
				“I’ve heard that one company has Juice Press juices in their communal fridge that
				you can take,” said Ms. Herbst of StyleUp, her voice wistful. “That’s quite a nice
				perk that I would love to have.” (A 17-ounce bottle of the company’s juice runs about $9.)
			</p>

			<p>
				Mr. Burke of Squarespace said: “I heard that one place pays for someone to clean
				your apartment. The more we see companies escalating with perks, the more we’ll
				hear about things that seem outrageous.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Mr. Bushnell of Atari, a veteran of the start-up world, was asked where he draws
				the line between “productive perk” and “wanton decadence.” His answer: Well, he doesn’t.
			</p>

			<p>
				“I’ve often felt that it is somehow wrong to have an engineer spend any time at all
				scrubbing his own toilet,” he said. “It sounds elitist, but these people are highly
				important to the economy and to the company. Offering maid service to them as a
				perk makes total sense.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Katia Beauchamp, 30, a Birchbox founder, had a different perspective.
			</p>

			<p>
				“I often think of the analogy between this and being a parent,” she said.
				“You want to give people every opportunity, but sometimes you make a decision
				to hold back because you know it’s better not to have a spoiled child.”
			</p>

			<p>
				For me, the lesson quickly sank in. As much as I enjoyed vacuuming up cookies,
				I couldn’t afford to outgrow all of my new work clothes. Since then, I’ve kept
				a lid on my treat consumption. If I fail, a company-subsidized gym membershipawaits me.
