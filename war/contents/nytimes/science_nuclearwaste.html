				WASHINGTON — As more nuclear reactors across the country are closed, the problem of what
				to do with their waste is becoming more urgent, government officials and private experts
				said at a conference here this week.
			</p>

			<p>
				To address the problem, a bipartisan group of four senators introduced a bill on Thursday
				that would provide for temporary, centralized storage, even as House leaders remained focused
				on trying to revive plans for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository that the Obama
				administration has declared dead.
			</p>

			<p>
				Nuclear waste is accumulating in steel and concrete storage casks at reactor sites around
				the country. But the casks — sealed boxes of many tons — cannot be sent to any repository
				because they are not compatible, said Jeff Williams, director of the Energy Department’s
				Nuclear Fuel Storage and Transportation Planning Project.
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition, a growing number of the sites no longer have an operating reactor or the
				associated fuel-handling equipment, so they have no way to move the highly radioactive
				fuel to another storage package.
			</p>

			<p>
				Experts say the amount of orphaned nuclear waste is mounting. Nuclear utilities have
				announced the retirement of an additional four reactors so far this year, which leaves
				three more sites without an operating reactor. Before that development, the Energy
				Department counted nine such sites, with about 2,800 tons of fuel in 248 casks and was
				hoping to establish a pilot-scale interim storage plant for that fuel.
			</p>

			<p>
				Stored fuel requires guards and other continuing expenses, which are significant if there
				is no reactor nearby. Those expenses eventually fall on federal taxpayers because the
				Energy Department has defaulted on contracts it signed in the 1980s to begin accepting the
				wastes for burial in 1998. As a result, financial penalties the federal government must
				pay to the nuclear utilities for failing to dispose of the waste now amount to hundreds
				of millions a year.
			</p>

			<p>
				Even the concept of an interim site is facing problems — not least a law that bars the use
				of an interim site until construction has begun at Yucca.
			</p>

			<p>
				Selecting and opening a new site for permanent disposal would most likely take decades at
				least, so finding a place for storage in the meantime may strain the definition of “interim.”
				Solving the interim problem is in turn difficult if there is no long-term solution on the horizon.
			</p>

			<p>
				“We understand the idea that you can’t pick up fuel stranded in many locations to ultimately
				have it stranded in one location,” said Christopher Hansen, a senior policy adviser in the
				Energy Department’s Office of Nuclear Energy.
			</p>

			<p>
				A commission investigating storage alternatives recommended last year that the government
				find a willing host, which it called a “consent-based process.” The recommendation is in
				contrast to Congress’s choice of Yucca in 1987, over the objections of the host state, Nevada.
			</p>

			<p>
				But what exactly consent-based means is not clear. Mark Lombard, the director of spent
				fuel storage and transportation at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which would have
				to license a permanent repository or an interim storage site, said, “We’re pretty good
				at solving technical issues. It’s the consent-based process that’s a little bit squishy.”
			</p>

			<p>
				And some of the technical questions will take time, including development of rail cars
				that can safely hold the casks, experts said.
			</p>

			<p>
				The government has currently paid out about $2 billion in damages, and its liability is
				rising by hundreds of millions of dollars a year. If the government could establish an
				interim site, it could limit its penalties to about $21 billion, said Lake Barrett, a
				former Energy Department official.
			</p>

			<p>
				But that schedule is ambitious, according to participants in the conference, which was
				organized by a trade group, the United States Nuclear Infrastructure Council. How long
				the fuel can safely sit in the casks, either at the 120 or so locations where nuclear
				reactors have ever operated, or at a smaller number of centralized spots, is the subject
				of a separate proceeding at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
			</p>

			<p>
				The commission has long maintained that the fuel is safe there for decades, but some of
				it has already been stored for more than 30 years, and it seems certain to be stored
				there for decades more.
			</p>

			<p>
				Some of the younger fuel shows signs of degrading with age. The reason is that in the
				1990s, many of the reactors made a transition to fuel assemblies with a rich enough mix
				of uranium to run for up to six years, instead of the three years that had been standard.
				The new fuel, called “high burn-up fuel,” spent longer in the harsh environment of a
				reactor, and now shows signs of corrosion and cracking.
