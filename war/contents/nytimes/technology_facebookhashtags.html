			<p>
				Facebook has joined the hashtag revolution, introducing a tool on Wednesday
				that allows users to add the # symbol before a word to signify its topic.
				The topic would then be easily searchable by other users of the social network.
			</p>

			<p>
				Of course, anyone who has used the microblogging service Twitter is familiar
				with hashtags, which have long been used there to organize public conversations.
				Right now, for example, #manofsteel is a popular hashtag on Twitter because of
				the coming Superman movie. Search for that hashtag on Twitter and you can see
				the global conversation about the topic.
			</p>

			<p>
				Tumblr, Pinterest and other social networks also use hashtags, and Google
				announced last month that it was adding hashtags to its Google Plus service.
			</p>

			<p>
				In a blog post, Facebook said it, too, wanted to make it easier for its users
				to participate in a common conversation.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Every day, hundreds of millions of people use Facebook to share their thoughts
				on big moments happening all around them. Whether it’s talking about a favorite
				television show, cheering on a hometown sports team or engaging with friends
				during a breaking news event — people on Facebook connect with their friends
				about what’s taking place all over the world,” Greg Lindley, a Facebook product
				manager, wrote in the blog post. “To bring these conversations more to the
				forefront, we will be rolling out a series of features that surface some of the
				interesting discussions people are having about public events, people and topics.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Starting Wednesday, users can click on a hashtag in Facebook and see a feed of
				what other people and organizational users are saying about that event or topic.
			</p>

			<p>
				Facebook said users would also be able to click on hashtags that originated on
				other services, like Instagram, a photo-sharing service owned by Facebook that
				already uses the tool.
			</p>

			<p>
				The new hashtag service is immediately available to about 20 percent of Facebook
				users, with the rest getting it gradually over the coming weeks.
			</p>

			<p>
				The company said it would roll out additional features, including trending
				hashtags, in the near future.
