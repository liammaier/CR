				Fewer Hospitalizations for C.O.P.D. Patients

				You don’t see supermarket products emblazoned with ribbons to help support research
				on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Major corporations don’t sponsor walkathons
				for thousands of cheering supporters.
			</p>

			<p>
				This group of respiratory disorders, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis, is the
				third leading cause of death in the United States and accounts for a fifth of all
				hospitalizations among people over age 75 — yet we hear surprisingly little about it. Why is that?
			</p>

			<p>
				“C.O.P.D. has a stigma,” said Dr. Gulshan Sharma, director of pulmonary and critical
				care medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Because smoking
				accounts for most C.O.P.D. in this country, the prevailing public attitude is, “You did
				it to yourself,” he said. So the disease, which strikes older people more frequently,
				remains both underdiagnosed and undertreated.
			</p>

			<p>
				Yet the research Dr. Sharma and his colleagues recently published in The American
				Journal of Medicine documents considerable progress. “The number of hospitalizations
				has been reduced drastically,” he said. “This shows that care of patients with C.O.P.D.
				has improved.”
			</p>

			<p>
				C.O.P.D. comprises two illnesses: one, emphysema, destroys air sacs deep in the lungs;
				the other, chronic bronchitis, causes inflammation, congestion and scarring in the airways.
				People with C.O.P.D. — their breathing problems frequently compounded by other illnesses,
				including heart disease, diabetes and osteoporosis — are no strangers to hospitals.
				Exacerbations can land them there as often as two or three times a year.
			</p>

			<p>
				But the Texas team, analyzing a decade of Medicare data, looked at the experiences of more
				than 192,000 patients and found that from 1999 to 2008, hospitalizations declined 18 percent.
				The number of patients who’d had two or more acute exacerbations requiring hospitalization
				had dropped 23 percent.
			</p>

			<p>
				That’s not because fewer people have the disease. Eventually, reduced smoking may also reduce
				the prevalence of C.O.P.D., but that hasn’t happened yet; according to the Centers for
				Disease Control and Prevention, for about a decade the proportion of the population affected
				by the disease has hovered at about 4 percent of men and 6 percent of women, and the
				figures are much higher among older people. (Yes, there are more women with C.O.P.D. — and
				because as a group they began smoking more recently, the rates are likely to rise, at
				least for a while.)
			</p>

			<p>
				The researchers also found that the proportion of C.O.P.D. patients with more than three
				accompanying medical conditions grew substantially, which you’d expect to lead to more
				hospital admissions, not less. It hasn’t.
			</p>

			<p>
				On the contrary, for every 100 patients followed for a year, there were 131 hospitalizations
				in 1999. By 2008, there were 107. Given the more than 800,000 hospitalizations for C.O.P.D.
				each year, “these small numbers can translate into a very large impact,” Dr. Sharma said.
			</p>

			<p>
				The primary factor keeping people with C.O.P.D. out of hospitals is more effective
				treatment. “We have better medications now,” Dr. Sharma said, listing a host of examples
				like long-acting bronchodilators, inhaled steroids and combination drugs introduced in the
				past decade and being more widely used.
			</p>

			<p>
				“None of these can reverse the damage, but they help you breathe better and reduce your
				risk of exacerbation,” he said. “They improve your quality of life.” Redesigned devices,
				like inhalers, have become easier to use, especially for older patients with less dexterity.
			</p>

			<p>
				The reduced hospitalization rate probably also reflects improved treatments for the other
				diseases C.O.P.D. patients often have. “We’re managing their heart disease better,” for
				instance, Dr. Sharma said. He and his colleagues think that increased use of the flu
				vaccine and legislation that’s reduced exposure to secondhand smoke have probably helped,
				too, since either illness or smoke can lead to exacerbations. “A decade ago, two hours
				in a bar was like smoking a full pack,” he said.
			</p>

			<p>
				All of which means there’s now good reason to see if your or your parent’s constant
				coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath (especially when it accompanies physical activity)
				or frequent respiratory infections might be caused by C.O.P.D.; the diagnostic process
				includes breathing into an apparatus called a spirometer.
			</p>

			<p>
				Medical professionals who haven’t kept up with treatment advances may remain more pessimistic
				than necessary about this disease. A 2008 study of family physicians, nurse practitioners
				and physician assistants working in primary care, for example, found that many weren’t
				using appropriate medical guidelines and felt they lacked knowledge and training in C.O.P.D.
				Very few said they believed treatment would be useful in improving symptoms or reducing
				exacerbations, despite considerable published data showing it can.
			</p>

			<p>
				For years, Dr. Sharma said, “we had a nihilistic approach: ‘It’s a done deal; here’s an
				inhaler.’” Now, there’s more to offer.
			</p>

			<p>
				The single most important action C.O.P.D. patients can take to stay out of hospitals, of
				course, is to stop smoking. The single best way to avoid developing C.O.P.D. is not to start.
				It’s hard to argue with prevention strategies and smoking-cessation efforts; ultimately,
				fewer smokers will mean less C.O.P.D.
			</p>

			<p>
				But many older adults who already have C.O.P.D. can still feel better, be more active
				and spend less time in hospitals. This patient guide from the C.O.P.D. Foundation
				provides further details.
