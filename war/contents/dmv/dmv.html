				<h2><span>A License to Drive</span></h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">More than 3 million of us share Oregon’s streets and highways.</span> We ask
				that you always drive safely and courteously. Remember, <strong>driving is a
				privilege you earn, not a right</strong>. Be careful to drive in a way that allows
				you to keep that privilege.</p>

				<p>While driving a motor vehicle on highways or premises open to the public in
				Oregon, you must have either a valid driver license or instruction permit in your
				possession. You must get an Oregon driver license or instruction permit when
				you become a resident, even if your out-of-state license or instruction permit has
				not expired. When DMV issues an Oregon driver license or instruction permit,
				you must turn in any license or instruction permit you have from another state.</p>

				<p>If your Oregon driving privileges are suspended or revoked, you cannot
				drive in Oregon with a license or instruction permit from another state.</p>

				<p>Residents of other states who drive vehicles in Oregon must be at least
				16 years of age and have a valid out-of-state driver license or be at least
				15 years of age and have a valid out-of-state instruction permit. Out-ofstate
				instruction permit holders must abide by the same restrictions as
				persons with an Oregon instruction permit.</p>

				<p>If you are in the military on active duty, you do not need an Oregon
				license if you have a valid license from your home state. A spouse of
				someone in military service may also drive in Oregon with a valid license
				from another state.</p>

					<h4><span>Licenses, Permits, and Identification (ID) Cards</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Oregon issues several classes of driver permits, licenses, and endorsements.</span>
					Each class or endorsement defines what vehicles you may drive.</p>

					<h5>Class C Instruction Permit</h5>

					<p>You must be at least 15 years of age to apply for an instruction permit.
					This permit allows the operation of the same vehicles that a Class C
					license allows. A licensed driver who is at least 21 years old must be
					seated beside you in the vehicle. The supervising driver must have had a
					license for at least three years for the driving experience to count toward
					the 50 or 100 hour requirement to get a provisional license.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Class C instruction permits are valid for 24 months.</li>

						<li>If you are under 18 years of age, it is unlawful to operate a motor
						vehicle using a mobile communication device. This includes texting
						or talking on a cell phone, even with a hands-free accessory. If you are
						18 years of age or older, you may use a hands-free accessory.</li>

						<li>Read Section 6 carefully and be aware of how certain actions can
						affect your driving privilege.</li>

						<li>Be sure to check with any state in which you may be traveling to find
						out if your Oregon instruction permit allows you to drive in that state.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Class C License</h5>

					<p>A Class C license allows a person who is at least 18 years old to drive:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>A car or any single vehicle (mopeds, passenger cars, vans, and
						pickups) with a loaded weight and gross vehicle weight rating
						(GVWR) of not more than 26,000 pounds that is exempt from
						commercial driver license (CDL) or motorcycle requirements.</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">2</span></div>

					<ul>
						<li>A recreational vehicle—including motor homes and campers—for
						personal use.</li>

						<li>A fire or emergency vehicle.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>You may also tow:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>A single vehicle which has a loaded weight and GVWR of 10,000
						pounds or less.</li>

						<li>A travel trailer for personal use.</li>

						<li>A trailer with loaded weight or GVWR over 10,000 pounds, if the
						combined weight and GVWR of the towing vehicle and trailer is not
						more than 26,000 pounds.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Before DMV can issue any other class of license, permit, or endorsement,
					you must first qualify for a Class C license.</p>

					<h5>Class C Provisional License (under 18 years of age)</h5>

					<p>DMV issues a Class C Provisional license to persons 16-17 years of age.
					A Class C Provisional license allows the operation of the same vehicles
					that a Class C license allows. Provisional drivers are closely monitored
					through DMV’s Driver Improvement Program to promote safe driving
					practices. Read <em>Section 6</em> carefully and be aware of how certain actions
					can affect your provisional driving privilege. These include tobacco
					offenses; possession, use or abuse of alcohol; possession, manufacture,
					delivery or use of any controlled substance; not attending school; and
					traffic convictions.</p>

					<p>To apply for a provisional license you must:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Have had an instruction permit from Oregon, another state, or the
						District of Columbia for <strong>at least six months.</strong> If you do not have an
						Oregon instruction permit, you must take the Driver Knowledge Test.
						Holding an out-of-state instruction permit for a period of less than six
						months does not “count” toward the six month timeframe.</li>

						<li>
							Certify and have your parent or legal guardian certify that you
							have either:

							<ul>
								<li>50 hours of supervised driving experience and have taken an
								ODOT-approved traffic safety education course. (Visit <span class="url">www.oregon.
								gov/ODOT/TS/de_providers.shtml</span> for a list of providers.) You must
								present the original course completion certificate when you apply
								for your provisional license. <strong>OR</strong></li>

								<li>100 hours of supervised driving experience.</li>
							</ul>

							For your driving experience to meet this requirement, it must have
							been supervised by someone at least 21 years of age who had a valid
							license for at least three years.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">3</span></div>

					<ul>
						<li>Pass a Safe Driving Practices Test. There is no fee for this test.</li>

						<li>Pass a behind-the-wheel drive test.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If you are 16-17 years of age and already have a valid driver license
					from another state, you are not required to have an instruction permit for
					six months or certify supervised driving experience. DMV may also waive
					the behind-the-wheel drive test. You must pass the Driver Knowledge Test
					and the Safe Driving Practices Test. The provisional license restrictions
					still apply once you receive your provisional license.</p>

					<h5>Restrictions on a Class C Provisional License</h5>

					<p>It is unlawful to operate a motor vehicle while using a mobile
					communication device if you are under 18 years of age. This includes
					texting or talking on a cell phone, even with a hands-free accessory.</p>

					<p><strong>For the first six months</strong> you cannot drive with a passenger under 20
					years of age who is not a member of your immediate family AND you
					cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. unless for a reason in the list
					of exceptions.</p>

					<p><strong>For the second six months</strong> you cannot drive with more than three
					passengers under 20 years of age who are not members of your immediate
					family AND you cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. unless for a
					reason in the list of exceptions.</p>

					<p><strong>Exceptions</strong> to driving between midnight and 5 a.m. for the first year:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Driving between home and work.</li>

						<li>Driving between home and a school event for which no other
						transportation is available.</li>
						
						<li>Driving for employment purposes.</li>

						<li>When accompanied by a licensed driver who is at least 25 years
						of age.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The passenger restrictions do not apply while you are driving with an
					instructor as part of a certified traffic safety education course, or with a
					parent or stepparent who has valid driving privileges.</p>

					<h5>Other Privileges</h5>

					<p>DMV also issues the following driving privileges:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Mopeds</strong> - You can operate a moped with a Class C license or a
						moped-restricted license. (See the <span class="italic"><em>Oregon Motorcycle &amp; Moped
						Manual</em></span>.) If a bike is more than 50cc <strong>or</strong> if it goes over 30 mph on
						level ground, it is not considered a moped and you need a motorcycle
						endorsement to operate it.</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">4</span></div>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Motorcycles</strong> - To operate a motorcycle, you must have a motorcycle
						instruction permit or a driver license with a motorcycle endorsement.
						(See the <span class="italic"><em>Oregon Motorcycle &amp; Moped Manual</em></span>.)</li>

						<li><strong>Commercial driver licenses (CDL)</strong> - To operate certain trucks and
						buses, or vehicles carrying passengers or hazardous materials, you
						must have a commercial driver license. (See the <span class="italic"><em>Oregon Commercial
						Motor Vehicle Manual</em></span> for more information.)</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Identification (ID) Cards</h5>

					<p>DMV issues non-driver ID cards to Oregon residents who do not have
					a valid driver license or instruction permit and who need some form
					of photo identifi cation. You must show DMV the same identifi cation
					documents to obtain an ID card as are required to obtain a driver license.
					You cannot have both a driver license or permit and an Oregon ID card.</p>

					<p>If you are convicted of giving a false statement on your application,
					using a false or fictitious name or document, or giving a false address or

					purpose of identification and photo comparison.</p>

					<p>Hats and glasses, including prescription glasses, are not allowed.
					You may not wear face paint, stickers, or other temporary substances
					or materials that cover or distort all or part of the face or contact lenses
					that significantly change the appearance of the eye. If you are unhappy
					with your photo and would like it re-taken, you must pay the fee for a
					replacement card.</p>

					<h5>Interim Card</h5>

					<p>If you meet all the requirements to obtain an Oregon driver license,
					permit or identifi cation card, you will be issued an interim card at the
					DMV office. Your permanent license, permit or ID card will be produced

					paying the replacement fee prior to issuance.</p>

					<span class="url">www.OregonDMV.com</span>, or at a DMV office. DMV will mail you an
					address change sticker to affix to your license, permit, or identification
					card. There is no charge for an address change sticker.</p>

					<p>To receive a replacement license, permit or identification card with your
					new address on it, you must bring proof of the address change (<em>Page 8</em>)
					and pay the replacement fee at your local DMV office.</p>

					<h5>Organ, Eye, and Tissue Donation</h5>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/1.png">
					</figure>

					<p>Anyone at least 15 years of age, regardless of health or age, can
					sign up on the organ, eye, and tissue donor registry. DMV will
					add a “D” restriction code to your license, permit or identification
					card. The ability to be a donor is not determined until the time
					of death and the criteria for donation can change due to medical</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">10</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">research. Everyone who registers should inform their family of the decision to
					be a donor.</p>

					<p>You may also register online or obtain more information about organ,
					eye, and tissue donation for transplant at <span class="url">www.donatelifenw.org</span> or
					calling (800) 452-1369.</p>

					<h5>Voter Registration</h5>

					<p>If you are 17 years of age or older, you may register or re-register
					to vote when you are issued a driver license, instruction permit or
					identification card. DMV will forward your voter registration application
					to the registrar in your county of residence.</p>

					<h5>Veteran Designation</h5>

					<p>If you are a veteran you may request that DMV add a veteran
					designation on your license, permit, or identifi cation card. You must
					present a Certification of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (Form
					DD214) or a Correction to DD214 (Form DD215) as proof that you are
					a veteran. If you were discharged before 1950, a separation document
					issued by a branch or department of the US Armed Services is acceptable.
					You may add the veteran designation for no additional cost anytime
					you apply for an original, renewal or replacement license, permit, or
					identifi cation card.</p>

					<h4><span>Examinations</span></h4>

					<p></p>

					<div class="blue">
						<p><strong><span class="first-sentence">For an original license of any type or upgrade to a different
						class of license, DMV will test your:</span></strong></p>

						<ul class="centered">
							<li>Vision</li>

							<li>Driving Knowledge</li>

							<li>Driving Skill</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<p>If you are 16 or 17 years old, you must also pass a Safe Driving
					Practices Test.</p>

					<p>You must <strong>pay test fees prior to testing</strong>. (See <em>Fee Schedule, Page 2</em>.) If
					you fail a knowledge or drive test, you will need to <strong>pay the test fee each
					time you repeat the test</strong>. Every time you test, DMV requires you to present
					<strong>proof of legal presence, full legal name, date of birth, and address</strong>.</p>

					<p>DMV may waive the drive test for new residents surrendering a valid outof-
					state license or an out-of-state license that is expired less than one year.
					If you no longer have the out-of-state license in your possession, you may be
					required to obtain a letter from your previous state verifying the expiration date.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">11</span></div>

					<p>You may take the vision, knowledge, and drive tests at most regular
					DMV offices. For more information, call the <em>phone numbers listed on
					Page 117</em>, or visit <span class="url">www.OregonDMV.com</span>.</p>

					<h5>Vision</h5>

					<p>DMV will check your eyesight to confirm you can see well enough to
					drive safely. DMV conducts tests for visual acuity and field of vision. If
					you take the test while wearing glasses or contacts, your license will carry
					a restriction for corrective lenses.</p>

					<p>If the test shows your eyesight does not meet the licensing standard, DMV
					may issue you a license for daylight driving only. DMV may also require an
					examination with a vision care specialist before you are issued a license.</p>

					<h5>Driver Knowledge Test</h5>

					<p>This test asks questions about road signs, traffic laws, and other
					information a driver needs to know. This manual includes all the
					information necessary to pass this test. It is a multiple-choice test with
					35 questions. To receive a passing test score of 80%, you must correctly
					answer 28 questions. For a sample knowledge test, see <em>Page 115</em>, or visit
					<span class="url">www.OregonDMV.com</span>.</p>

					<h5>Safe Driving Practices Test</h5>

					<p>This is an additional knowledge test required for a person under 18
					years of age applying for a driver license. It checks your knowledge of
					safe driving practices gained through driving experience and information
					covered in this manual. Before taking this test, it is a good idea for you to
					read the manual again.</p>

					<h5>Testing Rules and Guidelines</h5>

					<ul>
						<li>All knowledge tests are closed book. With permission, you may use a
						foreign language translation dictionary.</li>

						<li>Only testers are allowed in the testing area, except for authorized
						interpreters.</li>

						<li>Knowledge tests are given on a touch-screen monitor. The test is
						available in several languages, with or without audio assistance. If
						you require a special accommodation to take a knowledge test, please
						contact your local office.</li>

						<li>During the test there is no talking, cell phone use, operation of any
						electronic devices, writing or note taking, or cheating of any kind.
						If you do not follow the testing rules and guidelines or it is determined
						that you are cheating, your test will be stopped immediately. You will
						not be allowed to test again for 90 days.</li>

						<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">12</span></div>

						<li>Do not allow someone else to take a licensing test for you. Your
						driving privileges will be suspended if DMV determines someone else
						has taken a test for you.</li>

						<li>Check office hours prior to taking your test. Although you do not need
						an appointment to take a knowledge test, unless you need special
						accommodation, you must be assisted at the counter at least one hour
						before closing time. Note that smaller offices may close during lunch
						hours. See www.OregonDMV.com for more information on office
						testing hours.</li>

						<li>Each test has a mandatory waiting period between failures. If you fail
						your Driver Knowledge Test or Safe Driving Practices Test, you must
						wait at least one day before trying again. If you fail your test four or
						more times, however, you must wait at least 28 days before taking the
						test again.</li>

					<h5>Drive Test</h5>

					<p>During the behind-the-wheel drive test, you demonstrate your driving
					skills and how you obey traffic rules, highway signs, and signals. The test
					includes turning, signaling, backing, lane changes, speed control, road
					courtesy, and general driving ability.</p>

					<p>DMV requires you to show evidence of insurance for your vehicle
					before the drive test. Proof of insurance includes a valid insurance card
					with specifi c information for the vehicle you will use on the drive test.
					If you do not have the necessary insurance information, you will have to
					reschedule the drive test.</p>

					<p>The driver examiner will inspect your vehicle to make sure the vehicle
					equipment needed during the drive test is safe, legal, and in working order.
					Requirements include a working passenger door handle, a reasonably
					clean front passenger seat, and valid license plates or a temporary permit,
					along with equipment required for legal operation of the vehicle. (See
					<em>Mandatory Vehicle Equipment, Page 109</em>.) If your vehicle is not properly
					registered or does not pass the vehicle inspection, you will have to
					reschedule the drive test.</p>

					<h5>Tips for Taking the Drive Test</h5>

					<ul>
						<li>Only you and the examiner can be in the vehicle during a drive test.
						Interpreters, family, friends, or pets cannot be in the vehicle during
						a test.</li>

						<li>Remove weapons from your vehicle before taking a drive test. Store
						them at home or at some other safe location.</li>

						<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">13</span></div>

						<li>Turn off any electronic devices in your vehicle, such as the radio,
						cell phone or pagers. Remove objects from the dashboard and
						rearview mirror.</li>

						<li>If you are under 18 years of age and you fail the drive test, you must
						wait 28 days after each failure before retaking the test. You must have
						a valid Oregon instruction permit for 28 days between tests. If you fail
						a fifth test, you must wait one year before taking another test.</li>

						<li>If you are 18 years of age or older and you fail the drive test, you must
						wait seven days before taking your next test. If you fail the second
						time, you must wait 14 days before the third test. Subsequent tests
						may be taken 28 days apart. If you fail your fifth test, you must wait
						one year before taking another test.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Drive tests are conducted by <strong>appointment only</strong>. To schedule a drive
					test appointment, call the <em>phone numbers listed on Page 117</em>, or on DMV’s
					website at <span class="url">www.OregonDMV.com.</span></p>

				and Markings</span></h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">Oregon’s traffic signs, signals, and pavement markings follow the
				national standards. </span>Signs often use easily recognized symbols or pictures
				rather than words. You must obey all official highway signs, signals, and
				markings unless you see a police officer or road worker redirecting traffic.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="5" data-name="Signs">

					<h4><span>Signs</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Each type of sign has a special color to help you recognize the sign at
					a glance.</span> The colors are illustrated below on the left. In addition to color,
					the shape of a traffic sign helps you identify the sign and what you must
					do to obey it. In poor visibility conditions, such as heavy fog, you may be
					able to make out only the shape of a sign. It is important for drivers to get
					to know both the colors and shapes of highway signs.</p>

					<h5>Intersection Traffic Control Signs</h5>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Intersections may be dangerous.</span> Traffic control devices, such as signs
					that prohibit certain actions or movements, are shown on this page.
					These signs help increase safety by controlling the flow of traffic through
					intersections. Remember: At intersections, red means stop, yield, do not
					enter, or wrong way.</p>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatleft" src="/contents/dmv/images/4.png">
					</figure>

					<p class="not-indented"><strong>STOP—OCTAGON:</strong> This eight-sided sign means just
					what it says—STOP. You must stop at a marked stop line
					or crosswalk on the pavement, if there is one. If there is no
					stop line or crosswalk, stop before the unmarked crossing
					area. If there are no pedestrians, pull forward until you can
					see traffic coming from your left and right, but before you
					get into the intersection. You may cautiously drive through
					the intersection or enter the intersection and make your
					turn, after looking both ways for oncoming traffic. Yield
					right of way to traffic in the intersection or close enough to
					be a hazard (including people walking or riding bikes).<br/>
					<strong>YIELD—TRIANGLE:</strong> This sign means you should reduce
					speed and, if needed for safety, stop the same as you
					would for a stop sign. Yield right of way to traffic in the
					intersection or close enough to be an immediate hazard.<br/>
					<strong>DO NOT ENTER—SQUARE:</strong> This sign warns you
					not to enter a road or freeway in the wrong direction.
					You will see this sign if you are going the wrong way.
					</p>

					<p>The signs below prohibit certain actions. When you see a sign with a red
					circle and a red slash mark across a black arrow or symbol, it means do
					not do whatever is shown.</p>

					<h5>Ramp Meters</h5>

					<p>Ramp meters are placed on freeway on-ramps to help prevent

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">25</span></div>

					<p>When operating, ramp meters alternate between red and green lights
					every few seconds. Only one vehicle can pass each time the green light
					comes on. For multi-lane on-ramps, each lane has a ramp meter.</p>

					<p>Ramp meters will appear dark when not in use. Do not stop at a dark
					ramp meter.</p>

					<h5>Pedestrian Signals - Don’t Walk/Walk</h5>

					street. If a DON’T WALK or “raised hand” signal
					(orange) is flashing or showing, pedestrians may not start
					to cross the intersection. Pedestrians in the crosswalk
					when the DON’T WALK or “raised hand” signal
					begins flashing should continue crossing the street.</p>

					<h4>Pavement Markings</h4>

					<p>Markings painted on the road tell you where to drive, inform you about

					<h4><span>Railroad Crossings</span></h4>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/81.png">
					</figure>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Railroad crossings have pavement
					markings that include a large “X”,
					the letters “RR”, a no-passing zone,
					and a stop line.</span> Railroad crossing
					collisions should not happen. When
					they do, it usually means drivers
					are not paying attention to signs,
					pavement markings, and other
					warning devices. Trains move much
					faster than they appear. Do not try
					to cross the tracks unless you can
					get in the clear on the other side
					well ahead of the train’s arrival at
					the crossing. Do not try to beat the
					train. Never stop on tracks, even for a moment.</p>

					<p>Signs and signals are used to mark railroad crossings. When you see
					one of them, slow down, look, and listen because you may have to stop.
					Remember: Trains are large and heavy and cannot stop quickly.<br/>
					Stop before railroad tracks when:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Flashing red lights are activated.</li>

						<li>A crossing gate is lowered.</li>

						<li>A flagger signals you to stop.</li>

						<li>A train is clearly visible or is so close to the crossing that it would be
						hazardous for you to try to cross.</li>

						<li>A stop sign is posted, even if you do not see a train coming.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>When required to stop, do so at the clearly marked stop line. Some
					collisions occur when drivers stop on or too close to a track. If there is no
					stop line, stop at least 15 feet from the nearest rail.</p>

					<p>After stopping, do not start across the tracks until you are sure you can
					do so safely. At crossings with multiple tracks, look carefully to see if a
					second train is coming on another track from either direction. <strong>It is illegal
					to go through, around or under a crossing gate or barrier that is down
					or is being opened or closed.</strong></p>

					<p>Some vehicles, such as school buses or trucks carrying hazardous
					materials, must stop at all railroad crossings. If you are following this type
					of vehicle, be prepared to stop.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">31</span></div>

					<h5>Light Rail Trains and Streetcars</h5>

					<p>Light rail trains and streetcars run on tracks in the roadway. Overhead
					wires usually power them. You need to exercise caution when crossing
					rail tracks or sharing the road with a light rail train or streetcar. These
					vehicles cannot stop quickly or swerve out of the way of cars.</p>

					<p>When driving on a street shared by light rail or streetcars:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Wait for the left turn signal—a train or streetcar may be coming from
						behind on your left.</li>

						<li>Check for trains before changing lanes. Do not swerve suddenly into a
						lane with tracks to pass another vehicle.</li>

						<li>When parking on roadways with light rail or streetcars, park behind
						the line separating the parking area from the track to avoid being
						struck by a train or streetcar. If no stripe is present, allow at least 4
						feet outside of the rails.</li>

						<li>Use caution when passing a stopped train or streetcar and watch for
						pedestrians. Passengers unloading from the train may cross in front of
						the train into your lane of traffic.</li>

						<li>Pay special attention to bicyclists traveling along or crossing rail
						tracks. Rails can cause bicyclists to lose control.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>When approaching rail tracks at an intersection:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Slow down and look both ways before crossing.</li>

						<li><strong>Never</strong> stop on the track or within the area protected by the crossing
						gates. Stay behind road markings.</li>

						<li>Do not go around crossing gates when they are down.</li>

						<li>For non-gated rail crossings, stay well behind the stop lines marked
						on the pavement.</li>

						<li><strong>Never</strong> turn in front of an approaching light rail train or streetcar.
						Do not try to beat the train through the intersection. Trains cannot
						stop quickly.</li>

				<h1>Section 3</h1>

				<h2><span>Rules of the Road</span></h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">The rules of the road are those laws and practices that provide safe
				and efficient movement of vehicles.</span> They include such things as starting,
				signaling, turning, overtaking, passing, and stopping.</p>

				<p>Even on a short trip, you may be faced with dangerous driving
				conditions. Statistics show that half of all vehicle crashes occur within 25
				miles of home.</p>

				<p>The following will help you avoid the need to make quick decisions and
				sudden moves:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Learn the traffic rules and follow them.</li>

					<li>Be prepared to yield to others to avoid a crash.</li>

					<li>Always watch carefully for advance warning and information signs.</li>

					<li>Be a courteous driver. Be predictable; communicate clearly and early.
					Anticipate other vehicles’ movements and plan ahead.</li>
				</ul>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="20" data-name="Speed Regulations">

					<h4><span>Speed Regulations</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">The speed at which you drive determines how much time you have to
					act or react and how long it takes to stop.</span> The higher the speed you are
					traveling, the less time you have to spot hazards, judge the speed of other
					traffic, and react to conditions.</p>

					<h5>The Basic Rule Law</h5>

					<p>The basic rule states <strong>you must drive at a speed that is reasonable and
					cautious for existing conditions</strong>. The basic rule applies on all streets and
					highways at all times.</p>

					<p>To obey the basic rule, you need to think about your speed in relation
					to other traffic, pedestrians, bicycles, the surface and width of the road,
					hazards at intersections, weather, visibility, and any other conditions that
					could affect safety. Use posted speed signs to help you determine what is a
					reasonable and prudent speed for present conditions.</p>

					<p>If you drive at a speed that is unsafe for existing conditions in any area,
					at any time, even if you are driving slower than the speed limit, you are
					violating the basic rule. The basic rule does not allow you to drive over
					the speed limit.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">33</span></div>

					<h5>Speed Limits</h5>

					<p>In addition to the basic rule, Oregon has maximum speed limits inside
					city limits, school zones, and on interstates. A speed limit is the maximum
					speed considered safe for the area under ideal driving conditions. You may
					be cited if you drive at a speed above those limits. Fines are higher and
					your driving privileges may be suspended if you drive more than 30 miles
					per hour over the speed limit or 100 miles per hour or greater.</p>

					<p>The following speeds are set in law for the specifi ed areas, whether
					posted or not. They apply unless some other speed is posted. Speed signs
					may or may not have the word LIMIT on them.</p>

					<table>
						<tr>
							<td><img src="/contents/dmv/images/82.png"></td>

					</table>

					<h5>Photo Radar</h5>

					<p>Some cities and work zones in Oregon use photo radar for speed
					enforcement. The photo radar equipment takes a photo of the vehicle and
					driver if the vehicle is exceeding speed laws.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">34</span></div>

					<h5>Slow Drivers</h5>

					<p>When you drive slower than the normal speed of traffic, you must use
					the right lane or drive as closely as possible to the right curb or edge of
					the road, unless you are getting ready to make a left turn.</p>

					<p>Watch for congestion behind you if you drive slower than the designated
					speed. Pull off the road at the first area where it is safe to turn out and let
					the traffic behind you pass. The overtaking driver must obey the speed law.</p>

					<h5>Racing</h5>

					<p>It is illegal to race with another vehicle or to organize a speed race
					event. Racing is not necessarily driving at high speeds. It can be any
					contest between two or more drivers and vehicles, such as an acceleration
					contest or the making of a speed record.</p>

					<h5>Following Distances</h5>

					<p>To share the road safely, always maintain a safe distance from the
					vehicle in front of you. You will have a better view of the road to
					anticipate problems and you will give yourself an emergency “out.” Rear-end
					crashes are very common. The number one cause is drivers <strong>following
					too closely</strong>. They are unable to stop before hitting a vehicle ahead that
					suddenly stops.</p>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/87.png">
					</figure>

					<p>A safe following distance is defined as 2-4
					seconds. For speeds greater than 30 mph, a safe
					following distance should be 4 seconds or more.
					Generally, it takes three seconds to stop or take
					other action to avoid a collision, leaving only
					one second for the driver to make a decision.
					Use the following tips to determine if you are
					following too closely:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Watch for when the rear of the vehicle ahead
						passes a sign, pole, or any other stationary
						point. Count the seconds it takes you to reach
						the same spot by counting: “one-thousandone,
						one-thousand-two,” etc.</li>

						<li>You are following too closely if you pass
						the mark before you finish counting <strong>at least</strong>
						two seconds.</li>

						<li>If so, drop back, and then count again at
						another spot to check your new following
						distance. Repeat until you are no closer than
						two seconds behind the other vehicle.</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">35</span></div>

					<p>When stopping behind another vehicle at a stop light, make sure you
					leave enough space to see where the rear tires of the vehicle in front meet
					the road. When the light turns green, return to a safe following distance.</p>

					<p>There are situations, such as those listed below, when you need even
					more space between your vehicle and the one in front of you. In all of
					these situations, you should increase your following distance:</p>

					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>On wet or slippery roads</strong>. You
									need more distance to stop your
									vehicle on wet or slippery roads.</li>

									<li><strong>When the driver behind you
									wants to pass</strong>. Slow down to
									allow room in front of your
									vehicle for the passing vehicle
									to complete the pass sooner and
									more safely.</li>

									<li><strong>When following bicycles or
									motorcycles</strong>. You need extra room
									in case the rider loses control of
									the bicycle or motorcycle.</li>

									<li><strong>When following drivers who
									cannot see you</strong>. The drivers of
									trucks, buses, vans, or vehicles
									pulling campers or trailers may
									not be able to see you when you
									are directly behind them. These
									large vehicles also block your
									view of the road ahead. More
									room allows you to see ahead.</li>

									<li><strong>When approaching railroad
									crossings.</strong> Leave extra room
									between you and vehicles required
									to stop at railroad crossings,
									including school buses or vehicles
									carrying hazardous materials.</li>
								</ul>
							</td>

							<td>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>When you have a heavy load
									or are pulling a trailer</strong>. The
									extra weight increases your
									stopping distance.</li>

									<li><strong>When it is hard for you to see</strong>.
									In bad weather or darkness,
									increase your following distance
									to make up for decreased visibility.</li>

									<li><strong>When following emergency
									vehicles</strong>. Some police vehicles,
									ambulances, and fire trucks
									need more room to operate. You
									should not follow closer than 500
									feet behind a fire truck or other
									emergency vehicle.</li>

									<li><strong>When stopped on a hill</strong>. The
									vehicle ahead may roll back when
									it starts to move.</li>

									<li><strong>When you are learning to
									drive</strong>. As a new driver, you
									need extra room when learning
									driving skills, such as steering,
									turning, lane changes, and reading
									traffic signs or signals. Leave
									extra room between you and the
									vehicle ahead. The extra room
									provides you time to make critical
									decisions as you learn.</li>
								</ul>
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>

					<h5>Stopping Distances</h5>

					<p>You need to know how long it takes to stop any vehicle you drive. Stopping
					distance can depend on road and weather conditions, the speed you are
					traveling, the weight of your vehicle, your reaction time, and the braking
					ability of your vehicle.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">36</span></div>

					<p>Large trucks and combinations of vehicles cannot stop as quickly as
					passenger vehicles. Give them more stopping room than a car.</p>

					<p>The braking ability of vehicles can vary widely due to type and condition
					of the pavement surface, the type and condition of tires and brakes, and
					other factors. Study the table below. It takes longer to stop than you think.</p>

					vehicle is moving in traffic, use your turn signal at least 100 feet before
					the turn or lane change. When you are parked at a curb and about to reenter
					traffic, use a signal long enough to alert oncoming traffic that you
					are moving into a traffic lane. You also should signal before you slow
					down or stop. Gently put your foot on the brake. Your stop lights will alert
					drivers behind you and signal them that you are slowing down.</p>

					<p>Use hand-and-arm signals (shown above) only in daylight when you
					need them and can clearly see people and vehicles at a distance of 1,000
					feet. At night or when visibility is poor, you must use turn signal lights,
					not hand-and-arm signals. Hand-and-arm signals are not enough any time
					you are driving a wide or long vehicle.</p>

					<h5>Turns</h5>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/90.png">
					</figure>

					<p>The general rule for turning is to turn from the
					closest lane in the direction you are traveling
					to the <strong>closest lane in the direction you want
					to go</strong>. Avoid changing lanes while turning.
					Rules for turning apply at all locations, such as
					driveways and alleys, not just at intersections.
					Turn smoothly and at a lower speed for safety.
					The diagram on the right illustrates the lanes to
					use when making left and right turns.</p>

					<h5>Right Turns</h5>

					<p>Well ahead of the turning point, check for traffic behind and beside you.
					Turn on your right turn signal at least 100 feet before the turn and before
					you need to brake. Get as close as is practical to the right curb or edge of
					the road without interfering with pedestrians or bicyclists. A bicycle lane
					is considered the edge of the roadway. Do not move into a bicycle lane
					in preparation for a right hand turn. Just before entering the intersection,
					look to the left, front, and right for oncoming traffic and cross traffic that
					may also be turning. Always check for bicycles in your blind spot on</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">38</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">your right before turning, especially ones you have just passed. Be alert
					for bicyclists who may ride up on the right side of your vehicle while
					you are preparing to make the right turn. You must yield to bicyclists in a
					bicycle lane or on a sidewalk before you turn across the lane or sidewalk.
					Pay special attention to the crosswalk on your right. Check and stop for
					pedestrians. Do not swing wide before or while turning.</p>

					<h5>Left Turns</h5>

					<p>When preparing to make a left turn, keep your wheels pointed straight ahead.
					Do not turn your wheels to the left until you actually begin to make the turn.
					If your vehicle is struck from behind while you are waiting to turn and your
					front wheels are turned left, your vehicle will be forced into oncoming traffic.</p>

					<p>Well ahead of the turning point, check for traffic behind or beside you.
					Turn on your left turn signal at least 100 feet before the turn and before
					you need to brake.</p>

					<p>On a two-way road, approach the turn with your vehicle in the lane just to
					the right of the center line. Just before entering the intersection, look to the
					left, front, and right for cross traffic on the intersecting street and oncoming
					traffic that may also be turning. Be especially alert for bicycles because
					they are harder to see than most other vehicles. Pay special attention to the
					crosswalk on your left. Check and stop for pedestrians before crossing the
					oncoming travel lanes. Begin the turn when you enter the intersection. Turn
					just before the imaginary center point in the intersection. Drive <strong>just to the
					right</strong> of the center line of the street you are entering. This avoids conflict
					with other traffic making either right or left turns.</p>

					<p>If a lane is signed or marked for making left turns, do not make this turn
					from any other lane. Do not travel in a two-way, special left turn lane to
					access a left turn only lane at an intersection.</p>

					<p>In some areas, you may make turns from more than one lane. Signs and
					pavement markings will tell you if this is allowed. Signs may also prohibit
					turns at some locations.</p>

					<h4><span>Roundabouts</span></h4>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/96.png">
					</figure>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Roundabouts, rotaries, and traffic circles are all terms used
					for circular intersections with a center island.</span> traffic moves
					in one direction, counterclockwise (to the right), around
					the center island. A warning sign with arrows in a circle
					pattern indicate a roundabout or other circular intersection
					is ahead. traffic entering a roundabout must yield to those
					already in the circle. However, rotaries and other circles may
					have stop signs. Drivers must pay attention and obey the signs.</p>

					<p>The following steps will help you travel safely through a roundabout.</p>

					<p><span class="italic">Approach</span> - Slow down to the posted speed as you approach the
					roundabout. Look for exit destination signs to help you determine where
					your exit is located on the roundabout.</p>

					<p>Watch for bicyclists. Near the entrance of the roundabout, bicycles will
					either exit from the bike lane onto the sidewalk or merge into traffic.</p>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/97.png">
					</figure>

					<p>Next, you will approach
					the crosswalk. Stop for any
					pedestrians that are using
					or beginning to use the
					crosswalk in your lane.</p>

					<p><span class="italic">Enter</span> - Upon reaching
					the roundabout, you must
					yield to traffic inside the
					roundabout as well as
					those vehicles exiting.
					Wait for a gap and merge
					into traffic. Be prepared to
					stop if necessary.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">41</span></div>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/98.png">
					</figure>

					<p><span class="italic">Proceed</span> - Once inside the
					roundabout, move around the circle
					counterclockwise until you reach
					your exit.</p>

					<p>Allow bicycles that have merged
					into traffic the full travel lane.
					Do not pass a bicyclist within
					the roundabout. They should be
					moving at nearly the same speed as
					other vehicles.</p>

					<p><span class="italic">Exit</span> - Always indicate your
					intent to exit using your right turn
					signal. Exit carefully. Watch for
					pedestrians in the crosswalk and be
					prepared to stop.</p>

					<h5>Multi-lane Roundabouts</h5>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/99.png">
					</figure>

					<p>Roundabouts may have one or more lanes.
					Here are a few additional tips to help you safely
					negotiate a multi-lane roundabout.</p>

					<p><span class="italic">Lane Choice</span> - Drivers must make the
					appropriate lane choice based on their destination
					before entering the roundabout. Pay close attention
					to exit destination signs and lane use signs, along
					with pavement markings, prior to
					entering the roundabout. Enter the
					roundabout using the appropriate
					lane for your exit.</p>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/100.png">
					</figure>

					<p>Maintain your lane position until
					you exit. Avoid lane changes while
					inside the roundabout if possible.</p>

					<p><span class="italic">Do Not Pass</span> - Do not attempt
					to overtake or pass any vehicles,
					especially large trucks and trailers
					within the roundabout. Trucks
					may need to straddle both lanes
					to negotiate the roundabout. It is
					illegal to pass or drive beside a
					truck within the roundabout.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">42</span></div>

					<p><span class="italic">Signal</span> - Remember to indicate your intended exit by using your right
					turn signal. Watch for pedestrians as you exit the roundabout.</p>

					<h5>Emergency Vehicles in Roundabouts</h5>

					<p>Do not enter a roundabout when emergency vehicles are approaching.
					Pull over to the right. Allow other vehicles to clear the intersection so the
					emergency vehicles can negotiate the roundabout. Never stop while inside
					the roundabout. Instead, move through and exit the roundabout. Once out
					of the roundabout, pull over to the right shoulder and allow the emergency
					vehicle to pass.</p>

				</section>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="24" data-name="Yielding Right of Way">

					<h4><span>Yielding Right of Way</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">There will be many times when you need to yield or slow down so
					another vehicle can proceed safely.</span> Yielding simply means you must slow
					down or, if necessary, stop your vehicle to allow another vehicle or a
					pedestrian to continue safely.</p>

					<p>The right of way law does not give anyone the right of way; it only says
					who must yield. Stop signs, yield signs, and traffic signals control traffic at
					busy intersections. They tell drivers who may go without stopping or who
					must stop and yield right of way to other drivers, bicyclists, or pedestrians.</p>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/101.png">
					</figure>

					<p>At an intersection where there
					are no signs or signals, you must
					look and yield the right of way to
					any vehicle in the intersection or
					approaching from your right at the
					same time.</p>

					<p>The diagram on the right
					illustrates a right of way situation.
					The car yields to the truck if the car
					is going straight ahead. If the car
					turns left, it yields to both the truck
					and the bicyclist. The truck yields
					to the bicyclist.</p>

					<p>Here are some important rules and guidelines about right of way. Study
					them carefully:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Stop before you enter or cross a road from an alley, private road,
						driveway or other place not controlled by signal lights or yield signs.
						Stop at the point nearest the roadway you are entering. Yield to
						approaching vehicles.</li>

						<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">43</span></div>

						<li>If you must cross a sidewalk, such as when entering or leaving an
						alley or driveway, stop <strong>before</strong> reaching the sidewalk and yield to
						pedestrians and bicyclists.</li>

						<li>When you make a left turn at an intersection or into an alley, private
						road, driveway, or any other place, you must yield the right of way to
						oncoming traffic until it is safe to turn.</li>

						<li>You must stop for pedestrians crossing the roadway at any marked or
						unmarked crosswalk. (Review <em>Pedestrians, Page 81</em>.)</li>

						<li>At school crossings, you must stop when students enter the crosswalk
						from either side of the street or if a patrol guard signals you to do so.
						Remain stopped until the students clear the crosswalk.</li>

						<li>When you approach a roundabout, yield to vehicles traveling within
						the circulating road. Within a roundabout, yield to vehicles turning in
						front of you from the inside lane (if any) to exit the roundabout.</li>

						<li>When you use an acceleration or merging lane to enter a freeway or
						other highway, you must give the right of way to vehicles already on
						the freeway or road.</li>

						<li>If you are the driver on a road that ends at a “T” intersection with no
						signs or signals, you must yield to the driver on the through road.</li>

						<li>At any intersection with stop signs in all four directions, it is common
						courtesy to allow the driver who stops first to go first. If in doubt,
						yield to the driver on your right. To avoid the risk of a crash, never
						insist on the right of way.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Blocking Traffic</h5>

					<p>Before you start through an intersection, crosswalk, or railroad grade
					crossing, be sure there is room on the other side for your vehicle. Even
					if you have a green light, do not start across an intersection if it causes
					your vehicle to stop in the intersection and block other traffic or a
					pedestrian crosswalk.</p>

				</section>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="25" data-name="Overtaking and Passing">

					<h4><span>Overtaking and Passing</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Passing another vehicle is a normal part of driving, but it can be very
					dangerous.</span> Before you start to pass, be sure you have enough room
					to complete the maneuver. If you have to cut back into your lane too
					soon, you risk sideswiping the vehicle you are passing. If you do not get
					back into your lane soon enough, you risk a head-on collision with an
					oncoming vehicle.</p>

					<p>When overtaking and passing another vehicle on a two-lane road, you
					should pass only to the left of the vehicle. Your pass may not begin before</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">44</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">the start of a designated passing zone and must be completed before your
					enter a no passing zone. Do not exceed the posted speed limit when passing;
					it is against the law to exceed posted speeds at any time.</p>

					<h5>How to Avoid Trouble When Passing:</h5>

					<ul>
						<li>Know the speed and acceleration ability of your vehicle, and be
						able to estimate the speed of the vehicle you are passing and of any
						oncoming traffic. As a rule, if you can recognize any movement of an
						oncoming vehicle, it is too close for you to risk a pass. When in doubt,
						stay in your lane.</li>

						<li>Watch ahead for intersections and do not pass while in an intersection.</li>

						<li>Stay well back of the vehicle you want to pass, especially large
						vehicles such as trucks and trailers, to give yourself a good view of
						the road ahead.</li>

						<li>Signal and check your rearview and sideview mirrors before you
						change lanes. Check your blind spot. Move to the left only when it is
						safe to do so.</li>

						<li>Complete your pass as soon as possible. When you can see the entire
						vehicle you passed in your rearview mirror, signal and return to
						your lane.</li>

						<li>Do not flash your bright lights to signal that you want to pass. It is
						illegal to flash your bright lights when following a vehicle closer than
						350 feet.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Passing on the Right</h5>

					<p>You may pass on the right <strong>only</strong> under one of the following conditions:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>The driver you are passing is making or has signaled for a left turn.
						There must be sufficient space to the right for you to pass without
						leaving the paved portion of the roadway or driving in a bicycle lane.
						The roadway in front of the vehicle you are passing must be clear.</li>

						<li>You are traveling on a roadway with two or more lanes traveling in
						the same direction and the vehicle you are passing is in the left lane.
						You may pass the vehicle using the right lane.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Use extra care when you pass on the right. Other drivers do not expect
					to be passed on the right.</p>

					<h5>No Passing</h5>

					<p>Do <strong>not</strong> cross the center line to pass when:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							You are in a no-passing zone, which is an area that is marked for no
							passing by a solid yellow line in your lane. A “DO NOT PASS” sign

							<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">45</span></div>

							may also be posted. Do not attempt to pass a vehicle if you cannot
							safely return to your lane before entering a no-passing zone.
						</li>

						<li>Your view of oncoming traffic is blocked because you are on a hill or
						in a curve.</li>

						<li>You are approaching an intersection, railroad crossing, or other area
						where your view of oncoming traffic is limited.</li>

						<li>You are at or in an intersection.</li>

						<li>You are at or on a railroad crossing.</li>

						<li>The vehicle ahead is stopped at a crosswalk to permit a pedestrian to cross.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>You may cross the center line in a no-passing zone only if the right
					side of the road is blocked or if you are turning left into or from an alley,
					driveway, intersection, or private road.</p>

					<figure>
						<img class="centered-img" src="/contents/dmv/images/102.png">
					</figure>

					<h5>Being Passed</h5>

					<p>When another driver tries to pass you, there are many chances for a
					collision. The driver may cut in too sharply, you may change lanes, or
					the driver may be forced back into your lane if the distance of oncoming
					traffic was misjudged.</p>

					<p>You can help the other driver pass you safely by checking oncoming
					traffic and adjusting your speed to let the driver move back into the right
					lane as soon as possible. When another driver starts to pass, stay to the</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">46</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">right and do not speed up until the other driver has passed. Do not use
					your hands or lights to signal other drivers when to pass. The law prohibits
					flashing any of your lights at drivers to let them know when to pass.</p>

				</section>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="26" data-name="Stopping, Standing, and Parking">

					<h4><span>Stopping, Standing, and Parking</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Except to avoid a conflict with other traffic; to obey a law, police
					officer, traffic sign or signal; or to momentarily allow traffic to pass
					before turning, you cannot stop, stand, or park your vehicle in any of
					these locations:</span></p>

					<ul>
						<li>Within an intersection.</li>

						<li>On the roadway side of any parked vehicle (double parking).</li>

						<li>On a sidewalk or crosswalk.</li>

						<li>On or within 7.5 feet of railroad tracks.</li>

						<li>In a bicycle lane or path.</li>

						<li>On a bridge or overpass or between separate roadways of a
						divided highway.</li>

						<li>In a tunnel.</li>

						<li>Any place where official signs or pavement markings prohibit it.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Other Locations</h5>

					<p>Additional areas where you cannot stand or park a vehicle (except
					momentarily to pick up or drop off a passenger) include, but are not
					limited to, these locations:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>In front of a public or private driveway.</li>

						<li>Within 10 feet of a fire hydrant.</li>

						<li>Within 15 feet of the entrance to a fire station on the same side of the

						hides the signal or traffic control device from view.</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="small-white"></div>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">47</span></div>

					<p>The rules about stopping, standing, and parking apply whether you are
					in your vehicle or away from it. These rules do not apply if your vehicle
					breaks down and you cannot get it out of the traffic lanes or there is not
					enough room off the road on the shoulder for you to stop or park.</p>

					<h5>Parking on Hills</h5>

					<p>Always set your parking brake. Leave your vehicle in gear if it has
					a manual transmission or in “park” for an automatic transmission. To
					prevent your vehicle from rolling downhill in case the brake fails while
					your vehicle is parked, turn your front wheels in the proper direction:</p>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/103.png">
					</figure>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Downhill Against a Curb</strong> -<br/>
						Turn your wheels toward
						the curb.</li>

						<li><strong>Uphill Against a Curb</strong> -<br/>
						Turn your wheels toward the
						travel lane.</li>

						<li><strong>No Curb</strong> - <br/>Turn your wheels
						toward the edge of the road.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Parallel Parking</h5>

					<p>Park in the direction vehicles
					are moving in the lane. Park
					parallel to and within 12 inches of
					the curb. If there is no curb, park
					as close as possible to the edge of
					the shoulder. Your wheels must be
					within the marked space.</p>

					<h5>Angle Parking</h5>

					<p>This type of parking is common
					in parking lots, in shopping
					centers, and on wide streets.
					When driving large vehicles avoid
					parking in spaces that obstruct
					traffic on the roadway. It could
					result in a citation or tow.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">48</span></div>

					<h5>Emergency Parking</h5>

					<p>If your vehicle has broken down and you have no choice, you may
					temporarily stop or park a vehicle in areas where it usually is not allowed,
					as long as the vehicle does not create a hazard. If you must stop or pull off
					the road, turn on your emergency flashers (hazard lights). This will help
					warn other drivers of the hazard.</p>

					<p>If necessary, you may park a vehicle on the shoulder of a highway if
					passing traffic has enough room to get by and if your vehicle can be seen
					from 200 feet in each direction. If it cannot be seen from 200 feet in each
					direction, you need to warn approaching traffic. This can be done with
					flaggers, flags, flares, signs, or signals placed at least 200 feet from your
					vehicle in each direction.</p>

					<h5>Unattended Vehicles</h5>

					<p>If you have an emergency and must leave your vehicle unattended on a
					highway, turn off the engine, lock the ignition, remove the key, firmly set
					the brakes, and turn on your hazard lights.</p>

					<p>If a police officer finds a vehicle parked in an area where it is not
					allowed or if it creates a hazard, the officer may have it moved or require
					you or a person in charge of the vehicle to move it.</p>

					<p>If you abandon a vehicle on the highway, police may have it removed
					and you will be responsible for towing and storage costs. You also may
					get a ticket for abandoning a vehicle.</p>

					<h5>Parking Spaces for
					Persons with Disabilities</h5>

					<p>Oregon issues special
					parking permits to
					persons with disabilities
					or groups that transport
					persons with disabilities.
					The internationally
					recognized disabled
					symbol indicates
					which parking spaces
					are reserved for vehicles displaying a disabled
					parking permit. Spaces may have the international
					symbol on the ground as well as a blue sign with
					the symbol placed at the front of each space.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">49</span></div>

					<p>It is illegal to do any of the following:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Park, even for a few minutes, in a space marked for the use of persons
						with disabilities, if you do not display the required valid disabled
						parking permit.</li>

						<li>Use a disabled parking permit when you are not entitled to the permit
						or use an invalid disabled parking permit. This includes using a permit
						that has been altered, photocopied, reproduced, mutilated, reported
						lost or stolen, or is not clearly readable.</li>

						<li>Park on the diagonal stripes next to a disabled person parking space,
						even if you hold a disabled parking permit. Persons with disabilities
						use this access area to enter and exit their vehicles.</li>

						<li>Block a disabled parking space or access area next to a disabled
						parking space with a vehicle or an object.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>For information on disabled person parking permits and how to apply,
					visit <span class="url">www.OregonDMV.com</span>.</p>

					<h5>Re-entering Traffic</h5>

					<p>When entering traffic from a standing, stopped, or parked position, turn
					on your signal, check your blind spots and mirrors, and yield to all other
					traffic on the road. Use hand and arm signals if other vehicles hide your
					turn signals. Be especially alert for bicycles and motorcycles, because
					they are narrower than most other vehicles and are harder to see.</p>

					<p>When entering a public road from a private road, driveway, or alley,
					you must stop for pedestrians. After stopping and looking for traffic at the
					roadway entrance, you must continue to yield to oncoming vehicles until
					there is enough time and space to enter the road safely.</p>

						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/106.png">
					</figure>

					<h5>Slow Moving Vehicle</h5>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Slow moving vehicles, such as farm equipment, must
					display this SLOW MOVING VEHICLE emblem when
					using a public highway.</span> The emblem is a standard type
					recognized nationwide, containing a reflective, red border
					and a fluorescent orange-red center. Be prepared to adjust
					your speed or position when you see this sign.</p>

					<p>Farming and construction machinery and equipment must display this
					sign except when guarded by a flagger or warning sign.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">50</span></div>

					<p>The sign must also be on the rear of golf cart type vehicles driven by
					persons with a disability. These types of vehicles may travel only on
					streets with a top designated speed of 25 miles per hour.</p>

					<p>Do not use this sign in any other way except on these vehicles
					and machinery.
					</p>

					<h5>Funeral Processions</h5>

					<p>Funeral processions are exempt from certain rules of the road. Vehicles
					in a funeral procession may enter an intersection without stopping, may
					get free passage through tollgates, and do not have to obey traffic control
					devices. Other vehicles must yield right of way.</p>

					<p>An escort vehicle must accompany a funeral procession, and the escort
					may exceed the maximum speed limit by 10 miles per hour. Escort and
					lead vehicles must have proper lighting.</p>

					<p>If you are not a member of the funeral procession, it is against the law
					for you to join the funeral procession or drive between vehicles in the
					funeral procession.</p>

					<h5>Tow Vehicles</h5>

					<p>Drivers of wreckers or tow vehicles who are hooking up to another
					vehicle must warn other drivers when they need to block the road. They
					do this by putting signs or signals (approved by the Oregon Department
					of Transportation) at a reasonable distance in each direction from the
					hookup area.</p>

					<p>Tow trucks must have a revolving, flashing, amber or red light for use
					when connecting to and moving a disabled vehicle.</p>

					<p>Tow vehicle drivers must remove glass or other material that could
					cause a hazard or injury if the material gets on the road while a wrecked
					or damaged vehicle is being moved. Check with DMV if you need more
					information about equipment for tow vehicles or tow truck permits.</p>

					<p>Depending upon what types of vehicles are being towed, some tow
					truck operators may have to obtain a commercial driver license. Refer to
					the <em><span class="italic">Oregon Commercial Motor Vehicle Manual</span></em> to find out if this applies
					to you.</p>

					<h5>Over-Length and Over-Width Loads</h5>

					<p>A red flag, at least 12 inches square, must be shown at the end of any
					load that extends 4 feet or more beyond the rear of the bed or body of a
					vehicle. A red light, visible for 500 feet to the rear and sides, must replace
					the red flag when limited visibility conditions exist.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">51</span></div>

					<p>Passenger vehicles must not carry loads that extend beyond the sides
					of the fenders on the left side. Loads may not extend more than 6 inches
					beyond the sides of the right fenders. Loads may not extend more than 4
					feet in front of any vehicle.</p>

					<h5>Pilot Vehicles</h5>

					<p>Pilot vehicles are specially marked vehicles that serve as a warning
					to other motorists. Pilot vehicles lead or follow a vehicle carrying an
					especially large load. If you see a pilot vehicle in oncoming traffic, reduce
					your speed and position your vehicle as far to the right as possible, while
					staying in your lane. Be very cautious if you attempt to pass a pilot
					vehicle or the vehicle that leads or follows. It’s a good idea to increase
					your following distance.</p>

					<h5>Animals</h5>

					<p>Animals on or near roadways can be unpredictable. Slow down and
					move away from animals as you pass them. Deer can be especially
					dangerous at night when they may freeze in the beam of your headlights.
					Watch for signs warning of animal crossings and be prepared to brake.</p>

					<p>If you hit and injure a domestic animal, stop and make an effort to
					check the extent of injury. Give reasonable attention to the animal.
					What you can do may vary with traffic hazards at the time or the
					animal’s demeanor. If possible, you should try to get the animal out of
					the way of traffic. Immediately report the injury to the animal’s owner.
					If you are unable to locate the owner you must then report the incident
					to local law enforcement.</p>

					<p>If an accident involves a large game animal, such as a deer or bear, and
					the animal remains on the scene, report the incident to the nearest law
					enforcement agency. Do not leave an injured animal to die.</p>

					<p>Use caution when you approach or pass someone who is riding, leading, or
					herding livestock on the highway. Drivers must yield right of way to livestock
					being driven on a roadway. Reduce your speed and pass cautiously.</p>

					<p>Stop your vehicle if a person riding on horseback or leading an animal
					raises a hand or it is obvious the animal is frightened, unless stopping would
					cause an accident. A raised hand means the animal is frightened. Do not use
					your horn or make other loud, sudden noises near the animal. If requested,
					turn off your engine until the animal or livestock is under control.</p>

					<h5>Littering</h5>

					<p>Do not throw any litter or other objects from a vehicle. Throwing
					away lighted or burning materials, such as cigarettes, is also against the</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">52</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">law. Conviction of these charges may result in a fine, jail sentence, and
					suspension of your driving privileges.</p>

					<p>It costs thousands of dollars to clean up litter each year. Cigarettes or
					other burning materials often times result in extensive damage to range
					and forest land. In addition, if you are caught and convicted of causing
					a fire through littering, you may be charged for the costs of putting out
					that fire.</p>

					<h5>Weapons</h5>

					<p>Never discharge a firearm, bow and arrow, or other weapon on or across
					a highway. Only police officers in the line of duty are exempt from this law.</p>

					<p>Any person 13–17 years of age who is convicted of intentionally
					possessing a firearm in a public building will be denied driving privileges,
					among other penalties.</p>

				<h1>Section 4</h1>

				<h2 class="tallerHeader"><span>Defensive<br/>Driving</span></h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">The key to being a defensive driver is to be alert for potentially
				dangerous situations.</span> Stay alert. Be aware of conditions around you at
				all times.</p>

				<p>Know the rules of the road and be watchful for those who do not follow
				them. Be willing to adjust your own driving to avoid a crash. Also, watch
				for pedestrians, bicyclists, and animals.</p>

				<p>Know how to adjust your driving to allow for problems with your
				vehicle, the type of road surface, poor weather, heavy traffic, poor
				lighting, and your own physical, mental, and emotional condition.</p>

				<p>Think about what is going to happen or what might happen as far ahead
				of the situation as possible. Never assume everything will be all right.</p>

				<p>You will be constantly making decisions every mile that you drive. There
				is a right way to make these decisions. It is known as <strong>defensive driving</strong>.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="29" data-name="Intersections">

					<h4><span>Intersections</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Never assume another driver will yield the right of way to you.</span> Be
					prepared to stop.</p>

					<p>Look both ways and to the front as you near an intersection. Look first
					to the left to make sure cross traffic is yielding right of way, then look
					right. As you enter the intersection, check again for unusual or unexpected
					actions to the front, left, and right. (Review <em>Driver Signals and Turns,
					Pages 38-40</em>, and <em>Yielding Right of Way, Pages 43-44</em>.)</p>

					<h5>Five Rules for Intersection Safety:</h5>

					<ol>
						<li>Know and obey the rules of the road on right of way, and obey traffic
						signs, signals, and pavement markings at intersections.</li>

						<li>Know your route and plan ahead. A turn from or into the wrong lane
						is dangerous. If you are in the wrong lane for a turn, go to the next
						intersection. It is safer to go around the block than it is to risk a crash
						due to a last-minute lane or direction change.</li>

						<li>Slow down for intersections and be alert for other drivers who may
						turn from or into the wrong lane.</li>

						<li>Use the position of your vehicle and signals to let other drivers and
						road users know what you plan to do.</li>

						<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">55</span></div>

						<li>Go with care. After you have stopped for a red light return to a safe
						following distance. (See <em>Page 35</em>.)</li>
					</ol>

					<h5>Signs and Signals</h5>

					<p>A defensive driver does not assume a stop sign or a traffic light will stop
					approaching traffic. Some drivers deliberately run stop signs or traffic
					lights. Others may be daydreaming and not see the sign or light.</p>

				</section>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="30" data-name="The Driver’s Role">

					<h4><span>The Driver’s Role</span></h4>

					<h5>Human Error</h5>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Human error is a leading cause of traffic crashes.</span></p>

					<p>Your mental and emotional state, as well as your physical condition,
					affects the way you drive a vehicle. Anger, worry, frustration, fatigue, and
					minor illnesses, such as a cold, are a few of the temporary conditions that
					can make you an unsafe driver.</p>

					<h5>Fatigue and Drowsy Driving</h5>

					<p>Fatigue may account for the fact that there are more crashes during
					evening rush hour traffic than during the comparable morning traffic rush.
					Drivers going home from work are tired, less alert, and slower to react
					than during the morning rush. Fatigue can also cause a driver to lose his or
					her temper or make a rash decision. In fact, most people are at some time
					unfit to drive because they are too tired and not alert to changing road and
					traffic conditions.</p>

					<p>Signs that you need to stop and rest include difficulty focusing or keeping
					your head up, frequent blinking or yawning, and drifting in your lane.</p>

					<p>Any loss of sleep can contribute to drowsy driving. Make sure you
					get plenty of sleep before leaving on a trip. Drive only during the hours
					you are normally awake. Never try to push through to your destination
					rather than find a safe place to stop and rest. Talk with your passenger to
					stay alert. Take turns driving to allow each driver to rest. Make sure both
					people in the front seats are awake. A driver who needs rest should go to
					the back seat, buckle up, and nap.</p>

					<h5>Alertness</h5>

					<p>Driving is not the time to solve business or family problems, plan a
					trip, daydream, or read something other than posted signs. You need to
					continually concentrate on what is happening in front of you, behind you,
					and on both sides of you.</p>

					<p>Safe, defensive drivers have an alert attitude. As an alert driver, you
					should scan around you and ahead of your vehicle. Note potential hazards,</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">56</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">such as the curve down the road, the slow-moving truck on the hill ahead,
					or the vehicle driving toward the street from a shopping center or side road.</p>

					<p>If you find yourself just going through the motions of driving, without
					really being aware of what you are doing or what is happening around
					you, it is time to quit for a rest or maybe for the day.</p>

					<h5>Hearing</h5>

					<p>Hearing plays a more important role than many drivers think. Sound can
					tell you a great deal about your vehicle and the traffic around you. A sudden
					change in the hum of tires on pavement can tell you the road surface or the
					tires have changed. The sound of your engine tells you if it is working right.
					Sound also can tell you when another vehicle may be in your blind spot or if
					a truck, ambulance, or fire engine is coming.</p>

					<h5>Vision</h5>

					<p>The importance of vision to driving is obvious. Good vision makes
					it possible for you to read signs in time to react to the message. The
					ability to judge the distance of oncoming vehicles is vital to such actions
					as passing. Peripheral vision—the ability to see objects and movement
					outside of your direct line of vision—helps you spot other vehicles,
					pedestrians, or bicycle riders coming toward you from a cross street.</p>

					<p>No one sees as well at night as during the day. Some people have trouble
					adjusting to the dark. Glare from the headlights of oncoming traffic affects
					some people more than others. When you combine headlight glare and wet
					pavement, drivers may have a real vision problem. Studies have shown that
					the human eye takes about seven seconds to recover from headlight glare.
					At 60 miles per hour, you travel about 616 feet in those seven seconds, and
					you actually may be driving blind during that time.</p>

					<p>As people age, they may have changes in vision that affect driving and
					other daily activities. It may be more difficult to change focus from distant
					to near objects and vice versa. Many people may need glasses or corrective
					lenses to see well and ensure safe driving.</p>

					<h5>General Health</h5>

					<p>Medical conditions, either temporary or long-term, can impact your
					ability to drive safely. If you are sick or recovering from an illness, ask
					yourself if you really feel up to the job of driving, especially on a long
					trip. In addition, some long term medical conditions may cause serious
					problems that impact safe driving. These problems may include loss of
					muscle control, decreased reaction time, confusion, or an unpredictable
					loss of consciousness. Talk to your doctor about the effect your condition
					may have on driving. Follow your doctor’s advice. DMV may require</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">57</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">you to get a medical clearance or pass DMV knowledge and drive tests to
					obtain a license or permit or to retain driving privileges.</p>

					<p>Some medications seriously impair driving ability by lowering your
					ability to make judgments, reducing vision, or slowing reactions. If
					you are taking medications, including such drugs as antihistamines,
					amphetamines, barbiturates, or tranquilizers, ask your doctor about the
					side effects and how they could impact your ability to drive safely.</p>

				</section>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="31" data-name="Driver’s View">

					<h4><span>Driver’s View</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">You must be able to see what is to the front, sides, and rear of your
					vehicle.</span> Do not load or equip your vehicle in any way that blocks what
					you can see or interferes with the control of your vehicle. Do not place
					stickers or other objects on your vehicle’s windows that can obscure your
					vision of the road.</p>

					<h5>Looking Ahead</h5>

					<p>Expert drivers try to scan the entire driving scene <strong>at least 12 seconds</strong>
					ahead. In the city, 12 seconds is about one block. On the highway you
					should scan 12 to 15 seconds ahead, which is about a quarter of a mile. It
					is especially important for drivers to look for trouble spots as far ahead as
					the eye can see. Doing this will help you avoid the need for last-minute
					moves. It also will be easier to keep your vehicle on a steady path, rather
					than weaving in its lane. Scanning does not mean looking at the middle
					of the road. It means taking in the entire scene, including the sides of the
					road. Scanning the road ahead and to the sides helps you see potential
					hazards ahead, vehicles that may enter your path, signs warning of a
					hazard ahead, or signs routing you to another street or road. It also helps
					keep you awake and alert.</p>

					<p>If a vehicle ahead stops suddenly, you are in trouble unless you are alert.
					Look for clues that a driver ahead may be going to stop, such as slowing
					down, a vehicle exiting a driveway ahead, a bicyclist on the road ahead, a
					child playing to the side of the road, turn signals blinking, or brake lights
					coming on. Do not rely on the turn signal of another driver; the driver
					may signal to turn right and then turn left, may not turn at all, or may turn
					without signaling.</p>

					<h5>Blind Spot</h5>

					<p>If you are changing lanes, preparing to pass another vehicle, or entering
					traffic, signal and check for passing traffic by first using your mirrors. Once
					the mirrors reveal safe conditions for the lane change, check your vehicle’s
					blind spot by glancing over your shoulder to the rear in the direction of the</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">58</span></div>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/109.png">
					</figure>

					<p>lane change. Be especially alert
					for bicycles and motorcycles as
					they are narrower than most other
					vehicles and can’t be easily seen.</p>

					<h5>Space Cushions</h5>

					<p>When a driver makes a mistake,
					other drivers need time to react.
					The only way you can be sure you
					have enough time to react is by
					leaving plenty of space between
					your vehicle and the vehicles around you. That space becomes a “space
					cushion.” It protects you from others. You should try to keep a cushion of
					space on all sides of you—ahead, to each side and behind.</p>

					<h5>Cushion Ahead</h5>

					<p>Rear-end crashes are more common than any other kind because many
					drivers follow too closely. For tips to help you determine if you are
					following too closely, refer to <em>Following Distances on Page 35</em>.</p>

					<h5>Side Cushion</h5>

					<p>A space cushion to the side will give you room to react defensively to
					sudden moves toward your lane by other vehicles. You should:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Avoid driving alongside other vehicles on multi-lane streets. Someone
						may crowd your lane or try to change lanes and pull into you. If
						possible, move ahead of the other vehicle or drop back a little.
						However, avoid driving in another driver’s blind spot.</li>

						<li>Keep as much space as you can between your vehicle and oncoming
						vehicles. If you can, stay out of the lane next to the center line. That
						way you will have more room to avoid an oncoming vehicle that
						suddenly swerves toward you. This is most important at intersections
						where another driver could turn left without signaling.</li>

						<li>Make room for vehicles entering freeways. If there is no one next to
						you, move over a lane. Help other drivers signaling for a lane change
						make the move safely by slowing down your vehicle or speeding up a
						little, if needed.</li>

						<li>At freeway exits, try not to drive alongside other vehicles. A driver on
						the freeway may pull off suddenly or a driver who has started to leave
						may swerve back onto the freeway.</li>

						<li>
							Keep a space between your vehicle and parked vehicles, especially
							on residential streets with on-street parking. A vehicle door may open

							<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">59</span></div>

							in your path or someone may step out of a vehicle or from between
							parked vehicles. For example, a child playing may run into the road
							chasing a ball.
						</li>

						<li>Keep plenty of room between your vehicle and bicyclists.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Cushion Behind</h5>

					<p>You can help the driver behind you keep a safe distance from your
					vehicle. Keep a steady speed, and signal in advance when you have to
					slow down or stop by tapping your brakes. Check your rearview mirrors
					about every five seconds to keep alert to what is happening behind you.</p>

					<p>If a vehicle behind you is following too closely and there is a right lane,
					move over to the right. If there is no right lane, or you cannot move over,
					begin to slowly reduce your speed as the approaching traffic provides the
					vehicle following you with a safe opening to pass. This may encourage
					the tailgater to go around you or to stop tailgating. Never brake hard to
					discourage a tailgater; you could get hit from behind.</p>

					<h5>Additional Cushion</h5>

					<p>In addition to cushions ahead, to the side, and behind, there are some
					drivers to whom you should give lots of room. For example, some drivers
					may not be able to see you and may get in your way without knowing you
					are there. Here are some situations where this could be a problem:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>At intersections or driveways. Buildings, trees, or other vehicles often
						block their view. (If you drive a large vehicle, you may help prevent a
						collision for someone else if you avoid parking near an intersection.)</li>

						<li>Vehicle windows that are fogged-over or covered with snow or ice.</li>

						<li>Distracted or confused drivers because they are looking for an address
						(such as a delivery van) or a certain route (such as someone with outof-
						state plates).</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Backing Up</h5>

					<p>Backing a vehicle is a small part of driving, but it is dangerous because
					you cannot see what is immediately behind you. Before you back up, you
					must be sure it is safe to do so and that it will not interfere with other traffic.
					It is a good idea to look behind the vehicle to make sure a child, pet, toy or
					other object is not in the way. Back slowly from a driveway into a street. Turn
					your head so you can look through the rear window. Do not depend on your
					mirrors. Be on the lookout for children, pedestrians, and bicyclists behind
					your vehicle or on the sidewalk. Back the vehicle no farther than needed.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">60</span></div>

				</section>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="32" data-name="Communicating With Other Drivers">

					<h4><span>Communicating With Other Drivers</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Collisions often happen because one driver does not see another driver.</span>
					If a driver does something the other driver does not expect, a collision can
					happen. It is important that you let other drivers know where you are and
					what you plan to do.</p>

					<p>You can let other drivers know where you are by:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Turning on your headlights.</li>

						<li>Using your horn.</li>

						<li>Putting your vehicle where it can be seen.</li>

						<li>Using your hazard lights when needed.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>You can let other drivers know what you plan to do by:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Signaling before changing direction or lanes.</li>

						<li>Using your brake lights to indicate you are slowing or stopping.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Opening Doors</h5>

					<p>When you open a vehicle door on either the street or curbside, you
					must first be sure it is safe to do so. The open door must not interfere with
					passing traffic, bicyclists, or pedestrians. Open the door only long enough
					to load or unload passengers. Drivers should make sure that passengers do
					this as well.</p>

					<h5>Using the Horn</h5>

					<p>People cannot see you unless they are looking your way. Your horn
					can get their attention. Use it when it will help prevent a collision, not to
					display temper or irritation. If there is no immediate danger, a light tap on
					the horn should be all you need. If there is real danger, do not be afraid to
					sound a sharp blast on your horn.</p>

					<h5>Road Rage and Aggressive Drivers</h5>

					<p>These high-risk drivers climb into a vehicle and may take out their
					frustrations on anybody at any time. Their frustration levels are high
					and their level of concern for other motorists is low. They may run stop
					signs and red lights, speed, tailgate, weave in and out of traffic, pass on
					the right, make improper and unsafe lane changes, make hand and facial
					gestures, scream, honk, and flash their lights at motorists who are in front
					of them. These are symptoms of something commonly called road rage.</p>

					<p>Don’t be an aggressive driver. If you are angry, you should not be
					driving. Give other drivers a break and share the road. The few extra
					seconds it takes to be courteous could save lives. Aggressive driving can
					lead to a citation from law enforcement or loss of your driving privileges.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">61</span></div>

					<p>If you encounter an aggressive driver, concentrate on your driving
					and make every attempt to get out of the way. Avoid eye contact, ignore
					gestures and name calling, and refuse to return them.</p>

				</section>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="33" data-name="Avoiding Collisions">

					<h4><span>Avoiding Collisions</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">When it looks like a collision may happen, many drivers panic and fail
					to react, or they do something that does not help reduce the chance of the
					collision.</span> Almost always, there is something you can do to avoid the crash
					or reduce the results of the crash. A driver has three tools that can be used
					to avoid collisions—stopping quickly, turning quickly, and speeding up.</p>

					<p><strong>Stopping quickly</strong> - Many vehicles have Antilock Braking Systems
					(ABS). Be sure to read your vehicle owner’s manual on how to use the
					ABS. ABS will allow you to stop without skidding. In general, if you need
					to stop quickly:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>With ABS - Press on the brake pedal as hard as you can and keep
						pressing on it. You may feel the brake pedal pulsing and hear the ABS
						system when it is working. Do not let up on the brake pedal. The ABS
						will only work with the brake pedal pushed down.</li>

						<li>Without ABS - You can cause the vehicle to skid if you brake too
						hard. Apply the brakes as hard as you can without locking them. If
						the brakes lock up, you will feel the vehicle start to skid. Ease off the
						brake pedal until the vehicle stops skidding and then reapply pressure.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>Turning quickly</strong> - In most cases, you can turn the vehicle quicker than
					you can stop it. If you see that you will not stop in time to avoid a collision,
					turn away from it. Make sure you have a good grip with both hands on the
					steering wheel. Once you have turned, be ready to keep the vehicle under
					control. Some drivers steer away from one collision only to end up in
					another. It is generally better to run off the road than to crash head-on into
					another vehicle. Always steer in the direction you want the vehicle to go.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>With ABS - You can turn your vehicle while braking without skidding.
						This is very helpful if you must suddenly turn and stop or slow down.</li>

						<li>Without ABS - If you do not have ABS, you must use a different
						procedure to turn quickly. Step on the brake pedal, but then let up and
						turn the steering wheel. Braking will slow the vehicle, putting more
						weight on the front tires, which allows for a quicker turn. Do not lock
						up the front wheels while braking or turn so sharply that the vehicle
						can only plow ahead.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>Speeding up</strong> - Sometimes it is best to speed up to avoid a collision.
					This may happen when another vehicle is about to hit you from the side or</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">62</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">from behind and there is room ahead of you to get out of danger. Be sure
					to slow down once the danger has passed.</p>

					<h5>Running Off the Road</h5>

					<p>You can get in serious trouble if one of your front wheels runs off the
					pavement. If you should run off the road because of inattention or be
					forced off the road by another driver, you need to know how to safely get
					back on the pavement. The wrong reaction could result in a head-on or
					run-off-the-road crash. Here’s what to do:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>Don’t panic and don’t brake hard.</li>

						<li>Grip the steering wheel firmly.</li>

						<li>Slowly reduce speed and keep your vehicle on a straight course.</li>

						<li>When you have slowed down and have steering control, check traffic
						behind you. When it is safe to do so, turn the front wheels enough to
						safely get you back on the road and into traffic. Do not oversteer, or
						you might go across the road into opposing traffic or shoot across the
						road into the opposite ditch.</li>
					</ol>

					<h5>Curves</h5>

					<p>Slow down before you enter a curve. Use the speed shown below a
					curve sign as a guide, if posted. Look through the curve to where you
					want to go and then check the lane position of approaching vehicles. Stay
					to the right of the center line and in the middle of your lane. Be alert for
					bicyclists, pedestrians, or slow-moving vehicles hidden around the curve.
					As you come out of a curve, increase your speed gradually.</p>

					<h5>Meeting a Vehicle</h5>

					<p>If an oncoming vehicle is drifting into your lane, pull to the right as far
					as possible, slow down, and warn the other driver with your horn or lights.
					Never pull into the opposing lane, because the oncoming driver may pull
					back sharply into that lane. In most cases, steering to the shoulder or ditch
					is safer than risking a two-vehicle head-on crash. A defensive driver is
					always aware of their surroundings and possible escape routes.</p>

					<h5>Protecting Yourself</h5>

					<p>You may not always be able to avoid a collision. If nothing works, try to
					keep the injury from being too serious.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>If you are hit from the rear, be ready to apply your brake so you
						will not be pushed into another vehicle. Brace yourself between the
						steering wheel and the back of the seat.</li>

						<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">63</span></div>

						<li>If you are hit from the side, brace yourself with the steering wheel to keep
						from being thrown against the inside of the vehicle. Get ready to steer
						quickly so that if you spin around, you can try to control the vehicle.</li>

						<li>If you are hit from the front and you are wearing a shoulder strap, use
						your arms and hands to protect your face. If you are not wearing a
						shoulder strap, throw yourself across the seat so you will not hit the
						steering column or windshield.</li>
					</ul>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="34" data-name="Freeway Driving">

					<h4><span>Freeway Driving</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Traffic on freeways usually moves more safely and efficiently because
					access is controlled.</span> There are few sharp curves, no railroad crossings, and
					no traffic lights. Even so, freeways require good driving skills and habits
					for you to safely get where you are going.</p>

					<h5>Plan Your Trip</h5>

					<p>Know your exact route—the entrances and exits you need to take.
					Check your gas gauge before getting on a freeway.</p>

					<h5>Entering a Freeway</h5>

					<p>In most driving situations, you slow down or stop before you enter a busy
					road, but when entering a freeway you do the opposite. Use the merging or
					acceleration lane to speed up and merge with fast-moving traffic already on
					the road. Try to reach freeway speed by the time you start merging.</p>

					<p>If you are entering a freeway from a merging lane, <strong>you must yield to
					traffic already on the freeway</strong>. Use your mirrors and check your blind
					spots before merging. If you are driving on the freeway, you are obligated
					to help merging traffic. Adjust your speed to permit a safe, smooth merge.</p>

					<p>Keep moving if at all possible. Stopping after beginning a merge might
					cause a slower, more dangerous move into faster traffic. Even slowing
					down as you approach an entrance can result in a rear end collision with a
					driver who expected you to pick up speed rather than slow down.</p>

					<p>If a freeway has an entry ramp with a red-and-green signal to regulate
					traffic entering the freeway, obey the signal. Stop and go with the light.
					Then, speed up in the acceleration lane to merge with traffic on the
					freeway. (Review <em>Ramp Meters, Pages 25-26</em>.)</p>

					<p>If you start to enter a freeway the wrong way, a DO NOT ENTER sign
					will warn you of your mistake. A second sign, WRONG WAY, is an added
					warning. Immediately pull off to the side of the freeway exit ramp and
					stop. Turn on your hazard lights to warn other vehicles of your presence.
					Cautiously back off the exit ramp. Do not make a U-turn. A driver exiting</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">64</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">the freeway at a high speed may not have enough time to react to your
					unexpected presence.</p>

					<h5>On Freeways</h5>

					<p>Speeds traveled on rural interstate freeways are higher than on other
					roads. There are fewer stop-and-go situations. Try to keep pace with
					traffic on the road, but do not be lured into exceeding the posted speed to
					stay with the flow of traffic.</p>

					<p>A slowpoke on a freeway can be as dangerous as a speeder. Remember, if
					you drive at a speed below the flow of traffic, you must use the right lane.</p>

					<p>Freeways often have several lanes in each direction. On these roads, you
					should leave the extreme left lane for faster traffic. If you drive at an even
					speed, you will have less need to change lanes. Remember, lane-hopping
					any time is dangerous, annoys other drivers, increases the risk of collision,
					and seldom saves time. Sudden bursts of speed also waste gasoline.</p>

					<p>If you are traveling in the left lane and someone comes up behind you at a
					faster speed, move one lane to your right. Do not tie up traffic in the left lane.</p>

					<p>There are times, especially in major cities, when freeways get jammed
					by heavy traffic or tie-ups caused by collisions during rush hour traffic. Be
					alert for any hint that traffic on the freeway ahead is not moving at a normal
					pace. If you spot a tie-up ahead that will cause you to slow down or stop,
					lightly tap your brake pedal several times to alert drivers behind you.</p>

					<h5>Vehicle Trouble</h5>

					<p>If you have vehicle trouble on a freeway, move to the right shoulder or
					emergency stopping area as soon as you can. Turn on your hazard lights
					to warn other traffic. If possible, it is better to stay in or near your vehicle
					on the side away from traffic. Walking along a freeway is dangerous. If
					you stay with your vehicle, a police patrol will stop to help you when one
					comes by if not on another call.</p>

					<h5>Leaving a Freeway</h5>

					<p>When you leave a freeway, signal your move well ahead of time.
					Maintain your speed until you move into the exit lane. As you leave the
					freeway and move onto the exit ramp, begin slowing to the slower speed
					limit posted on the ramp. Most exit ramps require much slower speeds
					than you have been driving on the freeway. Yellow speed signs posted at
					exits warn drivers of the speed needed to safely leave a freeway.</p>

					<p>Most freeway exits are numbered to help you quickly spot the exit you
					want to take. Exit numbers correspond to the nearest milepoint along
					the freeway. To reduce your chance of missing an exit, you should know</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">65</span></div>

					<p>the exit number in advance. If you do miss your exit, go to the next one.
					<strong>Never</strong> stop or back up on a freeway. You should stop on the shoulder only
					in an emergency and then get as far off the road as possible.</p>

					<h5>Restrictions</h5>

					<p>Bicyclists, parades, other non-motorized traffic, power-driven cycles,
					mopeds, or motor bicycles may be banned or restricted from using certain
					sections of freeways. Signs placed on the approach to and along the
					freeway may indicate the restrictions.</p>

					<h5>Expressways (Parkways or Beltways)</h5>

					<p>An expressway looks like a freeway in many ways, but there is one
					important difference—an expressway may have intersections with cross
					traffic and traffic lights. This difference means extra care is required.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="35" data-name="Night and Bad Weather Driving">

					<h4><span>Night and Bad Weather Driving</span></h4>

					<h5>Using Lights</h5>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Headlights must be turned on from sunset to sunrise.</span> Lights also must
					be on at any time conditions make it difficult to see people or vehicles
					1,000 feet ahead. By using your headlights on rainy, snowy, or foggy
					days, you will help other drivers see you and give yourself an extra safety
					margin. Headlights turned on during daylight hours will make your
					vehicle more visible to oncoming vehicles and pedestrians. Use headlights
					when driving at dusk. Even if you can see clearly, headlights help other
					drivers see you.</p>

					<p>Do not drive a vehicle with only the parking lights on when driving at
					night or in bad weather. The small size of parking lights may cause other
					drivers to think your vehicle is farther away than it is. Using parking lights
					alone when there is limited visibility is not only unsafe, it is against the
					law. The law requires a vehicle stopped or parked on a road or shoulder to
					have parking lights on when limited visibility conditions exist.</p>

					<p>It also is illegal to have auxiliary lights, such as driving or fog lights, in
					excess of 300 candlepower, on at times when you are required to dim your
					headlights. These very bright lights make it difficult for oncoming drivers
					to see.</p>

					<h5>Dimming Headlights</h5>

					<p>When your vehicle’s high beam headlights are on, you must dim or
					lower the beam when an oncoming vehicle is within 500 feet. You also
					must turn off any auxiliary lights.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">66</span></div>

					<p>Dim the headlight beam when you are following another vehicle within
					350 feet. Dimming headlights when following other vehicles is a practical
					safety step. Headlight glare in a rearview mirror can blind another driver.</p>

					<h5>Night Hazards</h5>

					<p>At night, your response to hazards is slowed because you cannot see what
					is beyond your headlights. You can reduce danger if you adjust your seeing
					and driving habits accordingly. Although there may be more crashes and
					heavier traffic during the day, the chances of a <strong>serious or fatal</strong> crash are
					much greater at night, especially late at night. Drivers who do not adjust to
					diminished light conditions are part of the night safety problem.</p>

					<p>Fatigue or drowsiness is especially dangerous when driving at night.
					If you are too tired or sleepy, you are less able to react and less aware of
					changing road and traffic conditions. You could even fall asleep. Be sure
					you are alert and rested before and during nighttime travel.</p>

					<p>Be especially alert for pedestrians and bicyclists at night or during
					dusk. Pedestrians wearing dark-colored clothing are especially difficult
					to see. Pedestrians may not realize how long it takes to stop a vehicle
					even at low speeds.</p>

					<p>At night or during dusk, bicycles may not be highly visible. Be
					especially alert for bicycles and motor-assisted scooters coming from
					side streets.</p>

					<h5>Reduce Speed at Night</h5>

					<p>Slow down after sunset. You need the extra reaction time that slower
					speeds allow. Well-adjusted headlights light about 350 feet of dark road.
					If you drive faster than about 60 miles per hour, you are actually driving
					blind—unable to see far enough ahead to be able to react to a hazardous
					condition before you hit it.</p>

					<p>Here are other safe driving suggestions for night driving:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Look slightly to the right of oncoming lights and watch the road edge
						or fog line. This will help guard against headlight glare.</li>

						<li>Check your headlights, taillights, and turn signal lights often to make
						sure they are working and that the lenses are clean.</li>

						<li>Be very careful when passing at dusk. If an oncoming vehicle does
						not have its headlights on, you may not see it until it is too late.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Fog-Dust-Smoke</h5>

					<p>If you drive into fog, dust, smoke, or any area of reduced visibility,
					reduce your speed. Use headlights on low beam so the light will be on the</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">67</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">road where you need it. Light from high beams will reflect back, causing
					glare and making it more  difficult to see ahead.</p>

					<p>Sometimes fog, dust, or smoke is in patches. Slow down before you
					enter a patch, and be prepared to pull over and stop. There may be a
					vehicle ahead of you, hidden in the fog, dust, or smoke that has slowed
					down or stopped because its driver could not see, or because of a collision
					ahead. If you choose to pull off the road, pull completely off the road as
					far as you can to the right and stop. Use your hazard lights. Chain reaction
					collisions, especially on freeways, often take place in fog, dust, or smoke.</p>

					<h5>Bad Weather</h5>

					<p>Drivers often have to adjust to poor driving conditions caused by weather.
					Bad weather calls for slower speeds. You should follow other vehicles at
					a greater distance. Rain, snow, and ice impair your ability to see ahead
					and increase the braking distance required to stop your vehicle. In these
					conditions, apply the brakes sooner and more gently than usual. Even
					summer showers cause slippery roads when rain mixes with oil and dirt.</p>

					<p>Increase your visibility and let other motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists
					see you; when your windshield wipers are on, also turn on your headlights.
					Do not use cruise control in wet, icy, or snowy weather.</p>

					<p>Vehicle tires sometimes hydroplane (skim or fl oat) over a wet road
					surface, leaving the vehicle without any road contact. When hydroplaning
					occurs, there is a loss of traction needed to safely steer and brake.
					Stopping distances may triple, and steering control can be reduced or lost.
					Speed and low tire inflation are the two biggest causes of hydroplaning.
					How soon hydroplaning begins depends on speed, tire inflation, water
					depth (even two-tenths of an inch), road surface, and tire tread.</p>

					<p>If you drive through water deep enough to soak the brake drums and
					linings, gently apply the brakes. If they get wet, they may not respond.
					Dry the brakes by driving slowly and gently applying the brakes until they
					begin to work. It is better to find this out before you need to brake for a
					curve, intersection, or a pedestrian.</p>

					<h5>Cruise Control</h5>

					<p>When driving conditions do not permit maintaining a constant speed, it
					is dangerous to use cruise control. Examples include heavy traffic; road
					surfaces that are slick due to rain, ice or snow; standing water; and curvy
					or hilly roads. Turn off the cruise control under any of these conditions.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">68</span></div>

					<h5>Snow and Ice</h5>

					<p>Drive at slower speeds on snow and ice. Be defensive. Leave more
					room between your vehicle and the one ahead. Keep windows clear of
					snow, ice, and fog.</p>

					<p>Here are a few other ideas to help you drive safely on snow and ice:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Keep a light, steady foot on the gas pedal. When your vehicle begins
						to move, too much power may cause the vehicle not to move at all or
						to start forward with its rear-end skidding to the right or left.</li>

						<li>Make turns at a reduced, steady speed to avoid a skid.</li>

						<li>Get the “feel” of the road away from traffic when you start driving.
						Try your brakes lightly so you will know what to expect.</li>

						<li>Do <strong>not</strong> slam on your brakes to stop on snow or ice. If you slam on the
						brakes, your vehicle will almost always skid. Instead, gently press the
						brakes and then release them.</li>

						<li>Watch for danger spots ahead. A bridge or shaded area freezes first
						and may still be icy after the rest of the road is free of ice.</li>

						<li>Remember that temperature plays a part in stopping ability. The road
						is likely to be the most slippery when ice is near the freezing point
						rather than at lower temperatures.</li>

						<li>When you go uphill on an ice-covered or snowy road, apply just
						enough power to maintain motion, without causing the wheels to spin.</li>

						<li>Pay attention to weather forecasts and police warnings. When police
						or highway officials say driving is very hazardous, stay off the road.</li>

						<li>Do not use cruise control.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Controlling a Skid</h5>

					<p>Skidding is one of the most dangerous driving situations. Skids occur
					when the tires can no longer grip the road. In the vast majority of cases,
					drivers traveling too fast for conditions cause skids.</p>

					<p>If your vehicle begins to skid:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Stay off the brakes</strong>. Until the vehicle slows, your brakes will not be
						effective. Using them could cause you to skid more.</li>

						<li><strong>Steer</strong>. Turn the steering wheel in the direction you want the vehicle to
						go. As soon as the vehicle begins to straighten out, turn the steering
						wheel back the other way. If you do not do this, your vehicle may
						swing around in the other direction and you could start a new skid.</li>

						<li><strong>Continue to steer</strong>. Continue to correct your steering, left and right,
						until the vehicle is again moving down the road under your control.</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">69</span></div>

					<h5>Chains and Traction Tires</h5>

					<p>When you drive in winter conditions, you may see signs that require
					you to carry or install chains or traction tires.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>“Chains” are link or cable chains, or any other device that attaches
						to the wheel, vehicle, or outside of the tire, which is specifically
						designed to increase traction on ice and snow conditions.</li>

						<figure>
							<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/110.png">
						</figure>

						<li>“Traction tires” are studded tires or tires that meet the tire
						industry definition as suitable for use in severe snow
						conditions. Tires designated by the tire industry display
						an icon of a three-peaked mountain and snowflake.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Studded tires are generally allowed in Oregon only from November 1 to
					April 1. Because of the damage caused by studded tires, they should only
					be used when necessary. Drivers should be aware that some states ban the
					use of studded tires.</p>

					<p>Some emergency vehicles and highway maintenance equipment are
					exempt from the requirement to use chains or traction tires. A four-wheel
					or all-wheel drive passenger vehicle or truck does not have to use chains
					if all of the following statements are true:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>It has an unloaded weight of 6,500 pounds or less.</li>

						<li>It is equipped and operated to provide power to both the front and rear
						wheels.</li>

						<li>Chains are being carried in the vehicle.</li>

						<li>It has mud and snow, all-weather radial, or traction tires on all its wheels.</li>

						<li>It is not towing a trailer or another vehicle.</li>

						<li>It is not being driven in a manner or under conditions that cause the
						vehicle to lose traction.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>More information on chain and traction tire requirements is available
					from the ODOT web site at <span class="url">www.tripcheck.com</span>.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="36" data-name="Safety Belts, Passengers, and Inside Distractions">

					<h4><span>Safety Belts, Passengers, and Inside Distractions</span></h4>

					<h5>Safety Belts, Child Safety Systems, and Air Bags</h5>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Proper safety belt use is mandatory in Oregon for all drivers and
					passengers in all available seating positions when the vehicle is in motion.</span></p>

					<p>A properly worn safety belt reduces the chance of injury in a crash. The
					<em>diagrams on Page 72</em> show the correct way to wear a safety belt. Failure
					to properly use the safety belt system as shown may result in unnecessary
					injuries if you are in a crash. If you leave slack in either the lap or
					shoulder portion of your safety belt, you risk being thrown out of the</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">70</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">vehicle during a crash or rollover. Only one in five people who are ejected
					from a motor vehicle survive. Your best protection to avoid serious injury
					in a crash is to wear your safety belt. Safety belts keep you in the safest
					place—inside your vehicle.</p>

					<p>You may be exempted from Oregon’s mandatory safety belt law if:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Your vehicle was not manufactured with safety belts, and belts have
						not been added since that time. (If belts have been added, drivers and
						passengers must use them.)</li>

						<li>You are the passenger in a vehicle where all seating positions with
						safety belts are occupied.</li>

						<li>You have been granted a medical exemption based on a doctor’s
						recommendation.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Additional exemptions can be found in <em>ORS 811.215</em>.</p>

					<p>Child passengers must be restrained in approved child safety seats until
					they weigh forty pounds or reach the upper weight limit for the car seat
					in use. Infants must ride rear-facing until they reach both one year of age
					AND twenty pounds.</p>

					<p>Children weighing more than 40 pounds or who have reached the upper
					weight limit for their forward-facing car seat must ride in a booster seat
					until they are age 8 or at least 4-feet 9-inches in height. Children over 8
					years old or taller than 4-feet 9-inches in height must use a safety belt
					system.</p>

					<p>National statistics indicate that children under 13 years of age are less
					likely to receive crash-related injuries when riding in the back seat. Child
					safety systems must meet all federal standards. For help in obtaining,
					selecting, or installing a child safety system, contact ACTS Oregon at
					(877) 793-2608 or <span class="url">www.childsafetyseat.org</span>.</p>

					<p>Most cars today have airbags in one or more locations inside the
					vehicle. Safety belts must be worn properly in order for the airbag to
					protect you. A properly worn safety belt holds you back against your seat
					so the airbag has room to fully infl ate around your body during a crash.
					Please refer to your vehicle owner’s manual to learn the locations of these
					systems since airbag locations may vary widely among different vehicles.</p>

					<p>Rear-facing child safety seats should never be placed in the front seat
					when an airbag is located in the dashboard. Information regarding airbag
					deactivation or on/off switch may be obtained by contacting the US
					Department of Transportation at (888) 327-4236 or <span class="url">www.safercar.gov</span>.</p>

					<h5>Inside Distractions</h5>

					<p>Being alert is an essential part of safe driving. The following are some
					distractions that might keep you from paying attention while driving:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Do not hold a package, pet, or person in your lap or arms.</strong> This
						could interfere with driving control, especially in an emergency, or
						with your view to the rear, front, or sides. If you are involved in a
						crash while holding a person or animal while driving, the person or
						animal may sustain serious injuries or death. Likewise, holding a
						package could cause the driver to sustain serious injuries or death.</li>

						<li>Children and pets can be noisy or demand your attention while you
						are driving. <strong>It is dangerous to take your eyes off the road to turn
						around to deal with the needs of children or pets.</strong> If you must give
						attention to young passengers or animals, try to wait until you are at a
						red light or stop sign. If possible, pull over to the side of the road and
						park your vehicle before dealing with your passengers or animals.</li>

						<li><strong>It is very dangerous to remove a coat or jacket while driving.</strong>
						Other activities such as applying makeup, reading maps, or reading
						the newspaper while driving are also dangerous. These types of
						activities can place you in serious danger of a crash.</li>

						<li><strong>It is dangerous to eat and drink while driving.</strong> A hectic schedule can
						pressure you to grab a quick lunch at a drive-thru window, but you are
						far safer to pull over and park while eating in your vehicle than to eat
						while you drive. Your reaction time is slowed if an emergency arises
						while you have one hand on the wheel and your other hand around a
						sandwich or a soft drink you are worried about spilling.</li>

						<li><strong>Mobile (cellular) telephones and other communication devices.</strong>
						Drivers 18 years of age and older are required by Oregon law to
						use a hands-free accessory. The key to using mobile telephones is
						to remember that driving is your primary mission while behind the
						wheel. You must pay attention at all times. By law, drivers under 18
						years of age are not allowed to use a mobile communication device
						while operating a vehicle.</li>

						<li><strong>It is illegal to play a radio or other sound system so loud that
						it can be heard 50 feet or more away from your vehicle.</strong> It is
						important that you be able to hear the sound of horns, screeching tires,
						and sirens. A loud radio could also prevent you from hearing other
						feedback such as a change in the sound coming from your tires that
						warns you of road surface changes, problems with your cars engine,
						or you may not realize that your turn signal is still activated. It is also
						dangerous to wear headphones while driving for these same reasons.</li>

						<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">73</span></div>

						<li><strong>It is illegal to have a TV or video monitor that is visible to the
						driver while operating a vehicle.</strong> This includes TV broadcasts or
						images from a digital video disc (DVD) or video game. Anything that
						distracts your eyes or attention from the road is dangerous.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>External Passengers</h5>

					<p>Oregon law prohibits anyone under 18 years old to ride on the hood,
					fender, running board, or other external part of a vehicle, including a
					pickup bed.</p>

					<p>Adults should not ride in a pickup bed or any external part of the
					vehicle. If you are in an accident, adults in the pickup bed who are not
					restrained are likely to be thrown from the vehicle, causing serious injury
					or even death.</p>

					<p>You cannot carry a dog on an external part of a vehicle, including a
					pickup bed, unless it is protected by framework, carrier, or other device to
					keep it from falling from the vehicle. A dog should ride in the back seat in
					a secured carrier or animal safety belt. Do not hold an animal in your lap
					or arms when driving.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="37" data-name="Dealing With Emergencies">

					<h4><span>Dealing With Emergencies</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Although most equipment failures can be avoided by good maintenance,
					there are times when equipment may still fail, resulting in a driving
					emergency that calls for you to take fast action.</span></p>

					<p>A vehicle needs maintenance. Otherwise, it becomes unsafe to drive and
					wastes fuel. Tires, brakes, steering, and lights should be checked often.
					Know your vehicle. Check your vehicle owner’s manual. An engine tuneup
					at regular intervals will improve fuel economy and lessen the risk of an
					engine failure that could tie up traffic or even cause a crash.</p>

					<p>Check your tires for correct tire pressure, uneven tread wear, and cuts or
					bumps that might cause a blowout. Bald tires skid easily and require more
					stopping distance on wet roads. Maintain tires at recommended pressures
					for both safety and fuel economy. Routinely check tire pressure when tires
					are cold.</p>

					<p>Any of the following signals may warn you of trouble with your brakes:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>The pedal, when depressed, is less than 1.5 inches from the floor.</li>

						<li>The vehicle pulls right or left when you apply the brakes.</li>

						<li>An intermittent chirping sound may come from disc brakes.</li>

						<li>A metal-to-metal grinding sound occurs when you depress the brake pedal.</li>

						<li>The brakes tend to grab or take hold violently.</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">74</span></div>

					<h5>Blowouts</h5>

					<p>If a front tire blows, there may be a strong pull toward the side with the
					blowout. A rear blowout causes the back of the vehicle to weave or sway.
					Grip the steering wheel firmly and steer straight down the center of your
					lane. Do not oversteer. Slow down. Then brake smoothly. Move slowly
					to the shoulder and find a safe place to stop and change the tire or call for
					roadside service.</p>

					<h5>Brakes Fail</h5>

					<p>If your brakes fail, what you should do depends on what type of brakes
					you have. That is one reason you should always study your vehicle
					owner’s manual before you drive. If you cannot get your brakes to work,
					and the way ahead is clear, slowly apply the parking brake. You may need
					to shift to a lower gear so the engine can help slow you, but keep the
					transmission in gear. On a hill or mountain grade, look for something to
					sideswipe—a curb, roadside brush, snow bank, or guardrail—anything
					that will help you slow down. Use your horn or lights to warn others that
					you are out of control.</p>

					<h5>Headlights Go Out</h5>

					<p>Try your dimmer switch, or flick the headlight switch, turn signals,
					or hazard lights. This may give you enough light to guide you off the
					road. Slow down immediately and ease off onto the shoulder as soon as
					possible. Once stopped, warn other traffic by using your hazard lights,
					flares or reflective devices.</p>

					<h5>Power Steering Fails</h5>

					<p>If your power steering fails because your engine has stopped, you
					should grip the steering wheel firmly, as steering will be hard. Steer the
					vehicle onto the side of the road and stop the vehicle. You may have to
					push the brakes hard if your vehicle also has power brakes.</p>

					<h5>Steering Wheel Locking Device</h5>

					<p>Never turn your vehicle’s ignition to the “lock” position while it is
					still in motion. This will cause the steering to lock if you try to turn the
					steering wheel, and you will lose control of your vehicle.</p>

					<h5>Hood Flies Up</h5>

					<p>Brake smoothly, ease onto the shoulder, and stop. You will have to
					depend on the view from your left window for steering reference, but on
					some vehicles, you may be able to peek through the gap under the hinge
					edge of the hood.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">75</span></div>

					<h5>Accelerator Sticks</h5>

					<p>Stay calm. Keep your eyes on the road ahead and search for an escape
					path. Shift the vehicle to neutral using an open palm. Steer smoothly while
					continuing to brake. Pull off the roadway when it is safe to do so and turn
					off the engine.</p>

					<h5>Engine Overheats</h5>

					<p>If your engine overheats, stop in a safe place off the road. Set the brakes
					and move the shift lever to neutral or park. Raise the hood, but do not try
					to remove the radiator cap. Idle the engine to increase air flow. Turn on
					the heater or, if the vehicle is air conditioned, turn off the air conditioner
					and turn on the heater until the temperature gets back to normal. If the
					temperature does not begin to drop after a short time, turn off the engine.
					Your vehicle may need to be towed to a service center.</p>

					<h5>Utility Pole Collision</h5>

					<p>If your vehicle crashes into a utility pole, always assume there is a
					power line down and it is energized and extremely dangerous. If possible,
					stay in the vehicle. Do not open the door. The safest course of action is to
					call 911 and remain in the vehicle until help arrives.</p>

					<p>Only get out of the vehicle if fire, smoke, or other hazards make staying
					in the vehicle unsafe. If you must exit the vehicle, remain calm. Look
					around to determine the safest exit point, being sure to look up and around
					your vehicle for power lines or other hazards. <strong>Do not touch the vehicle
					and the ground at the same time.</strong> Open the door, but do <strong>not</strong> step outside.
					Turn to face the doorway and jump free of the vehicle, keeping your feet
					together and your arms and hands close to your body. Continue jumping
					until you are safely away from danger.</p>

					<p>If you witness a collision involving a utility pole, stay away from the
					vehicle. Do not touch any of the passengers in the vehicle, and avoid
					touching any nearby fences or wires. The safest course of action is to call
					911 to report a collision involving power lines and wait for the power
					company to arrive.</p>

					<h5>Fuel Saving Techniques</h5>

					<p>Drivers can improve their gas mileage and save on fuel consumption
					and expense by adopting simple steps. By following the tips below, you
					can reduce your monthly costs considerably.</p>

					<p>Drive more efficiently: Avoid exceeding posted speed limits, aggressive
					driving, “jack rabbit” starts, and unnecessary idling or morning warm-ups
					(more than a minute). Drive steadily and allow your vehicle to slow down</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">76</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">when you see a red light ahead. Combine errands, use cruise control when
					appropriate, use air conditioning conservatively, and keep windows closed
					at high speeds. Remove excess weight from the trunk and avoid packing
					items on top of your car. Use public transportation or commute in a car
					or vanpool.</p>

					<p>Properly maintain your vehicle: Do maintenance according to your
					owner’s manual, checking spark plugs, oil, and air fi ters. Inflate, rotate, and
					balance tires according to your vehicle manufacturers’ recommendation.</p>

					<p>Use the recommended fuel. Most cars require regular octane. Using a
					higher octane offers no added benefit. Keep your fuel tank at least a quarter
					full. It is illegal to “top off” the gas tank in Oregon and the fuel needs room
					to expand. If possible, purchase fuel at the coolest times of day.</p>

				<h1>Section 5</h1>

				<h2><span>Sharing the Road</span></h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">Drivers of passenger vehicles share the road with many other users:
				pedestrians, bicyclists, moped and motorcycle riders, trucks and buses,
				recreational vehicles, and other passenger vehicles of all shapes and sizes.</span>
				As a driver or user of the road, you need to know and practice the rules
				of the road. You should always be aware of the traffic around you and be
				prepared for emergency situations.</p>

				<p>There are many vulnerable users of a public way, crosswalk or shoulder
				of the highway. A pedestrian, highway worker, a person riding an animal
				or an individual operating a bicycle are a few of these individuals. Any
				driving offense that causes serious injury or death of a vulnerable user
				may result in a license suspension, increased fines, or even a jail sentence.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="39" data-name="Pedestrians">

					<h4><span>Pedestrians</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Drivers must recognize the special safety needs of pedestrians.</span> Drivers
					should be especially alert for pedestrians who are young, elderly,
					disabled, or intoxicated. They are the most frequent victims in autopedestrian
					collisions.</p>

					<p>Generally, pedestrians have the right of way at all intersections. There is
					a crosswalk at every intersection, even if it is not marked by painted lines.</p>

					<p>To determine where an unmarked crosswalk is, imagine that the
					sidewalk or shoulder at the corner extends across the road and meets
					the sidewalk or shoulder on the other side of the road. By law, the area
					included in the unmarked crosswalk is not less than 6 feet wide and exists
					even if there is no sidewalk or shoulder.</p>

					<p>Drivers must not block the crosswalk when stopped at a red light. Do
					not stop with any portion of your vehicle overhanging the crosswalk area.
					Blocking a crosswalk forces pedestrians to go around your vehicle and
					puts them in a dangerous situation.</p>

					<p>A pedestrian is crossing the roadway when any part or extension of the
					pedestrian moves onto the roadway in a crosswalk with intent to cross.
					This may include, but is not limited to, any part of the pedestrian’s body,
					wheelchair, cane, crutch, or bicycle.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">79</span></div>

					<figure>
						<img class="centered-img" src="/contents/dmv/images/116.png">
					</figure>

					<p>At an intersection where pedestrians are crossing, you must wait until
					the pedestrians have cleared your lane and the entire next lane before
					you may go. If you are turning at a signal, you must stop and wait until
					pedestrians clear the lane you are turning in to, plus 6 feet of the next lane.</p>

					<p>You are not required to stop for a pedestrian in a crosswalk if you are
					traveling along the half of the roadway that is on the other side of a safety
					island from the pedestrian.</p>

					<p>You <strong>must stop and remain stopped</strong> for pedestrians on the sidewalk
					when entering or leaving an alley, driveway, or private road.</p>

					<p>Remember: There is a crosswalk at every intersection regardless of
					whether or not it is marked by painted lines.</p>

					<h5>White Canes and Guide Dogs</h5>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/117.png">
					</figure>

					<p>Pedestrians who are blind or
					partially blind may carry a white cane
					or use the assistance of a guide dog.
					You must give the right of way to a
					pedestrian who is carrying a white
					cane or using a guide dog. <strong>Stop
					and stay stopped</strong> if the person is
					attempting to cross or is in the process of crossing the road. At regulated
					intersections, remain stopped until the pedestrian has crossed the roadway,
					even if you have a green light.</p>

					<h5>Stopped Vehicles</h5>

					<p>Do not pass a vehicle stopped at a crosswalk. This is a frequent cause of
					death to pedestrians, especially if the passing vehicle is traveling at a high
					speed. When stopping for a pedestrian at a crosswalk on a multi-lane road,
					you should stop about 30 feet before the crosswalk so you do not block
					the visibility of the driver in another lane.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">80</span></div>

					<h5>School Zones</h5>

					<p>Be particularly alert at all times for children and pedestrians in a school
					zone. Follow the signs or flashing lights that warn you that you are
					approaching a school or a school crossing. School hours are not the only
					time children are present. You must obey the slower posted speed limit of
					20 mph in school speed zones under the following circumstances:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Any time a yellow light on a school speed sign is flashing, indicating
						that children are arriving at or leaving school.</li>

						<li>Between the hours of 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. on school days, as posted on
						signs in a school zone adjacent to school grounds.</li>

						<li>
							Any time children are present at a school crosswalk not adjacent to
							school grounds, which means:

							<ul>
								<li>children are waiting at a crosswalk.</li>

								<li>children are occupying or walking within a crosswalk.</li>

								<li>a traffic patrol member is present to assist children at a crosswalk.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Stop and yield to students who are crossing and when a traffic patrol
					member signals you to do so. Police may cite you if you do not stop or
					yield the right of way to students who are crossing. If you are unsure
					whether or not it is a school day, slow down to 20 mph when entering a
					school zone.</p>

					<p>Signs may be posted in school zones notifying drivers that traffic fines
					are higher in a school zone.</p>

					<h5>Children at Play</h5>

					<p>As a driver, be extra careful in residential areas and at times and places
					where children are likely to be around, such as a park. Do not drive too
					close to parked cars that may block your view. Teach your own children
					the basics of being a safe pedestrian at an early age. Always be extra
					watchful when backing in or out of a driveway. Children may run behind
					or be playing behind your vehicle.</p>

					<h5>You as a Pedestrian</h5>

					<p>Although drivers must yield to pedestrians in crosswalks, pedestrians
					must not suddenly leave a curb or other safe waiting place and walk
					into the path of a vehicle if it is so close that it is an immediate hazard.
					Vehicles cannot stop instantly.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">81</span></div>

					<p>When walking, do all you can to make yourself visible to help drivers
					prevent collisions. You should wear bright clothing and use clothing
					reflectors or carry a light at night. Pedestrians must:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Use crosswalks at intersections.</li>

						<li>Follow the pedestrian signals. Be aware of traffic at all times while in
						the crosswalk.</li>

						<li>Yield to traffic on the road if crossing at a location other than
						a crosswalk.</li>

						<li>Look in both directions for oncoming traffic before crossing any street.</li>

						<li>Walk on the sidewalk next to the road.</li>

						<li>Use jogging paths when provided. After dark or in bad weather, jog in
						well-lighted areas and wear plenty of reflective clothing.</li>

						<li>If there is no sidewalk, walk or jog on the left shoulder facing
						oncoming traffic.</li>

						<li>Walk as far as possible from the edge of the road.</li>

						<li>Yield to motor vehicles when there is no sidewalk or shoulder.</li>

						<li>Walk to the nearest exit to get help on a freeway. Pedestrians may walk in
						either direction on the side of the freeway where the vehicle is disabled.</li>
					</ul>

				</section>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="40" data-name="Bicycles">

					<h4><span>Bicycles</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Bicycle use on streets and highways is growing daily, both for exercise
					and transportation in city areas.</span> The same traffic rules and regulations
					apply to both bicyclists and vehicle drivers.</p>

					<p>A major problem for drivers is the ability to see bicyclists, especially
					at night. Sometimes they may be in the blind spot of your vehicle. When
					you approach a bicyclist, keep on the lookout and slow down. To avoid
					conflict, drivers of motor vehicles need to know the following rules:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Do not drive in a bicycle lane. You may cross a bicycle lane when
						turning or when entering or leaving an alley, driveway, or private
						road. Do not move into a bicycle lane in preparation for a turn.</li>

						<li>You may use a bicycle lane as part of an official duty, such as
						delivering mail. Farm equipment may briefly use a bicycle lane to let
						other traffic pass.</li>

						<li>You must yield to bicyclists in a bicycle lane or on a sidewalk, before
						you turn across the lane or sidewalk.</li>

						<li>You must yield to bicyclists at intersections, the same as you do for
						other types of vehicles.</li>

						<li>
							When you are traveling at a speed greater than 35 mph, you may only
							pass a bicyclist by driving to the left when the passing distance is

							<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">82</span></div>

							sufficient to prevent contact with the person operating the bicycle if
							the person were to fall into the driver’s lane.
						</li>

						<li>The same rules for passing other vehicles apply to bicycles. Be aware
						that you must follow the rules of the road in no passing zones as noted
						on Pages 45-46. If you can not pass safely, you must slow down and
						remain behind the bicycle until it is safe to pass.</li>

						<li>Do not honk at a bicyclist, unless you have good cause to warn the
						rider you are close by. The loud noise could startle the rider. There
						may be a good reason for the bicyclist to be riding in the travel lane,
						such as roadway hazards not visible to motorists.</li>

						<li>Operators of motorized wheelchairs, scooters, and personal assistive
						mobility devices are permitted to use bicycle lanes and paths. These
						vehicles can not exceed a speed limit of 15 mph. You must yield to
						these operators before you turn across the bicycle lane or path.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Drivers need to remember that bicyclists often must react differently to
					road hazards than drivers of motor vehicles. These hazards could include
					potholes, glass, litter, storm grates, and railroad crossings, as well as opened
					doors of parked vehicles. Any of these items could cause a bicyclist to move
					into your path or to slow down. Give bicyclists plenty of clearance on the
					street so they will have room to move around these hazards.</p>

					<p>The actions of an inexperienced bicyclist will be less predictable. Look
					for signs that tell you a bicyclist is inexperienced, such as whether the
					bicycle rider is riding in a smooth and straight manner, riding against
					traffic, or is weaving and wobbling.</p>

					<p>Children on bicycles should be given extra consideration. They believe
					others will look out for them and may lack a sense of danger. Be aware
					that their actions could be very unpredictable.</p>

					<h5>Collisions with Bicyclists</h5>

					<p>Several common errors can cause you to strike a bicyclist:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Turning left without noticing an oncoming bicyclist.</li>

						<li>Turning right at an intersection or driveway without checking for a
						bicyclist on the right who is continuing straight ahead or a bicyclist
						coming from the opposite direction in front of you.</li>

						<li>Entering or crossing a street without checking for a bicyclist in the
						street or on the sidewalk.</li>

						<li>Opening a vehicle door into the path of a bicyclist or swerving into a
						bicycle lane.</li>

						<li>Trucks, RVs, and vehicles pulling trailers with wide mirrors passing
						too close to a bicyclist.</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">83</span></div>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/118.png">
					</figure>

					<h5>Bike Boxes</h5>

					<p>The bike box helps prevent collisions
					between motorists and bicycles at
					intersections. It is typically a painted box
					on the road with a white bicycle symbol
					inside. Bicycle lanes approaching and
					leaving the box may also be painted.
					As a driver, you must stop for a traffic
					signal behind the bike box. Do not stop
					in the box. Bicyclists will move into the
					box, in front of your vehicle or other
					traffic, at the intersection. No right turns
					are allowed at these intersections when
					the traffic signal is red. If turning right
					on a green light, you must signal and
					watch for bicyclists on the right.</p>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/119.png">
					</figure>

					<h5>Sharrow</h5>

					<p>A bicycle sharrow, two chevrons painted above a bicycle
					symbol on the road, indicates the lane is shared. Vehicle
					or bicycle traffic may be in the lane. Although you should
					always keep on the lookout for bicyclists, this serves as an
					additional warning to watch for bicycles in the lane.</p>

					<h5>Bicycle Helmets</h5>

					<p>Oregon law requires anyone less than 16 years old to wear approved
					protective headgear when riding or being carried on a bicycle. As a
					parent or person with legal responsibility for the safety and welfare of a
					child, you will be held responsible. Although not required by law, bicycle
					helmets are strongly recommended for persons age 16 and older.</p>

					<h5>Bicyclist Riding Rules</h5>

					<p>To become more confi dent in your riding skills, please obtain the
					Oregon Bicyclist Manual at your local DMV office or online at
					<span class="url">www.oregon.gov/ODOT/HWY/BIKEPED</span>.</p>

					<p>As a bicyclist in Oregon, you must be aware that bicycles are considered
					vehicles. You have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as
					vehicle drivers.</p>

					<p>Bicyclists must ride in the direction of traffic and as near to the right
					side of the road or street as is practical. On a one-way street in a city, a</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">84</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">bicyclist may ride as near as practical to either the right or left side of the
					street or roadway.</p>

					<p>There are some exceptions to this rule, such as when a bicyclist is
					overtaking and passing another bicycle or vehicle, when a bicyclist is
					getting ready to make a left turn, or when a bicyclist is riding at the same
					speed as traffic. A bicyclist also does not need to keep right if a lane is too
					narrow to let a bicycle and vehicle travel side-by-side or if riding close
					to the edge of the roadway is unsafe because of parked vehicles, fi xed or
					moving objects, animals, or road surface hazards. Bicyclists may ride side-by-
					side along Oregon roads, but only if it does not impede other traffic.</p>

					<p>Increase your visibility. It will help protect you on the road. Brightly
					colored clothing during the day and white or reflectorized clothing at night
					will help you be seen. At night, you must have a headlight and rear reflector
					on your bicycle; a red taillight and additional reflectors are also helpful.</p>

					<p>Other rules include: signal before making a turn or a stop (see <em>Page 38</em>),
					always keep at least one hand on the handlebars, don’t carry more
					passengers than there are seats available, yield to pedestrians, have adequate
					brakes, and never perform stunts while riding on streets or highways.</p>

				</section>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="41" data-name="Motorcycles and Mopeds">

					<h4><span>Motorcycles and Mopeds</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Motorcycle riders have the same rights and responsibilities on public
					roads as other highway users.</span></p>

					<p>There is no question that a motorcycle or moped is more difficult to see
					than other vehicles. They are easily hidden in a vehicle’s blind spot and
					can be easily overlooked in heavy traffic.</p>

					<p>It is difficult to judge how far away a motorcycle is or tell how fast it is
					going. Being alert to these special visual problems and how motorcyclists
					react to some situations can help you avoid colliding with a motorcyclist
					in traffic.</p>

					<p>Tailgating is dangerous and against the law. When following a
					motorcycle, always allow more distance between your vehicle and the
					motorcycle than you would another car. It is best to maintain a 3-4 second
					following distance behind a motorcycle.</p>

					<p>It is against the law to share a lane with a motorcyclist. When passing
					a motorcycle or moped, a driver must allow a full lane to the motorcycle
					or moped.</p>

					<p>Intersections are the most likely places for crashes. The most frequent
					causes of collisions between motorcycles and other motor vehicles are
					drivers who fail to yield right of way or who make a left turn in front</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">85</span></div>

					<p>of an oncoming motorcycle. Look once, then look again. You have the 
					same duty to yield to an oncoming motorcycle as for any other type of 
					vehicle when you are making a left turn. If you are not sure how fast the 
					motorcycle is going, it is safest to wait until it passes to make the turn.
					
					<p>Turn signals do not automatically cancel on most motorcycles and the 
					rider may forget to turn the signal off. Before you make a turn in front of 
					an oncoming motorcycle that has its turn signal on, be sure the rider is 
					actually turning rather than riding with their signal on unintentionally.</p>
					
					<p>Bad weather and slippery roads cause even greater problems for 
					motorcycle and moped riders than for other vehicles. Wet roads cause 
					traction problems. Skilled motorcycle riders will slow down. Strong 
					crosswinds can move a motorcycle out of its lane of travel. As the driver 
					of a vehicle, you need to be aware of these situations so you can respond 
					appropriately to share the road safely with motorcycles and mopeds.</p>
					
					<p>Road surfaces that do not normally affect other vehicles can create 
					problems for the cyclist. Gravel, debris, pavement seams, grooved 
					pavement, small animals, and even manhole covers may cause the rider to 
					change speed or direction.</p>
					
					<p>Be aware of how weather conditions and road surfaces affect 
					motorcycles and mopeds and increase your following distance. Keep in 
					mind how difficult it is to tell how fast a motorcycle is going and think 
					about it before turning in front of one. Better yet, wait until it passes to 
					turn. Follow the laws and these suggestions to share the road safely with 
					motorcycles and mopeds.</p>

				</section>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="42" data-name="Recreational Vehicles">

					<h4>Recreational Vehicles</h4>

					<p>Most recreational vehicles (RVs)—including motor homes, campers, 
					and travel trailers—are longer, higher, and wider than other passenger 
					vehicles. They take longer to accelerate and to stop, and require much 
					more room to turn.</p>
					
					<p>Drivers of RVs used for personal, non-commercial purposes need only a 
					Class C license.</p>

					<h5>Driving Courtesy</h5>

					<p>When you drive a pickup with a camper, drive a motor home, or tow 
					a travel trailer or boat trailer, you should often check your speed and 
					the traffic behind you. If traffic is stacking up behind you, it is safer for 
					everyone if you pull off at the first safe turnout to let other traffic pass. 
					Use the right lane on roads with two or more lanes of traffic going in the 
					same direction.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">86</span></div>

					<h5>Corners and Curves</h5>

					<p>Trailer wheels do not follow the path of the towing vehicle’s wheels.
					The longer the vehicle, the greater the “off-track.” This means you should
					steer wider on corners when towing a trailer, so the trailer will clear the
					curb and other vehicles.</p>

					<p>Stay away from the pavement edge on sharp right curves and keep away
					from the center line on left curves. On sharp or tight curves, you should
					lead the turning arc of the front wheels according to how sharp the curve
					is and the amount of off-track of your vehicle or combination of vehicles.
					Take curves at a reduced speed that is consistent with your ability to see
					ahead, the sharpness of the curve, and other road and traffic conditions.</p>

					<h5>Passing</h5>

					<p>Trailers give you extra weight and length. Acceleration will be sluggish
					and you will need more room than usual to overtake another vehicle.
					When you pass, be sure you do not cut in too soon or you will clip the
					vehicle you just passed.</p>

					<h5>Stopping</h5>

					<p>Avoid situations that call for a sudden stop. Increase the following
					distance between your vehicle and the traffic ahead of you. Trailer
					brakes should be adjusted to the load and activated by the towing
					vehicle’s brakes.</p>

					<h5>Backing</h5>

					<p>Try to minimize situations where you have to back up. If you must back
					up, try to position your vehicle so you can back in a straight line. If you
					must back on a curved path, try to get yourself in a position so that the
					trailer turns to the left where you can see it from the driver’s side. Before
					you start backing, make sure nothing is behind you. The best approach is
					to have someone stand outside to help guide you. Check your mirrors on
					both sides while backing.</p>

					<p>When backing a trailer, turn the steering wheel of the vehicle towing
					the trailer in the opposite direction you want the trailer to go. Once the
					trailer starts to turn, you must turn the steering wheel the other way so
					that your vehicle follows the trailer.</p>

					<p>If the trailer starts to drift off course, correct this by turning the steering
					wheel in the direction of the drift.</p>

					<h5>Passengers</h5>

					<p>It is against the law to allow passengers to ride in a camper or any type
					of trailer, except a commercial bus trailer, an independently-steered trailer,</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">87</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">or a trailer towed with a fifth-wheel device. To carry passengers in a fifth-wheel
					trailer it must have safety glazing materials in windows and doors
					with windows. It must also have a way for passengers in the trailer to get
					the driver’s attention by a visual signal or sound. At least one unobstructed
					exit that opens from both inside and outside is also required.</p>

					<h5>Towing</h5>

					<p>Oregon law allows you to tow a maximum of one boat, general utility
					trailer, or other vehicle behind a passenger or recreational vehicle. You
					cannot tow a second trailer or vehicle behind a travel trailer or fifth-wheel
					trailer.</p>

					<h5>Towing on Wet Roads</h5>

					<p>On a wet road, narrow tires on small-wheeled trailers can hydroplane
					while the tow vehicle runs normally. On a curve, a hydroplaning trailer
					may fishtail or even tear loose. Gusty winds also can be a problem
					when you are towing a trailer. Watch your speed, especially in wet or
					windy weather.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="43" data-name="Large Vehicles and Trailers">

					<h4><span>Large Vehicles and Trailers</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">If you are operating a large truck, such as a rented moving van, or
					pulling a trailer, you should be extra cautious.</span> Be aware that it takes
					more time to stop safely. Allow more space between yourself and other
					vehicles. Follow the safety recommendations in the next section titled
					Trucks and Buses.</p>

					<p>All trailers must have lights and safety chains. Certain trailers must
					display registration plates. In Oregon, trailer brakes are not required,
					but are strongly recommended. You must be able to stop your combined
					vehicles within a reasonable distance. Properly working trailer brakes
					increase your combined vehicle’s ability to stop. For more information
					visit <span class="url">www.oregon.gov/ODOT/TS/Veh_Equipment.shtml</span>. To be safe,
					know the tongue weight and hauling capacity of your trailer and the
					maximum capacity of the towing unit to be sure you do not operate the
					vehicle overloaded.</p>

				</section>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="44" data-name="Trucks and Buses">

					<h4><span>Trucks and Buses</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Most people realize that it is more difficult to drive a truck or bus than
					a car or pickup, but many don’t know exactly what limitations apply to
					a large truck or bus.</span> Generally, the bigger the vehicle the bigger its blind
					spots. It needs more room to maneuver. It takes longer to stop or pass.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">88</span></div>

					<p>To share the road safely, avoid driving directly behind a truck. Keep a
					reasonable distance between your car and the truck ahead. You will have a
					better view of the road to anticipate problems, and you will give yourself
					an emergency “out.”</p>

					<p>Many motorists falsely assume that truck and bus drivers can see the
					road better because they sit higher than the driver of a small vehicle.
					Although a truck or bus does enjoy a better forward view and has bigger
					mirrors, it has serious blind spots into which a small vehicle can disappear
					from view. An excellent rule for motorists sharing the road with trucks
					and buses is: If you can’t see the truck or bus driver in the side mirror of
					the truck or bus, the driver can’t see you. These blind spots represent areas
					around trucks where crashes are more likely to occur.</p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Side blind spots</strong> - Trucks and buses have much larger blind spots on
						both sides of their vehicles than small vehicles. When you drive in
						these blind spots truck and bus drivers cannot see you. If the truck or
						bus driver needs to swerve or change lanes for any reason, a serious
						crash could occur if any vehicle is in the blind spot.</li>

						<li><strong>Rear blind spot</strong> - Unlike small vehicles, trucks and buses have deep
						blind spots directly behind them. Avoid following too closely. The
						truck or bus driver cannot see the vehicle in this position, and you
						severely reduce your own view of traffic flow. Following too closely
						greatly increases your chance of a collision with a truck or bus.</li>

						<figure>
							<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/120.png">
						</figure>

						<li><strong>Unsafe passing</strong> - Another dangerous area is just in front of trucks and
						buses. When vehicles cut in too soon after passing and then abruptly
						slow down, trucks and buses are forced to compensate with little time
						or room to spare.
						It takes longer to pass a large vehicle.
						Maintain a constant speed and be sure
						you can see the entire cab of the truck or
						bus in your rearview mirror before pulling
						in front. Leave more space for trucks and
						buses. Also, do not linger when passing a
						truck or bus. By remaining in blind spots
						too long, you make it impossible for the
						driver to safely take evasive action if an
						obstacle appears in the road ahead.</li>

						<li>
							<strong>Turns</strong> - Truck and bus drivers often cannot see vehicles directly
							behind or beside them when they are attempting to safely negotiate
							a turn or roundabout. Observe their turn signals. Cutting in between
							the truck or bus and the curb or shoulder increases the possibility
							of a crash. Large vehicles may need to use more than one lane in a

							<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">89</span></div>

							roundabout. Do not travel beside or attempt to pass a truck within a
							roundabout. Be aware of long loads that may extend into adjacent
							lanes during a turn. When you see a truck or bus making a turn, do not
							crowd the intersection; allow the truck to complete the turn.
						</li>

						<li><strong>Backing up</strong> - When a truck is backing up, it sometimes must block
						the street to maneuver its trailer accurately. Never cross behind a
						truck that is preparing to back up or is in the process of backing up.
						Most trailers are 8.5 feet wide and can completely hide objects that
						suddenly come between them and a loading area.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Some other things you need to know about trucks and buses include:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Braking </strong>- Trucks and buses take longer to stop than small vehicles
						traveling at the same speed. It takes a fully loaded truck with a trailer
						about three times the distance to stop than the average passenger
						vehicle. If roads are wet or slippery, trucks with trailers cannot fi rmly
						apply their brakes without risking a jackknife.</li>

						<li><strong>Maintaining a safe cushion and maneuverability</strong> - Trucks and
						buses need more maneuvering room than small vehicles. Don’t cut in
						front of a truck or bus. Otherwise, you remove the driver’s cushion of
						safety. When following a truck or bus, it is a good idea to add more
						following distance. If rain or water is standing on the road, the spray
						from a truck passing you, or one you are trying to pass, will seriously
						reduce your vision. You should move as far away from the truck as
						you can, while staying in your lane. Do not pull up too close behind a
						stopped truck or bus. It may roll back slightly when starting forward.
						Don’t drive too close to trucks that carry hazardous materials, since
						they may make frequent stops, such as at railroad crossings.</li>

						<li><strong>Hills or mountain roads</strong> - Beware of dangers caused by slower
						moving trucks or buses on hills or mountain roads. Watch for slow
						moving trucks or buses going both up and down hills. Heavy vehicles
						cannot maintain speed when climbing hills and must go slowly down
						hills to stay under control. Watch for trucks or buses that may be in
						trouble. Smoking wheels or a high speed can be a sign of brake loss.
						If you encounter this situation, fall back, and do not pass.</li>

						<li><strong>Runaway ramps</strong> - These ramps are designed to stop out-of-control
						trucks or buses. Small vehicles should never stop or park in these areas.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Licensing Requirements</h5>

					<p>A person operating any of the following vehicles will need a
					commercial driver license:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>A single vehicle with a loaded weight or gross vehicle weight rating
						(GVWR) of more than 26,000 pounds.</li>

						<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">90</span></div>

						<li>A vehicle towing a trailer that has a loaded weight or GVWR of
						more than 10,000 pounds, if the total loaded weight or GVWR of the
						combined vehicles is more than 26,000 pounds.</li>

						<li>A vehicle designed to transport 16 or more passengers (including
						the driver).</li>

						<li>Any size vehicle used to transport hazardous material in a quantity
						that requires display of placards or a material that is listed as a select
						agent or toxin in federal regulations.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Additional testing <strong>is required</strong> to operate these vehicles. If you
					wish to study for a commercial driver license, the <span class="italic">Oregon Commercial
					Motor Vehicle Manual</span> is available at all DMV offices, or online at:

						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/121.png">
					</figure>

					<h5>Stopping for School Buses</h5>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Oregon school buses have
					flashing amber and flashing red
					lights near the top of the bus on
					the front and rear.</span> School buses are
					also equipped with a stop arm that
					extends out from the left side of the
					bus near the driver’s window. The
					stop arm will extend when the red
					lights begin to flash.</p>

					<p>School bus drivers turn on
					flashing amber lights to warn
					other traffic that the bus is about to
					stop on the road to load or unload
					children. You should get ready to
					stop. When the red lights begin to
					flash, this means drivers meeting
					or overtaking the bus from either
					direction must stop before reaching
					the bus. You must remain stopped
					until the bus driver turns off the
					flashing red lights.</p>

					<p>The school bus stop law applies
					on any roadway with two or
					more lanes of traffic. There is one</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">91</span></div>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/122.png">
					</figure>

					<p>exception to the law. If you are on
					a divided highway with two roads
					separated by an unpaved median
					strip or barrier, you must stop only
					if you are on the same side of the
					road as the bus. A painted median
					strip or a center lane used only
					for left turns does not create two
					separate roads. Where this situation
					exists, <strong>all</strong> lanes of traffic must stop.</p>

					<p>School bus drivers may report
					vehicles that improperly pass school
					buses. The report may be forwarded to the local law enforce ment agency
					for investigation.</p>

					<p>All school buses and some school activity vehicles must stop at railroad
					crossings. The driver must open the bus door and be sure the tracks are
					clear before proceeding.</p>

					<h5>Church and Worker Buses</h5>

					<p>Flashing amber and red lights also are permitted on church buses used
					to carry children and on buses used to transport workers. If these buses
					are equipped with these lights and use either the flashing amber or red
					lights, other drivers must either get ready to stop or stop the same as for
					school buses.</p>

					<h5>Public Transit Buses</h5>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/123.png">
					</figure>

					<p>Public transit buses often pull to a curb to load or unload passengers. To
					help protect these buses and their passengers when they re-enter a traffic
					lane, drivers of other vehicles approaching from the rear
					must yield when a bus driver signals to re-enter a traffic
					lane and there is an electric sign flashing “yield” on the
					back of the bus.</p>

					<p>Police may cite a driver who does not yield right of
					way to the bus.</p>

					<h5>Bus Drivers</h5>

					<p>A person operating a school bus or any vehicle designed to transport
					16 or more passengers (including the driver) will need a commercial
					driver license.</p>

					<p>Additional testing is required to operate these vehicles. If you wish to study

				<section class="subsection" data-number="46" data-name="Emergency Vehicles">

					<h4><span>Emergency Vehicles</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Drivers of emergency vehicles, such as police, ambulance, and fire
					trucks, must drive with regard for the safety of other highway users.</span>
					However, they may break some traffic laws if the drivers are on their way
					to an emergency or chasing a violator. Drivers of emergency vehicles
					must stop—the same as other traffic—for a stopped school bus, church
					bus, or worker transportation vehicle that has its flashing red lights in use.</p>

					<p>Emergency vehicle drivers may:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Park or stand in places where drivers otherwise could not do so.</li>

						<li>Go through a red light or stop sign after slowing down.</li>

						<li>Drive faster than a designated speed, if it does not endanger people
						or property.</li>

						<li>Disregard rules covering direction of movement or turning. To break
						these rules, emergency vehicle drivers must use emergency vehicle
						warning lights. When going through a stop sign or red traffic light,
						emergency drivers also must use a siren or other audible warning
						device, unless use would prevent or hamper catching a violator.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Yielding to Emergency Vehicles</h5>

					<p>You must yield right of way to emergency vehicles, such as fire trucks,
					police vehicles, and ambulances, when these vehicles approach you from
					any direction using a light or siren.</p>

					<p>When you see or hear an emergency vehicle warning, you <strong>must</strong>
					immediately drive as close as is safely practical to the right-hand edge or
					curb of the road, clear of any intersection, and <strong>STOP</strong>. Stay stopped until the
					emergency vehicle has passed or until a police officer tells you to move.</p>

					<h5>Following Emergency Vehicles</h5>

					<p>Follow no closer than 500 feet behind an emergency vehicle answering
					an alarm. Do not drive or park in a way that interferes with emergency
					vehicles responding to an emergency.</p>

					<h5>Approaching an Emergency Vehicle or Tow Truck</h5>

					<p>If you are on a road with two or more lanes of traffic and you approach
					an emergency vehicle, tow truck or roadside assistance vehicle that is
					stopped with warning lights on, you must change lanes so you do not
					drive next to the stopped vehicle. If making a lane change is unsafe or you
					are on a road with one lane in each direction, you must reduce your speed</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">93</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">by at least 5 miles per hour under the posted speed limit and give the
					emergency vehicle as much room as safely possible.</p>

					<p>When you approach emergency scenes, slow down and be prepared to
					stop. Do not drive over unprotected fire hoses unless directed to do so by a
					fire department official or law enforcement officer at the scene.</p>

					<figure>
						<img class="centered-img" src="/contents/dmv/images/124.png">
					</figure>

					<h5>Police Stops</h5>

					<p>Police vehicles attempting to stop drivers will do so by means of a
					visual (flashing blue or flashing blue and red lights) or audible signal. If
					you are stopped by law enforcement:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Drive as close as is safely practical to the right-hand edge or curb of
						the road, clear of any intersection, and then stop and park.</li>

						<li>Limit your movements and those of any passengers while stopping
						your vehicle.</li>

						<li>Keep your hands on the steering wheel. Passengers should keep their
						hands in plain view.</li>

						<li>Obtain your driver license and/or vehicle registration only
						when requested.</li>

						<li>Keep all vehicle doors closed as the officer approaches and remain
						in the vehicle unless requested to get out.</li>

						<li>If at night, turn on the vehicle’s interior light after stopping and before
						the officer approaches.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If enforcement action is taken that you disagree with, do not argue
					with the officer at the scene. traffic violations and traffic crimes charged
					against you are decided in court.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="47" data-name="Work/Construction Zones">

					<h4><span>Work/Construction Zones</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Driving through a maintenance, construction, or utility work zone is one
					of the most challenging tasks for drivers.</span> Following are some facts you
					should know to make the trip through or around the work area safer:</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">94</span></div>

					<ul>
						<li>Driver inattention is the number one cause of vehicle crashes in
						Oregon work zones. That’s why drivers need to pay extra attention
						when driving through a roadway work area. It’s definitely not
						“business as usual.” There may be narrow lanes, fewer lanes, or
						construction vehicles entering the roadway. Barrels, cones and
						barricades, or heavy machinery may be very close to traffic.</li>

						<li>Driving too fast is dangerous and contributes to work zone deaths
						and injuries. Driving too fast for conditions in the work area is an
						invitation for trouble. The faster you drive, the longer it takes to make
						a driving decision in case of a problem, the longer it takes to stop the
						vehicle, and the greater the injury if there is a crash.</li>

						<li>Over 40 percent of work zone crashes happen in the transition zone
						prior to the work area. That’s the time after the ROAD WORK
						AHEAD sign and before the actual work area. This is where there
						may be lanes merging or narrowing, or a detour beginning.</li>

						<li>Although workers are very vulnerable as they work close to speeding
						traffic, it’s actually drivers and their passengers who are most likely to
						be killed or injured in traffic-related work zone crashes.</li>

						<li>In Oregon, traffic fines double for all traffic offenses in maintenance,
						construction, and utility work zones, <strong>at all times and on all roads</strong>.</li>

						<li>The same rules always apply in a construction zone, whether or not
						construction workers are present.</li>

						<li>If you fail to yield right of way to a worker in a construction/work
						zone, you could be cited by law enforcement. DMV can suspend your
						driving privileges for recklessly endangering a highway worker.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Other Work Zone Safety Tips</h5>

					<ul>
						<li>Flaggers use hand signals to tell you to slow down, stop, or which
						direction to travel. Obey them as you would any other traffic control.</li>

						<li>Flashing beacons on top of highway worker vehicles are an indication
						to watch out for persons or obstructions in or near the roadway.</li>

						<li>Construction, utility, or work zones may have temporary speed zones
						posted that can change from day to day, or even by time of day. These
						are posted with speed signs.</li>

						<li>Construction or work zones may have temporary pavement markers
						instead of permanent pavement markings.</li>

						<li>White lines or temporary markers separate lanes going in the
						same direction.</li>

						<li>Yellow lines or temporary markers separate lanes going in opposite directions.</li>

				<h2><span><span class="first-sentence">Driver Safety and Responsibility</span></span></h2>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="49" data-name="Alcohol and Driving Safety">

					<h4><span>Alcohol and Driving Safety</span></h4>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/126.png">
					</figure>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Every year in Oregon, 40 percent of all traffic
					deaths are a direct result of people driving under
					the influence of alcohol or some other intoxicating
					substance.</span> If you drink alcohol, even a little, your
					chances of being in a traffic crash are much greater
					than if you did not drink <strong>any</strong> alcohol. Although new
					drivers are more at risk because of their inexperience,
					no one can drink alcohol and drive safely, even those
					who have been driving for many years.</p>

					<p>You can help save a life: Report intoxicated
					drivers anywhere in Oregon by calling (800) 24-DRUNK.</p>

					<h5>Oregon’s Implied Consent Law</h5>

					<p>This law means that by driving a motor vehicle you have implied that
					you will consent to a breath, blood, or urine test, if a police officer asks you
					to take such a test. The officer may ask you to take a test if the officer has
					arrested you for driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII).</p>

					<p>If you fail or refuse to take a test, DMV will suspend your driving
					privileges. A DMV implied consent suspension is separate from any
					suspension you may receive as a result of a DUII conviction. In addition
					to a DMV suspension and citation for DUII, a police officer may cite you
					for refusing a breath or urine test. A conviction for refusing a test may
					result in a fine of $650.</p>

					<p>If you are under 21, you will fail the test if it shows you have a blood
					alcohol content of <strong>any</strong> amount. If you are 21 or over, you will fail the test
					if your blood alcohol reading is 0.08 percent or more.</p>

					<p>Suspension lengths vary. If you are arrested for driving under the
					influence of intoxicants, and you:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Take a breath test and fail it</strong> - DMV will suspend your driving
						privileges for 90 days. If you have any prior alcohol-related entries on
						your driving record within five years, DMV will suspend your driving
						privileges for one year.</li>

						<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">97</span></div>

						<li><strong>Refuse to take a breath or urine test</strong> - DMV will suspend your
						driving privileges for one year. If you have any prior alcohol-related
						entries on your driving record within five years, DMV will suspend
						your driving privileges for three years. The suspension for refusing
						a urine test will not start until any other Implied Consent suspension
						(even from the same arrest) is over.</li>

						<li><strong>Refuse to take a blood test while receiving medical care in a health
						care facility following a motor vehicle crash</strong> - DMV will suspend
						your driving privileges for one year. If you have any prior alcohol-related
						entries on your driving record within five years, DMV will
						suspend your driving privileges for three years.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicants</h5>

					<p>You may be found guilty and convicted of driving while under the
					influence of intoxicants (DUII) if you drive a vehicle while you are under
					the influence of intoxicating liquor, a controlled substance, an inhalant, or
					any combination of these substances.</p>

					<p>You may be charged with DUII if you commit this offense any place
					open to the general public for use of motor vehicles. This includes both
					public and privately owned areas, such as shopping center parking lots,
					even if a fee is charged for use of the areas.</p>

					<p>If you are arrested and take an implied consent test, a reading of 0.08
					percent or more is enough to establish that you were under the influence
					of intoxicants. If a chemical test is not taken or you had a blood alcohol
					reading of less than 0.08 percent, you still may be convicted if the police
					have enough evidence to convince the judge or jury that you were driving
					under the influence of intoxicants.</p>

					<h5>Diversion Agreement</h5>

					<p>If you are cited for DUII and you have not been convicted of a crime
					involving the use of a motor vehicle nor have any other alcohol-related
					actions on your record in the past 15 years, and the court agrees, you may
					be able to enter a diversion agreement. If you complete the diversion
					requirements, which include fines, treatment, ignition interlock device,
					etc., you will not have a conviction for DUII on your driving record. The
					diversion agreement will show on your record.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">98</span></div>

					<p>The court cannot offer you diversion if you have a commercial driver
					license or the offense occurred in a commercial motor vehicle.</p>

					<h5>DUII Conviction</h5>

					<p>If you are convicted of DUII:</p>

					<ul>
						 <li><strong>First Conviction</strong> - Mandatory suspension of your driving privilege
						 for one year.</li>

						 <li><strong>Second Conviction</strong> - Mandatory suspension of your driving privilege
						 for three years, if the offense occurred within five years of another
						 DUII conviction.</li>

						 <li><strong>Third or Subsequent Conviction</strong> - Permanent revocation of your
						 driving privilege.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>A fourth or subsequent DUII conviction is a felony offense, if the
					offense takes place within ten years of three other DUII convictions.</p>

					<p>If you are under 18 years of age and you are convicted of DUII, DMV
					will suspend your driving privileges until you are 18 years old or until you
					are eligible for reinstatement, whichever comes later.</p>

					<p>When a DUII suspension ends, you must meet several reinstatement
					requirements before you can obtain a valid driver license. These
					requirements include filing proof of future financial responsibility for
					three years, installing an ignition interlock device (IID) in your vehicle
					for one year, (two years for a second or subsequent DUII conviction), and
					paying a reinstatement fee.</p>

					<h5>Oregon’s Open Container Law</h5>

					<p>If you drink any alcohol or have an open bottle or other container with
					any alcohol in it while you are in a motor vehicle on any road or highway,
					you are breaking the law.</p>

					<p>Any open bottles, cans, or other containers of beer, wine, or other alcohol
					can be stored in the trunk or in the living quarters of a camper or motor home.</p>

					<h5>Drugs and Inhalants</h5>

					<p>A court can order suspension of your driving privileges for six months
					for certain drug offenses. The drug offense does not have to involve a
					motor vehicle. No hardship permit will be allowed during the suspension.</p>

					<p>One in four persons reportedly take some kind of drug every day,
					primarily over-the-counter, legal drugs. Almost any drug can affect your
					driving skills.</p>

					<p>Alcohol is the most common drug that drivers use to become
					intoxicated. “Intoxicants” also includes a wide range of inhalants and</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">99</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">drugs, both legal and illegal. You may be arrested for driving under the
					influence of these drugs and inhalants, the same as for alcohol.</p>

					<p>Here are some facts you need to know:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Most drugs you take for headaches, colds, hay fever, allergies, or to
						calm your nerves can make you drowsy. This can affect your ability to
						control a vehicle.</li>

						<li>Marijuana and alcohol are frequently found in combination in
						the blood of drivers, especially young drivers, who are killed in
						traffic crashes.</li>

						<li>An inhalant is any vapor-releasing substance, such as paint or glue,
						that can cause intoxication.</li>

						<li>Drugs or inhalants may have unexpected effects, if taken together or
						with alcohol.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If the label on a drug warns that it may cause drowsiness or dizziness,
					you should not drive after taking it.</p>

					<h5>Losing the Privilege to Apply for a Provisional License</h5>

					<p>If you are 13-20 years of age, possession, use or abuse of alcohol will
					affect your driving privileges. In addition, if you are 13-17 years of age,
					possession, manufacture, delivery, or use of any controlled substance will
					also affect your driving privileges. The judge may order DMV to suspend
					your driving privileges if you are convicted of being illegally involved
					with alcohol or drugs. You do not have to be driving or in a motor vehicle
					for this law to apply.</p>

					<p>A first order will be for one year or until you reach age 17, whichever
					is longer. A second order will be for one year or until you reach age 18,
					whichever is longer. If you are 18-20 years of age, the order will be for
					one year.</p>

					<p>The judge may review the order and withdraw it after 90 days on the first
					offense. If the offense involved controlled substances, the judge cannot
					withdraw the order until after six months. If the order is for your second or
					subsequent offense, the judge cannot withdraw the order until after one year.
					</p>

					<h5>Leave the Driving to Someone Else</h5>

					<p>If you drive after you have been drinking or used drugs, it may get you
					into all kinds of trouble with police, courts, and DMV. The best way to
					avoid this trouble is to let someone who does not drink and does not use
					drugs do the driving. Or you may decide to use public transportation to
					get home. A cab ride home is a lot cheaper than a fine and all the other
					costs involved in an arrest or conviction for DUII, including suspension</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">100</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">of your driving privileges. One DUII conviction can cost you thousands
					of dollars.</p>

					<h5>Step In to Protect Your Friends</h5>

					<p>People who have had too much to drink are unable to make responsible
					decisions. It is up to others to step in and keep them from taking too
					great a risk. No one wants to do this—it’s uncomfortable, embarrassing,
					and you are rarely thanked for your efforts at the time. However, the
					alternatives are often worse.</p>

					<p>While you may not be thanked at the time, you will never have to say,
					“If only I had...”</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="50" data-name="Traffic Crashes and Insurance Requirements">

					<h4><span>Traffic Crashes and Insurance Requirements</span></h4>

					<h5>Accidents</h5>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">The common term for crashes, wrecks, and collisions is “accidents.”</span>
					However, the word “accident” is misleading. If you crash because you
					were distracted, tired, or not driving defensively, it is a preventable crash,
					not an accident. Because true accidents are rare, this manual generally
					uses the words crash, collision, or wreck.
					</p>

					<h5>Your Responsibilities</h5>

					<p>If you have a traffic crash or collision, you <strong>must</strong>:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Stop at once.</strong> If there are no injuries and vehicles can be safely
						moved, they should be moved out of travel lanes as soon as possible.
						Information can be exchanged away from the actual crash scene.
						Needlessly blocking or endangering other traffic can result in
						secondary crashes.</li>

						<li><strong>Render aid.</strong> Give any reasonable assistance to injured persons.
						Injured people should never be moved carelessly. In many cases, they
						should not be moved at all until it is possible to get an ambulance
						or someone trained in first aid to the scene. If a driver is involved in
						an accident in which a person is killed or rendered unconscious, the
						driver is required to remain at the scene of the crash until a police
						officer arrives. Failure to do so is classified and punishable as a “hit
						and run.” Hit and run is a serious traffic crime. Conviction will mean
						your driving privileges will be revoked or suspended.</li>

						<li><strong>Exchange information.</strong> Provide your name, address, driver
						license number, license plate number of your vehicle, and your
						insurance information to the other driver, passengers, or any
						injured pedestrian involved.</li>

						<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">101</span></div>

						<li>
							<strong>File a report.</strong> Oregon law requires you to fi le an accident report with
							DMV if:

							<ul>
								<li>Damage to the vehicle you were driving is over $1,500;</li>

								<li>Damage to property other than a vehicle is over $1,500;</li>

								<li>Damage to any vehicle is greater than $1,500 and any vehicle is
								towed from the scene due to damage from the crash;</li>

								<li>There is injury or death resulting from the crash;</li>

								<li>You are the owner of a vehicle involved in a reportable crash and
								the driver fails to report the crash.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>You must make the report within <strong>72 hours</strong>. If you do not report a crash
					when required to do so, your driving privileges will be suspended.</p>

					<h5>Removing Your Vehicle from a Crash Site</h5>

					<p>If you are involved in a crash or collision on a roadway, you have no
					injury, and your vehicle is operable, <strong>move your vehicle off the roadway</strong>
					to a nearby location if it is safe to do so. This helps to minimize the
					obstruction of traffic and you will avoid being cited for failure to remove
					your motor vehicle.</p>

					<h5>Reporting Crashes</h5>

					<p><strong>A police report does not replace your requirement to file a personal
					report with DMV</strong>. You must fill out an Oregon traffic Accident and
					Insurance Report and return it to DMV, even if a police officer files a report.
					You can obtain the report online at <span class="url">www.odot.state.or.us/forms/dmv/32.pdf</span> or
					from any DMV office. Be as accurate as you can. Give as much information
					as you can about where, when, and how the crash happened.</p>

					<p>If you are the driver or owner of a vehicle in a crash that must be
					reported, your report must show the name of your liability insurance
					company and the policy number. The insurance coverage reported is
					checked by DMV with the insurance company shown on the report.</p>

					<p>If you did not have liability insurance at the time of the crash, your
					driving privileges will be suspended for one year. After that, you will be
					under the future financial responsibility law for three years (See <em>Page 104</em>).
					A suspension and insurance filing is required, even if you were not at fault
					in the crash. The same applies if DMV receives the information from an
					insurance company or agent. Insurance companies must tell DMV about
					any crash where they have reason to believe a driver is uninsured. This
					law applies even if the damage is $1,500 or less.</p>


					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">102</span></div>

					<h5>Unattended Vehicles</h5>

					<p>If you hit an unoccupied vehicle, try to find the owner. If you cannot
					find the owner, leave a note that identifies you as the person who hit the
					unattended vehicle and how to contact you. By law you are required to
					write your name and address on the note, along with a brief description of
					what happened. If you damage property other than a motor vehicle, you
					also must try to find the owner or someone in charge to report the damage.</p>

					<h5>Mandatory Insurance</h5>

					<p>Nationwide, uninsured drivers cause millions of dollars in damage
					each year. This includes not only damage to the vehicles involved, but
					also medical care needed for those people who are injured or killed in
					those crashes.</p>

					<p>Oregon law requires every driver to insure their vehicles by at least
					these minimum amounts:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><span class="italic">Bodily Injury and Property Damage</span><br/>
						$25,000 per person; $50,000 per accident for bodily injury to others;
						and $20,000 per accident for damage to the property of others.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Oregon law also requires every motor vehicle liability policy to provide:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><span class="italic">Personal Injury Protection</span><br/>
						$15,000 per person for reasonable and necessary expenses one year
						after an accident, for medical, dental, and other services needed due to
						the accident. Motorcycles are excluded.</li>

						<li><span class="italic">Uninsured Motorist Coverage</span><br/>
						$25,000 per person; $50,000 per accident for bodily injury.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Driving without liability insurance could result in fines, suspension of
					your driving privileges, and in some areas your vehicle could be towed. If
					your vehicle is towed, you are also subject to towing and storage fees.</p>

					<p>When you purchase a vehicle, contact your insurance company before
					you drive it anywhere.</p>

					<h5>Ensuring Compliance</h5>

					<p>Insurance companies are required by law to report to DMV when they
					issue a new policy or when a person or the insurer cancels or fails to
					renew a policy. This information is accessible to law enforcement officers
					and may be used as reasonable grounds to believe a person is driving an
					uninsured vehicle. You are required by law to carry insurance information
					in your vehicle as proof that you have insurance.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">103</span></div>

					<p>Other insurance information you should know:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>You must provide the name of your insurance company and policy
						number each time you register a motor vehicle. You also must
						certify that you will comply with Oregon’s motor vehicle insurance
						requirements as long as a vehicle is registered in your name.</li>

						<li>DMV checks insurance compliance by regularly selecting registered
						vehicles and sending the owner(s) a mandatory insurance verification
						card. You must provide the name of your insurance company and
						policy number if you receive a mandatory insurance verification
						card from DMV. DMV verifies the information you provide with the
						insurance company you list. If you do not provide this information, or
						if the insurance company you listed denies you have coverage, DMV
						will suspend your driving privileges.</li>

						<li>It is a misdemeanor offense to falsify insurance coverage information.
						If found guilty, you may be fined, given a jail sentence, or both.</li>

						<li>If you violate insurance requirements, Oregon’s <strong>future financial
						responsibility</strong> law means you will have to maintain proof of future
						financial responsibility with DMV for three years. If you cancel it or
						let it lapse by not paying the premium, your driving privileges will be
						suspended. There are several reasons why you may be subject to this
						law, such as when you do not have the insurance you claim to have on
						your vehicle registration, if you do not have insurance at the time of
						an accident, or if a judge convicts you of driving uninsured or a traffic
						crime such as DUII.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>An insurance company can make a financial responsibility filing for
					you, if it is needed. The only way your insurance company may do this is
					to send an SR22 insurance certificate to DMV. Your insurance must cover
					all vehicles operated by you and/or registered in your name.</p>

					<p>If your driving privileges have been suspended because you did not file
					proof of future financial responsibility, and you later get insurance, be sure
					you do not drive until the proof of future financial responsibility is on file
					with DMV and your driving privileges have been reinstated.</p>

					<h5>Court Judgments</h5>

					<p>If you damage property or cause injury to someone in a crash on public
					or private property, the property owner or injured person may go to court
					to get a judgment against you. If the court notifies DMV that a judgment
					has not been satisfied within 60 days, your driving privileges will be
					suspended. You must satisfy the judgment through the court.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="51" data-name="Traffic Violations and License Suspensions">

					<h4><span>Traffic Violations and License Suspensions</span></h4>

					<h5>Traffic Violations</h5>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">A traffic violation is an offense for not obeying a rule of the road,
					driver licensing or registration law, or vehicle equipment law.</span> You will
					be required to pay a fine if you plead guilty, no contest, or if a judge
					convicts you.</p>

					<h5>Traffic Crimes</h5>

					<p>Some traffic offenses are so serious that, if you break these laws, you are
					charged with traffic crimes.</p>

					<p>You do not need to be driving on a public highway to be charged with
					these offenses. You may be charged in areas or premises open to the general
					public for use of motor vehicles, such as parking lots on either public or
					private property. You also may be charged with these offenses in some off-road
					areas.</p>

					<p>Examples of traffic crimes are: driving while under the influence
					of intoxicants, failure to perform the duties of a driver involved in an
					accident, reckless driving, fleeing or trying to elude a police officer, and
					some driving while suspended or revoked charges.</p>

					<h5>Failure to Appear / Failure to Comply</h5>

					<p>A judge may order DMV to suspend your driving privileges if you
					fail to appear in court or fail to pay a traffic fine in Oregon or another
					jurisdiction. Your privileges will be suspended until the judge notifies
					DMV that the case has been cleared with the court or until 10 years have
					elapsed from the date the suspension begins, whichever comes first.</p>

					<h5>Suspensions and Revocations</h5>

					<p>If a judge suspends or revokes your driving privileges, you may get a
					suspension or revocation order in court. The court will confiscate your
					driver license and return it to DMV.</p>

					<p>If DMV suspends or revokes your driving privileges, DMV will send a
					notice to the address on your driving record. If you have a license in your
					possession, you must return it to DMV when the suspension begins.</p>

					<p>After the suspension or revocation begins, you may not drive any motor
					vehicle on highways or premises open to the public.</p>

					<h5>Reinstatement Fees</h5>

					<p>There is a $75 reinstatement fee to restore driving privileges that have
					been revoked or suspended. You also must pay a reinstatement fee for</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">105</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">suspended identification cards. The reinstatement fee is separate from any
					DMV licensing or replacement fee.</p>

					<h5>Use of False Identification by Minors</h5>

					<p>A minor who uses a false driver license, permit, or other identifi cation
					to buy alcohol may be required to perform community service, and can
					receive up to a one-year suspension of driving privileges. These penalties
					are in addition to any other penalties required by law.</p>

					<h5>Withdrawal of Parental Consent for a License or Permit</h5>

					<p>The parent or legal guardian who signed the driver license application
					for an applicant under the age of 18 may withdraw consent for the child
					to have a permit or license at any time, until the child turns age 18.
					DMV will cancel the child’s license or permit until a parent or legal
					guardian again consents to the child having a permit or license, or until
					the child reaches 18 years of age, becomes emancipated, or is married. A
					withdrawal of consent must be done in writing.</p>

					<h5>Suspensions for Students</h5>

					<p>Your driving privileges may be suspended if you are at least 15 years of
					age and are expelled from school for bringing a weapon to school. Your
					driving privileges may also be suspended if you are suspended twice or
					expelled twice for:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Assaulting or menacing a school employee or student.</li>

						<li>Willful damage or injury to school property.</li>

						<li>Use of threats, intimidation, harassment, or coercion against a
						school employee or student.</li>

						<li>Possessing, using, delivering, or being under the influence of any
						controlled substance on school property or at a school sponsored
						activity, function, or event.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>A first offense will result in a suspension of up to one year. A second
					offense will result in suspension until your twenty-first birthday.</p>

					<p>If you are 15-17 years old, you cannot have unexcused absences for
					more than 10 consecutive school days or 15 school days total during a
					single semester. The superintendent or school board may ask DMV to
					suspend your driving privileges.</p>

					<h5>Suspension for Tobacco Offenses</h5>

					<p>It is illegal to purchase or attempt to purchase tobacco products if you
					are under 18 years old. DMV will suspend your driving privileges if you
					are under 18 years old and you are convicted of a second offense for
					purchasing or attempting to purchase tobacco products.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">106</span></div>

					<h5>Failure to Pay Child Support</h5>

					<p>If you are either three months or $2,500 behind in child support payments,
					the Division of Child Support or a district attorney may ask DMV to
					suspend your driving privileges. This type of suspension remains in effect
					until the Division of Child Support or a district attorney authorizes DMV to
					reinstate your driving privileges and you pay a reinstatement fee.</p>

					<h5>Driver Improvement Program</h5>

					<p>The purpose of the Driver Improvement Program is to promote traffic
					safety—especially the reduction of traffic convictions and accidents. The
					program is designed for both provisional (under 18 years old) and
					adult drivers.</p>

					<p><strong>Here’s what happens to drivers <span class="italic">under</span> 18</strong> - If you have two
					convictions, two accidents, or a combination of one conviction and one
					accident, before your 18th birthday, DMV will restrict your driving
					privileges for 90 days to drive only for work purposes with no passengers
					except your parent, stepparent, or guardian. These restrictions are
					in addition to the restrictions placed on a driver in the first year of a
					provisional license.</p>

					<p>If you get <strong>another</strong> conviction or accident, DMV will suspend your
					driving privileges for six months, even if you turn 18 years of age during
					the suspension period.</p>

					<p><strong>Here’s what happens to drivers <span class="italic">18 years or older</span></strong> - If you have three
					convictions, three preventable accidents, or a combination that totals
					three, in an 18-month period, DMV will restrict your driving privileges
					for 30 days. The restriction will not allow you to drive between midnight
					and 5 a.m., unless driving for work purposes.</p>

					<p>If you have four convictions, four preventable accidents, or a
					combination that totals four in a 24–month period, DMV will suspend
					your driving privileges for 30 days.</p>

					<p>You can view listings of the traffic violations that count towards the
					Driver Improvement Program at <span class="url">www.OregonDMV.com</span> under Driver and
					ID info.</p>

					<h5>Habitual Traffic Offenders</h5>

					<p>Laws were established to revoke the driving privileges of individuals
					who are convicted of offenses that are either so severe or in such quantity
					that those individuals are determined to be “habitual offenders.”</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">107</span></div>

					<p>DMV will revoke your driving privileges for five years if you are
					convicted of three or more traffic crimes or 20 or more traffic violations
					within a five year period.</p>

					<p>You can view the traffic crimes and a listing of the traffic violations
					that lead to revocation of your driving privileges as a habitual offender at
					<span class="url">www.OregonDMV.com</span>.</p>

					<h5>Re-evaluations</h5>

					<p>DMV may require any driver to come in for a re-evaluation if there is
					reason to question the driver’s ability to drive safely. DMV will suspend
					the person’s driving privilege if the person does not take the test(s) or fails
					to pass the test(s).</p>

					<h5>Hardship and Probationary Permits</h5>

					<p>For some suspensions of driving privileges, you may be able to get a
					hardship permit or a probationary permit if DMV revokes your driving
					privilege as a habitual traffic offender. Hardship and probationary permits
					allow you to drive to and from work, on the job, to seek employment,
					or to take part in an alcohol or drug rehabilitation program. The permits
					do not allow you to operate commercial motor vehicles. There may be
					a waiting period that must pass before you are eligible for a hardship or
					probationary permit.</p>

					<p>No hardship or probationary permit is available if your driving privileges
					are revoked for a traffic crime.</p>

					<h5>Driver Records</h5>

					<p>Your driving record includes reports of convictions for traffic violations
					and crimes, as well as suspensions, revocations, and cancellations of your
					driving privileges and other notations that may relate to these entries. It
					also notes crashes in which you were the driver, regardless of whether
					you were at fault. This record is very important to you. It helps decide
					how much your insurance will cost. It may also keep you from getting or
					keeping a job. It probably will help a judge decide how much to fine you
					for violating a traffic law, and, in some cases, it may cause you to have
					your driving privileges suspended, revoked, or restricted.</p>

				<h1>Section 7</h1>

				<h2><span>Vehicle Equipment</span></h2>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">A vehicle that is not in good condition is a road hazard and should not
				be driven or moved.</span> If you think there is a problem with your vehicle,
				you should have it fixed right away. If you don’t and the problem causes
				or contributes to a death, a grand jury or district attorney may charge you
				with criminally negligent homicide.</p>

				<p>Some kinds of safety equipment, such as lights, are needed on all types
				of motor vehicles. Other equipment is prohibited, or its use is limited to
				certain types of vehicles such as police vehicles and fire trucks. Commercial
				trucks, buses, and combinations of vehicles must have more equipment
				than passenger cars. Motorcycles have different equipment requirements.
				Information in this section focuses on passenger vehicles.</p>

				<p>All required equipment must be in good working condition. A police
				officer who thinks a vehicle is unsafe may stop the vehicle to check its
				condition and equipment.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="53" data-name="Mandatory Vehicle Equipment">

					<h4><span>Mandatory Vehicle Equipment</span></h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">The following equipment is required for the legal operation of your vehicle
					on Oregon roadways and to take a drive test at a DMV office.</span></p>

					<figure>
						<img class="floatright" src="/contents/dmv/images/127.png">
					</figure>

					<h5>Safety Belts</h5>

					<p>If your vehicle was manufactured with safety belts, you
					must maintain them in good working condition for all
					appropriate seating positions. (See <em>Page 70</em> for additional
					information on requirements and proper use.)</p>

					<h5>Headlights</h5>

					<p>Two white headlights are required, at least one on each
					side of the front of the vehicle. Colors other than white are
					not allowed. Your headlights must also be aimed correctly. Some headlights
					may make it hard for oncoming drivers to see if they are not aimed
					correctly. Your vehicle owner’s manual may contain information on how to
					correctly aim headlights. All headlights must meet federal safety standards.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">109</span></div>

					<h5>Taillights</h5>

					<p>A vehicle must have two red taillights, one on each side of the vehicle,
					visible from 500 feet to the rear.</p>

					<h5>Registration Plate Lights</h5>

					<p>Every vehicle must have at least one white rear license plate light. This
					light must make the rear registration plate clearly legible from a distance
					of 50 feet to the rear of the vehicle.</p>

					<h5>Rear Reflectors</h5>

					<p>Two red reflectors are required on the rear of every vehicle. One reflector
					must be on each side of the vehicle, either as part of the taillights or separate.</p>

					<h5>Brake Lights</h5>

					<p>Two red brake lights are required. They must be mounted on the rear of
					the vehicle and as far apart as possible. The brake lights must be visible
					from 500 feet in normal daylight.</p>

					<h5>Turn Signals</h5>

					<p>Every vehicle must have right and left turn signal lights on the front and
					rear. Turn signal lights on the front may be amber or white. On the rear,
					these signals may be red, amber, or yellow. The signals must be visible
					from 500 feet.</p>

					<h5>Trailer Lighting</h5>

					<p>All trailers must have taillights, brake lights, turn signals, rear red
					reflectors, and a license plate light (if a license plate is required). Larger
					trailers require more lighting equipment and reflectors depending upon
					their size.</p>

					<h5>Registration Plates</h5>

					<p>If only one registration plate is required for your vehicle, such as a
					motorcycle or trailer, you must display this plate on the rear of the vehicle.</p>

					<p>If your vehicle is required to have two registration plates, such as a
					passenger car or truck, a plate must be displayed on both the front and rear
					of the vehicle.</p>

					<h5>Brakes</h5>

					<p>Every vehicle except motorcycles and mopeds must have two separate
					brake systems in good working order. Each system must be capable
					of applying brakes. Brakes on any vehicle must be adequate to control
					movement of, and to stop and hold, the vehicle or the combination of vehicles.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">110</span></div>

					<h5>Tires</h5>

					<p>For good traction, vehicle tires should have a minimum of 2/32 inch of
					tread. It is against the law to drive a vehicle on any tire that has body ply or
					belt material exposed or any tire that shows tread or sidewall separation.</p>

					<h5>Exhaust System</h5>

					<p>A vehicle must have an exhaust system that is in good working order
					and in constant operation. It must meet noise and emission standards set
					by the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). Your vehicle must
					not be driven if it causes more noise than is reasonably needed for good
					operation. If your vehicle produces too many pollutants, you are breaking
					the law. If your vehicle is located in the Portland or Medford area you will
					need to pass a DEQ inspection.</p>

					<h5>Windows and Windshield</h5>

					<p>You should keep the windshield and other windows clean (both inside
					and outside) so you have good visibility. Bright sun or headlights on dirty
					windows make it harder to see. If you smoke in the vehicle, a film will build
					up on the windows, so you need to clean the inside of the windows frequently.</p>

					<p>No sign, poster, one-way glass, adhesive film, or glaze application is
					allowed on the windshield, the windows forward of or on either side of
					the driver’s seat, or the rear window, if the material prohibits or impairs
					the ability to see into or out of the vehicle.</p>

					<p>Remember: Most of what you do in driving is a reaction to what you
					see, so you should be sure you have a clear view out of the vehicle.</p>

					<h5>Windshield Wipers</h5>

					<p>Good working wipers are required. They are important to driving safely.</p>

					<h5>Rearview Mirror</h5>

					<p>The driver must be able to see at least 200 feet behind the vehicle at
					all times, and with all loads, on a straight, level road. If a trailer or load
					obstructs the rear view, then outside rearview mirrors on each side of the
					motor vehicle are required. These mirrors need to be extended beyond the
					width of the trailer or load so the driver can see 200 feet behind the vehicle.</p>

					<h5>Horns and Sirens</h5>

					<p>A vehicle must have a working horn you can hear from 200 feet away.
					Sirens or similar devices may be used only on authorized emergency vehicles.</p>

					<h5>Fenders and Mudguards</h5>

					<p>Most motor vehicles and trailers must have adequate fenders or mudguards
					behind all wheels. The exact requirements vary with the type of vehicle.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">111</span></div>

					<h5>Minimum Clearance</h5>

					<p>No part of a passenger vehicle can have less clearance from the road
					than the lowest part of the rim of any wheel.</p>

					<h5>Special Vehicle Lighting</h5>

					<p>Some vehicles are exempt from most lighting requirements that others must
					meet. For example, antique vehicles have only the types of lights required
					when they were manufactured. Vehicles not required to have most types of
					lights must use at least one white light on the front and have at least one red
					light on the rear of the vehicle if you use the vehicles on streets and highways
					from sunset to sunrise, or when visibility is limited. This lighting requirement
					includes animal-drawn vehicles, farm tractors, and road machinery.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="54" data-name="Optional Vehicle Equipment">

					<h4><span>Optional Vehicle Equipment</span></h4>

					<h5>Spotlight</h5>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">A motor vehicle may be equipped with one spotlight.</span> When used, it
					must be aimed toward the right side of the road when meeting other
					vehicles. The beam must strike the road not more than 100 feet ahead of
					the vehicle on which it is mounted.</p>

					<h5>Backup Lights</h5>

					<p>A vehicle may be equipped with white backup lights. Backup lights can
					only be lit when your vehicle is in reverse.</p>

					<h5>Fog Lights</h5>

					<p>A vehicle may be equipped with fog lights. The lights may be white or
					amber and the beam must strike the road not more than 75 feet ahead of
					the vehicle on which it is mounted. These lights are to be used in the same
					manner as high beam headlights, unless they are less than 300 candlepower.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="55" data-name="Restricted Lights and Equipment">

					<h4><span>Restricted Lights and Equipment</span></h4>

					<h5>Light and Registration Plate Covers</h5>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Do not place covers over your registration plates or on any required
					vehicle light.</span> Covers on vehicle lights, including brake lights and turn
					signals, are not legal if the cover is on while you are required to use the
					lights. Registration plate covers, clear or tinted, are not legal in Oregon if
					it makes the plate unreadable or if it alters the appearance of the plate.</p>

					<h5>Red Lights</h5>

					<p>Red lights or flashing red lights that can be seen from the front are to be
					used only on fire department vehicles, police vehicles, ambulances, school</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">112</span></div>

					<p class="not-indented">buses, worker transportation buses, church buses, vehicles escorting
					funeral processions, tow vehicles, and some ODOT emergency vehicles.</p>

					<h5>Amber Lights</h5>

					<p>Amber lights may be used on police vehicles, fire department
					emergency response vehicles, school buses, vehicles used in road
					construction or repair, mail delivery vehicles, pilot vehicles, commercial
					vehicles, public utility vehicles, worker transportation buses, and church
					buses as a pre-warning of a stop ahead.</p>

					<p>Tow vehicles connecting to or servicing a disabled vehicle may use
					either red or amber warning lights.</p>

					<h5>Blue Lights</h5>

					<p>Blue lights, steady or flashing, are permitted only on police vehicles or
					fire department emergency response vehicles.</p>

					<h5>Green Lights</h5>

					<p>Fire vehicles operating as the command post in emergency incidents
					may use a flashing or revolving green light. Green lights may be used on
					the rear-mounted tricolor lighting system.</p>

					<h5>Check Before You Buy</h5>

					<p>Some aftermarket (custom) accessories and lighting equipment may not
					be legal in Oregon. Be sure to check equipment for markings showing
					the equipment is legal. If the aftermarket accessory or equipment has the
					following marking or information on the product, they are most likely not
					legal for street use in Oregon:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>For Off-Road Use Only.</li>

						<li>For Show Use Only.</li>

						<li>Check local laws and ordinances for use.</li>

						<li>DOT or SAE Certified (neither DOT nor SAE certify products;
						however, manufacturers can certify that their products meet these
						federal standards).</li>
					</ul>

					as lighting, tinted windows, trailer equipment, mud fl aps, and other
					information, visit ODOT’s Transportation Safety Division web site at:
