					<h3>Abstract</h3>

					<p class="abstract"><span class="first-sentence">It will be essential for postsecondary institutions to come up with new ways of providing service delivery to returning
					veterans with disabilities who will bring with them an entirely new perspective on what it means to have
					a disability.</span> This emerging disability group will bring with them life experiences that are very unique and vastly
					different than what has previously been the norm. Postsecondary institutions will be challenged by incoming
					veterans with disabilities with expectations largely shaped by the military culture. In order to address the unique
					educational needs of veterans with disabilities, multiple levels of collaboration will be necessary. This article will
					provide information on current collaborative approaches being successfully utilized by postsecondary institutions
					involving Disabled Student Services (DSS) and Veterans Service Officer (VSO), campus programs, and community
					agencies supporting military veterans.</p>

						<span class="pageNumber" style="color:white;">2</span>
					</div>

					<p>The number of veterans pursuing a postsecondary
					education is expected to significantly increase (Perry,
					2009). This student group will include veterans with
					disabilities, and may bring expectations and needs
					which may be different then what has been experienced
					with prior cohorts of students with disabilities. To
					address the unique needs of this disability group, a new
					approach to service delivery is required.</p>

					<p>One goal of academia may be the collaborative
					exchange of ideas. However, actual practice within
					academia may fall short of an entirely open collaboration
					as territorial boundaries between disciplines are
					drawn (Lovett, 2006). Differing frames of reference,
					competing finances, and the career aspirations of
					individuals may also decrease collaboration. Despite the
					common goal to support successful student scholarship,
					academic student support services, unfortunately, fall
					victim to similar pitfalls (Brown, 2009). Financial
					aid, matriculation, student conduct, student health
					services, disability services, veteran services, or any
					of the myriad of support services may exist in "silos"
					disconnected from one another, with diminished ability
					to achieve truly collaborative support of students,
					especially students with unique needs. The needs of
					active duty and returning veterans transitioning from
					military service to academic life, particularly with
					injuries and functional limitations that affect their
					participation in college, call for a conscious effort to
					permeate boundaries between college support services
					and, additionally, collaboration with organizations
					outside academia.</p>

					<p>This paper seeks to describe ways support
					services practitioners may collaborate with a variety
					of individuals and groups to meet the needs of
					military students with disability-related functional
					limitations transitioning to college. Three levels of
					collaborative work will be outlined: (a) collaboration
					between Disabled Student Services (DSS) and Veterans
					Service Officer (VSO); (b) collaboration within the
					organizational structure of the academic institution;
					and (c) collaboration with the community at large. The
					signature injury of current military actions, traumatic
					brain injury (TBI), also requires links to federal and
					local initiatives, which will be described.</p>

					<h4>Students Transitioning from the Military to College</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Descriptions of military culture may be debated
					but the prevailing view is steeped in the traditions
					and practices of aggressive masculinity, unhindered
					aggressiveness (Titunik, 2008).</span> Military service personnel have been trained to be warriors, ready at
					all times for duty. The term <em>disabled</em> is imbued with
					a connotation of <em>not fit</em>, weak, unable to participate
					or perform. Not surprisingly, returning veterans with
					physical and/or psychological injuries do not typically
					identify themselves as someone who would qualify
					to receive support and reasonable accommodations
					through a DSS program.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">2</div>
					<div class="pagebreak">
						<span class="pageNumber" style="color:white;">3</span>
					</div>

					<p>The standard method for students who are veterans,
					both injured and uninjured, to establish enrollment
					certification for educational benefits earned during
					active service is through each campus' VSO (US
					Department of Veterans Affairs, 2009). The degree to
					which the VSO engages with individual students will
					vary from college to college. For example, the VSO
					might be assigned to roles other than working with
					veterans, active duty personnel, or dependents. The
					VSO may be a clerk performing multiple duties in
					the Admissions department or may be a professional
					assigned solely to veteran issues, such as an academic
					advisement counselor with unique training and
					experience with veteran affairs.</p>

					<p>To support those returning with psychological
					and/or physical injuries, such as post traumatic stress
					disorder (PTSD), TBI, or orthopedic injuries, DSS
					providers must establish a collaborative relationship
					with their VSO. The initial relationship may be one of
					exchanging information. For example, the VSO might
					share military terminology and culture with the DSS
					provider, while the DSS personnel might describe the
					signs and symptoms of PTSD or TBI. Each has much
					information to offer to the other, because in general,
					VSO's know little about the types of services and
					accommodations available through a DSS program.
					Likewise, DSS specialists know little about military
					life, educational benefits through the Montgomery
					GI Bill, redeployment orders, and training credits. A
					strong working relationship is necessary to bridge the
					gap between students' reluctance to seek DSS services
					and the benefits of managing their functional limitations
					with appropriate accommodations and support. The
					relationship can also prepare the DSS specialist to
					provide a climate of understanding for these students,
					a basic building block for effective support.</p>

					<p>As Church (2008) noted, "nondisclosure of
					limitations is a huge issue" (p. 4) in part because
					students do not want to be labeled as disabled with the
					same potential for disability stigmatization in society.
					The non-disclosure of a student's disability has always
					been ingrained in the everyday work of DSS providers.
					However, the concerns many veterans with disabilities
					have regarding disclosure of their disability status are
					of particular concern. It is likely that many veterans
					will be utilizing their college education to start new
					careers in fields such as security and law enforcement
					and, thereby, leveraging their military training into
					civilian life. These are fields with background checks
					unforgiving of any disability history.</p>

					<p>Each veteran with a disability will need to be
					reassured that we can provide them with an extremely
					high level of confidentiality and that this can be
					demonstrated to them by explaining procedures for
					the release of disability documentation and how such
					information is appropriately stored. This is often the
					first step of many towards earning the ultimate trust
					of a veteran with a disability. DSS providers would be
					wise in not promising more than they can deliver to a
					veteran and making sure that confidentiality protocols
					are followed closely.</p>

					<p>Military transition students feel most comfortable
					with each other. Peer support is particularly valued
					because military training and culture has the unit of
					individuals relying on one another for safety and,
					literally, for life and limb when in combat. DSS
					personnel must be aware that a lack of trust or a history
					of success and respectful support with service providers
					will be readily shared within the peer student-veteran
					networks.</p>

				<section class="section" data-number="2" data-name="Collaboration within the Academic Institution">

					<h4>Collaboration within the Academic Institution</h4>

					<p><em>Institution-wide committees</em>. <span class="first-sentence">Optimizing the
					success of students who have functional limitations
					transitioning from the military is an institutional
					responsibility.</span> A unified approach enlisting all
					components of the institution can be facilitated through
					a campus-wide collaboration directed by the highest
					administrative authority, such as the college president
					and/or the academic senate. This directive may include
					the formation of an interdepartmental committee
					charged with creating a campus climate conducive to
					the success of all military transition students including
					those with disabilities/injuries.</p>

					<p>At California State University, San Marcos
					(CSUSM) such a committee is chaired by the Vice
					President for Student Affairs and is comprised of
					representatives from Counseling, Disabled Student
					Services, Admissions, Career Services, Veterans Office,
					faculty, students, and from the veteran's community.
					Crucial to gaining the trust of the veteran students at
					CSUSM was the establishment of obtainable short
					and long term goals. Some goals, such as priority
					registration for active duty personnel and veterans, may
					be readily achievable and at little cost to the institution.
					Other goals, such as the development of a Veterans
					Center with staff and facility expenses, required longterm
					planning and fund raising.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">3</div>
					<div class="pagebreak">
						<span class="pageNumber" style="color:white;">4</span>
					</div>

					<p><em>Student groups and voices</em>. Current and past
					student veterans may be a source of information about
					the unique barriers to success on a specific college
					campus. In 2008 a panel of college students who are
					veterans with disabilities presented their experiences to
					the California Association of Postsecondary Education
					and Disability Convention (CAPED; Panelists, 2008).
					The students stated that the attitudes of other students
					and faculty were the greatest barriers to becoming part
					of the academic community. They described instances of
					other students asking inappropriate questions about their
					military service, accusations about their role in military
					engagements, and insensitive statements by professors
					in class about the military and its missions.</p>

					<p>Student voices are a powerful method for ensuring
					that the campus climate is welcoming and productive
					for military transition students. A national resource
					is Student Veterans of America (SVA), a coalition of
					student veterans groups from college campuses across
					the United States. Founded in January 2008, SVA works
					to develop new student groups, coordinate between
					existing student groups, and advocate on behalf
					of student veterans at the local, state, and national
					level. Representatives from the SVA are available to
					consult with anyone interested in establishing a formal
					Student Veterans Club on campus. The establishment
					of such a group will provide the campus with access
					to a long list of potential veterans who can be called
					upon to take part in on-campus training programs for
					faculty and staff. It is much more effective to have
					actual veterans talking about their experiences in the
					classroom. Faculty and staff typically respond more
					favorably when hearing from actual student veterans
					about what is working and not working for them in the
					classroom and what can be done to improve the campus
					climate. The DSS provider can be present to talk more
					about the programs and services that are available to
					veterans with a disability and how this particular group
					of disabled individuals is one that is just starting to
					truly emerge on college campuses and will bring with
					them a new set of challenges.</p>

					<p><em>Faculty and staff training</em>. Through in-service
					training of campus personnel or professional
					development opportunities, faculty and staff become
					aware of the unique challenges of this student
					population. Faculty and staff must be trained in the
					common disability-related adjustments that are most
					prevalent with combat injuries. For example, those with
					PTSD require classroom seating preferences or may
					need to leave the classroom to get relief from anxiety
					symptoms. Students with mild TBI may not know
					the full extent of their limitations until they return to
					school. Faculty may be the first to encourage student
					veterans with suspected disabilities to seek reasonable
					accommodations through DSS. It is important for
					campuses to offer faculty workshops and prepare them
					with an understanding of the common issues veterans
					may bring to the classroom. For universal access and
					to encourage broad faculty participation, campuses
					should offer the workshops online. The degree to which
					DSS is involved in such training should depend upon
					the level of increased awareness and competence with
					this new professional challenge.</p>

					<p><em>On-Campus Mentors</em>. Colleges may identify current
					employees who have served in the military who work
					in administration, faculty and staff. A pool of potential
					mentors and resource specialists may emerge from
					those identified. Those who have experienced combat
					are particularly trusted by returning combat veterans
					and those employees who have served may create a
					more welcoming face for the institution with those
					who are transitioning into the academic community. An
					effective method to increase inclusion of students with
					disabilities is the use of faculty and administrators as
					"resource mentor" networks (Rohland et al., 2003).</p>

					<p><em>Technical standards</em>. Creation of "technical
					standards" for courses and programs of study requires
					a deliberative and collaborative process to outline
					the essential content of coursework and programs
					(Madaus, 2000). Recognition of the needs of veterans
					with functional limitations within that process may
					prove to bridge a dialogue between faculty and DS
					providers in ways that ultimately improve access for
					all students with disabilities. For example, the adoption
					of <em>Universal Design</em> instructional methods may remove
					barriers for this and all other disability groups.</p>

				<section class="section" data-number="3" data-name="Community and System-wide Collaboration">

					<h4>Community and System-wide Collaboration</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">There are numerous community-based entities,
					both public and private, which exist to support active
					duty, reserve, and veteran service members and many
					ways that colleges may create productive working
					relationships with these entities.</span> A Community
					Advisory Board, or "Think Tank" (DO-IT, 2008),
					comprised of VA, DOD, veterans community groups,
					for example, Disabled American Veterans (DAV)
					or Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Vets Center,
					and National Veterans Foundation representatives,
					in collaboration with college specialists, such as
					the ADA/504 Compliance Officer, VSO, Disabled
					Students Services, Financial Aid, Health Services,
					Career Services, Academic Advising, Outreach, may
					be a useful way to stimulate working relationships,
					identify needs, create shared projects, and support
					transitions to careers. Colleges may want to raise
					awareness on their campuses of active duty and
					veterans with and without disabilities through special
					events, particularly Veterans Day and/or Memorial
					Day events. Community group representatives can be
					an integral part of such events. Symposia, or speaker's
					forums, with sessions highlighting topical concerns
					of active duty and veterans on campus, are another
					way to improve communication and understanding
					throughout campus life and forge working relationships
					with community-based entities.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">4</div>

						<span class="pageNumber" style="color:white;">5</span>
					</div>

					<p><em>At the state level</em>. Perhaps the most powerful
					method of propagating institutional change toward
					the treatment of veterans with and without disabilities
					is to have it mandated by the highest authority.
					Within the California State University system,
					Governor Schwarzenegger sent out a clear directive
					to all publically-funded postsecondary institutions
					to significantly increase the number of veterans
					utilizing the Montgomery GI Bill and to make the
					educational programs more accessible and veteran-friendly
					(California State, 2007). A formal body,
					called the <em>"Troops to College" Oversight Committee</em>,
					was established to discuss educational issues between
					California's public colleges and universities and the
					military, identify best practices, develop common
					goals, and measure progress toward those goals. The
					Committee recommended that:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>A Veteran Support Team should be created on
						each campus with each evaluating what works
						best for them;</li>

						<li>Access to Disabled Students Services must be
						achieved for those, due to their combat service,
						who have physical and/or emotional injuries;</li>

						<li>An open line of communication between the
						student, the VSO and DSS Services is crucial
						for a timely identification and proper handling
						of disabled veteran entitlements (California
						State Veteran's Support Team Guide, 2007).</li>
					</ol>

					<p>With Veterans Affairs. At the federal level, the
					US Department of Education, in its letter to service
					members, pointed out that the standards used by
					Veterans Affairs (VA) to review disability claims are
					different from the definition of disability in Section 504
					of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans
					with Disabilities Act (ADA). The federal Office
					of Civil Rights (OCR) noted that "a finding by the
					military or VA that a veteran is entitled to disability-related
					benefits or services does not mean that he
					or she is automatically entitled to receive academic
					adjustments in a postsecondary setting" (Office of the
					Assistant Secretary, 2008). The importance of effective
					communication between postsecondary and military or
					VA entities cannot be overstated, if the student is not
					to fall into a bureaucratic tangle of differing rules and
					regulations. There are so many ways that a veteran with
					a disability can lose some or all of their educational
					benefits that it makes good sense for the DSS service
					provider to establish a solid working relationship
					with their campus VSO and their local Department of
					Veterans Affairs Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor.
					This relationship will be critical so that the DSS
					provider can work in tandem with the campus VSO
					and Veterans Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor to
					ensure everyone has the information required to keep
					the veteran appropriately served. This is especially true
					when the veteran with a disability has to withdraw from
					a class due to their disability. The DSS service provider
					has to communicate the rationale for such a move very
					clearly to both the campus SVO and if applicable, the
					Veterans Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor. Another
					example is when the severely disabled student veteran
					is assigned an <em>extended evaluation</em> status by the VA
					Vocational Rehabilitation with progress documented
					by qualified DSS specialists.</p>

					<p><em>With medical facilities serving the military and
					veterans</em>. VA or Department of Defense (DOD) facilities
					associated with service branches, such as naval or army
					hospitals are in proximity of many college campuses.
					Previously most DSS offices have had little contact with
					the rehabilitation specialists at these institutions.</p>

					<p>Be aware that many individuals entered into
					military service planning to earn education benefi ts
					for college and that the injured service member may
					not have any idea of the ways that educational goals
					may now be achieved. Futhermore, the medical
					specialists may not be knowledgeable about the myriad
					of academic accommodations and technical support
					options that are possible. Therefore, colleges should
					broaden the scope of their outreach and recruitment
					activities to include such facilities with dialogue with
					the rehabilitation specialists. A quote from Lt. Colonel
					David Rabb, VA Palo Alto Health Care System,
					presenting at a California professional conference
					for postsecondary service providers, illustrates the
					importance of collaboration, "When it comes to
					supporting our combat veterans and their families,
					it will take more than DOD and the VA; it takes a
					community" (Rabb, 2008).</p>

					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">5</div>
					<div class="pagebreak">
						<span class="pageNumber" style="color:white;">6</span>
					</div>

					<p>One method used by CSUSM was to offer a workshop
					for either mental health providers or social workers at the
					United States Veterans Hospital at La Jolla, California.
					The workshop focused on transition issues and solutions
					with injured service personnel. Such a workshop may be
					conducted by a team, including Admissions, the VSO Offi ce,
					DSS, and Academic Advisement/Counseling. Another
					approach used by Santa Monica College was to offer a
					<em>transition</em> curriculum, such as study strategies and assistive
					technology, for patient groups at a medical facility, ideally
					instructed by a team from DSS and the VSO Office.</p>

					<p>Vets Centers, affiliated with the US Department of
					Veterans Affairs, have become commonplace throughout
					the nation. They provide peer and professional
					counseling for combat service veterans with PTSD,
					those with sexual assault trauma during active duty and
					their families, in a non-medical setting. Campuses may
					establish a collaborative relationship with their local Vet
					Center; they can provide ongoing counseling support
					for student veterans who qualify and are also a source
					of potential referrals to DSS as well.</p>

					<p><em>With graduate education programs</em>. Many
					professional training programs, such as social work,
					psychology, and occupational therapy, must place their
					students in supervised internships prior to licensure.
					Injured veterans issues have been featured recently in
					numerous professional journals, such as the American
					Psychological Association (Packard, 2007) and the
					American Occupational Therapy Association (Erickson
					et al., 2008), with recognition that this population will
					require specialized professional intervention. Supervision
					and training of such interns within DSS offices, under the
					appropriate professional supervision, should be explored
					to expand the pool of professionals well versed in the
					needs of this population as they attend college.</p>

				<section class="section" data-number="4" data-name="Collaboration and Traumatic Brain Injury">

					<h4>Collaboration and Traumatic Brain Injury</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">A signature injury of Operation Iraqi Freedom
					(OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)
					service members is TBI (Tanielian &amp; Jaycock, 2008).</span>
					Colleges and universities may work collaboratively
					with state, federal and private initiatives that focus
					on the specialized needs of those with TBI. Two such
					initiatives are described here.</p>

					<p><em>Traumatic Brain Injury Act</em>. In 1996, Congress
					passed the Traumatic Brain Injury Act (P.L. 104-
					166) authorizing the Department of Health and
					Human Services, Health Resources and Services
					Administration (HRSA) to grant funds to States to
					build infrastructure capacity, develop and evaluate
					service integration models, establish policy, and
					secure financial support for lasting systems change.
					Between 1997 and 2008, 48 States, two Territories,
					plus the District of Columbia received at least one State
					agency grant (HRSA, 2008). President Bush signed
					the Reauthorization of the TBI Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-
					206), April 28, 2008, which included a new subsection
					with emphasis on military and veterans' populations
					returning to civilian life with TBI. States are currently
					applying for grants under the new legislation. DSS
					with its unique community integration role should
					contribute to these future projects.</p>

					<p><em>Brain Injury Association of America</em>. Brain Injury
					Association of America (BIAA) (2008) is a leading
					national organization that serves and represents
					individuals, families and professionals who are touched
					by TBI. Together with its network of more than 40
					chartered state affi liates, as well as hundreds of local
					chapters and support groups across the country, the
					BIAA provides information, education and support
					to assist those with TBI and their families. DSS may
					draw on these community-based resource referrals
					for students and their families, especially in regions
					without fully developed VA outreach.</p>

				<section class="section" data-number="5" data-name="Conclusion">

					<h4>Conclusion</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Postsecondary institutions should establish cutting
