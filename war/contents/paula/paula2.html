					<h1>Deserving Design: The New Generation of Student Veterans</h1>

					<h2>Cheryl Branker<br/>North Carolina State University</h2>

					<h3>Abstract</h3>

					<p class="abstract"><span class="first-sentence">Thousands of veterans with disabilities have become students since their return from combat.</span> Many such veterans,
					though, are finding that their combat experiences often create an undeserving imbalance for them as they trade
					ammunition for education. And many colleges, where these veterans attend, are finding that they are ill prepared to
					level the playing field for them. The purpose of this article is to integrate research on undergraduate education and
					Universal Design (UD) to forge a framework for designing a balanced university environment for student veterans
					with disabilities. Specific components that campuses should consider incorporating to help student veterans with
					disabilities manage their challenges and ease into reintegration will also be discussed.</p>

					<p>Many college students have difficulty with
					balance – balancing their many social choices with
					their academic responsibilities. Natasha McKinnon, a
					student studying animal science at NC State, is taking
					the necessary steps to find her balance in the university.
					This is in addition to her finding her balance with her
					new left foot.</p>

					<p>In October 2005, McKinnon was a soldier riding in
					the front seat of a Humvee in Iraq when an improvised
					explosive device (IED) went off underneath it. Black
					smoke filled the vehicle making it impossible for her
					to see her injuries. But when she reached down to
					retrieve her weapon, she remembers, “I could feel
					blood” (Quillin, 2008). Her training taught her to apply
					a tourniquet; she did that and lived. But when she woke
					up in a military hospital in Baghdad, there was shrapnel
					in her right leg and her left leg was severed below the
					knee (Quillin, 2008).</p>

					<p>After two years of recovery at Walter Reed Army
					Medical Center and more than 20 prosthetic limbs later,
					McKinnon is able to walk some without assistance, but
					usually relies on a cane or crutches. From her apartment,
					she drives to campus and seeks out accessible parking
					spaces as close to her classroom buildings as possible.
					She has learned to build in extra time to “hunt” for spaces
					and loop around buildings to reach access ramps and
					elevators, so as to avoid stairs. By the time she gets to
					class, McKinnon says, “I don’t have the energy to hear
					what the prof is saying” (Quillin, 2008).</p>

					<p>As tens of thousands of veterans with physical
					and/or mental impairments from Afghanistan and Iraq
					use their GI Bill benefits, McKinnon and others like
					her are finding that their combat experiences often
					create an undeserving imbalance for them as they trade
					ammunition for education. Education, according to Oak
					(2008) is a “self-enlightening process; an important
					component of life” (p.1). Higher education’s challenge
					is to level this imbalance for student veterans with
					disabilities by creating a complete college education
					through the use of intentional design.</p>

					<h4>Complete Education</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">What is meant by a complete education?</span> McCain
					(2005) views it as faculty melding school skills with real-world
					skills. When faculty teach school skills, they are
					engaged in the acculturation of individuals by passing
					on societal knowledge and wisdom. These skills equip
					students to become informed, thoughtful citizens capable
					of processing the complexities of modern life. When
					faculty teach real-world skills, they are emphasizing the
					acquisition of practical problem-solving skills, which
					enables students to successfully apply their learning to
					real-life situations in the workplace and in their personal
					lives.</p>

					<p>If queried, most student veterans with disabilities
					would probably agree that they expect faculty within
					their chosen curriculum to expose them to both sets
					of skills. However, for some faculty, doing so would
					interfere with their proclivity to tell students what
					they need to know and do, after which they test them
					to see if they retained the information. For long-term
					content retention (school skills) and life-skill learning
					(real-world skills), McCain (2005) suggests that faculty
					need to design a methodology for problem solving.
					This would require substantially altering the roles
					of faculty and student such that faculty would focus
					on structuring problems that would allow for student
					self-discovery. The designing of such an educational
					experience would probably be quite a daunting task
					for faculty, as many of them do not see themselves as
					“designers” of course content but as “purveyors” of the
					content contained in the pre-selected textbook.</p>

					<h4>Use of Design to Solve Problems</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Bhan (2007) believes that design is a philosophy,
					based on a system of values, which seeks to solve
					problems.</span> Similarly, Archer (1973) and Jones (1970)
					offer that design is experience, skill, and knowledge
					being used rationally, logically, sequentially, and
					intentionally to solve problems.</p>

					<p>The instructor/designer then identifies and
					analyzes a problem or need and proceeds through a
					structured sequence by which information is researched
					and ideas are explored and evaluated until the most
					favorable solution to the problem or need is forged (UK
					Technology Education Centre, 1996). The solution
					will not be reached though without knowing whether
					or not the problem to be solved has been correctly
					framed (Bhan, 2007).</p>

				</section>

				<section class="section" data-number="3" data-name="A Universal Design Approach">

					<h4>A Universal Design Approach</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">The framing of the problem by the designing
					instructor involves answering the questions, “What
					do I want my students to know/experience in my
					course,” and “What do I want them to be able to do,
					once my course is over?”</span> (Gocsik, 2007). When the
					answers become apparent, they become the framework
					by which an inclusive teaching model - a universally
					designed model – is created. This model will inherently
					advocate for responding to the myriad of learning needs
					of student veterans in higher education classrooms.
					This is also human-centered design, an approach that
					solves problems by conditions/constraints of the end
					user, the student. The understanding of such will help
					dictate the goals of the course.</p>

					<p>The designing instructor should then work
					backwards to ensure that all readings, writings,
					discussions, examinations, and practical experiences
					would connect students with the questions, problems,
					and skills that the instructor deems essential to the
					course. When the designing instructor can successfully
					design a course that meets an unmet need for
					information/knowledge, it becomes good design. This
					universal/intentional/human-centered design approach
					asks faculty to rethink some fundamental educational
					concepts, to contemplate educational equity for all
					kinds of learners, and to consider a variety of ways in
					which the educational environment can be designed
					or adapted to accommodate students’ current and
					changing needs.</p>

					<p>It seems likely that if individual faculty can be
					empowered to become intentional course designers,
					then so can universities become intentional/universal/
					human-centered designers of students’ total campus
					experiences. Thinking within this paradigm, the
					seminal question becomes, how do we design campus
					experiences that help to prompt the student veteran
					with disabilities, to take responsibility for, and control
					over, his or her own learning?</p>

					<h4>Designing Campus Experiences for Wounded Warriors</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">The war in Iraq and the Afghanistan operation
					have had, and will continue to have, profound effects
					on military service members returning from combat
					and entering college classrooms as combat is a lifechanging
					event.</span> Many colleges and universities have
					spent enormous amounts of money and resources on
					homecoming ceremonies but “homecoming” should
					be more than an event, it should be a process fueled
					by various campus resources that seek to connect the
					student veterans with the institution. For many service
					members turned students, college life is about seeking
					new purposes and reclaiming their adult lives. Lives
					they began in the military to become civil, productive,
					and responsible citizens. The same lives that have now
					been altered by the physical and/or mental impairments
					they now have as a result of their military service.</p>

					<p>A college dedicated to designing a complete
					education for student veterans with disabilities should
					embody equality, excellence, and diversity. When they
					were service members, these students had to push
					themselves physically and mentally in preparation
					for military life. They had to make adaptations so as
					to survive in combat. They had to deal with constant
					threat and uncertainty on the battlefield. They should
					not have to deal with constant threat and uncertainty
					on our college campuses because of poor design.</p>

					<p>At North Carolina State University, student
					veterans were polled and asked to respond to these
					two questions among others:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>Rate your experience – <em>outstanding, very good,
						fair, disappointing</em> – regarding your transition
						from the military to the University and to what
						do you attribute your experience?</li>

						<li>How can the University assist you in your
						transition?</li>
					</ol>

					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">3</div>
					<div class="pagebreak">
						<span class="pageNumber" style="color:white;">4</span>
					</div>

					<p>One respondent stated, It’s not quite what I thought
					it was going to be because it’s two totally different
					worlds. I really didn’t realize how different I was from
					the majority of my class until I got here.</p>

					<p>Another student veteran said:</p>

					<p>The major problem here is there is such a difference
					between me and my 17- and 18-year old classmates.
					Plus I know absolutely nobody here and that difference
					between us makes it hard to make friends. Younger
					classmates tend to look at you a little differently; which
					they should….but…it makes it tough to be social.
					Meeting other veterans would definitely help because
					we are on the same page. We understand each other.</p>

					<p>While these comments come from student
					veterans taking courses at NC State, they are probably
					representative of the sentiments of this new generation
					of student veterans on other campuses across the
					country; student veterans who are deserving of
					intentional/universal/human-centered design of the
					physical, programmatic, informational, and attitudinal
					environments within higher education. Designing with
					such intent should result in naturally inclusive, barrier
					free learning and social environments that create value
					and enhance the student veterans’ experiences requiring
					fewer adaptations and accommodations.</p>

					<h4>Strategic Design</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">When engineers set out to solve problems, they
					use a design process that provides them with general
					directions regarding the steps they must take.</span> When
					the steps are followed sequentially, the odds are
					increased that the design will work. When possible,
					complete education designers should follow the
					steps summarized in Table 1. Specifically, they need
					to understand the challenges of student veterans
					with disabilities on their specific campuses before
					attempting to solve them.</p>

					<p>Once identified, the designers should research all
					that is related to the challenges that have been identifi ed.
					The designers should ask if similar challenges to those
					of the student veterans with disabilities have been
					met before on their campuses? If so, how? If not, why
					not? Then, because the best solution to a problem
					is not always the first idea conceived, ideas should
					be exchanged in an open forum with a variety of
					constituencies present.</p>

					<p>When an idea about a solution has been settled on,
					intentional designers should prepare detailed plans for
					such, and solicit feedback. They should also expect to
					modify the design for a complete education for student
					veterans with disabilities as feedback is received.</p>

					<p>The only way for intentional designers to know if
					their design will work in real-world conditions is to
					create a pilot student veterans with disabilities program
					and then test it. If during the pilot program, the initial
					design doesn’t fully solve the problem or meet the
					challenge, the designers should go back and repeat
					the above steps. Since what doesn’t work will now be
					apparent, the designers will be in a better position to
					develop an idea that does work on behalf of student
					veterans with disabilities. If the design does solve
					the problem, then it’s on to the final step, which is to
					implement it (Teachers’ Domain, 2004).</p>

				<section class="section" data-number="6" data-name="Merging Teaching and Learning Practices with Principles of Universal Design">

					<h4>Merging Teaching and Learning Practices with
					Principles of Universal Design</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">The extended research of undergraduate education
					done by Chickering and Gamson (1987) produced
					seven practices for improving teaching and learning:</span>
					(a) encourage contact between students and faculty,
					(b) develop reciprocity and cooperation among
					students, (c) encourage active learning, (d) give prompt
					feedback, (e) emphasize time on task, (f) communicate
					high expectations, and (g) respect diverse talents and
					ways of learning. While each practice can stand alone,
					when they are all present in undergraduate education,
					their effects are exponential and employ powerful
					forces: activity, expectations, cooperation, interaction,
					diversity, and responsibility.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">4</div>
					<div class="pagebreak">
						<span class="pageNumber" style="color:white;">5</span>
					</div>

					<p>These practices and forces have an uncanny but
					natural resemblance to the Principles of UD: (a)
					equitable use, (b) flexibility in use, (c) simple and
					intuitive use, (d) perceptible information, (e) tolerance
					for error, (f) low physical effort, and (g) size and space
					for approach and use (Center for Universal Design,
					1997). This resemblance is because the seven principles
					for good practice and the seven principles for UD
					concern matters of equitable access to education. They
					promote equity and further the development of diverse
					and engaged student citizens.</p>

					<p>As seen in Table 2, infusing these practices and
					principles in the design process outlined above,
					results in a complete education for student veterans
					with disabilities. A complete education is useful to
					participants with diverse abilities who bring different
					talents and styles of learning to college. Student
					veterans developed numerous skills that kept them
					alive in combat. They will need the opportunity to
					demonstrate these skills and learn in ways that work
					for them. Once that happens, they can be encouraged
					to learn in new ways.</p>

					<p>The approach is flexible to accommodate a
					wide range of individual preferences but it will also
					acknowledge that learning is enhanced when it is more
					like a team effort. In combat, unit cohesion was vital
					for survival, so an intentionally designed educational
					environment for student veterans with disabilities
					should emphasize collaboration, not competition and
					isolation. Intentionally designed education is easy to
					understand, regardless of the student’s experience,
					knowledge, language skills, or current concentration
					levels, but if the student veteran with disabilities is
					having difficulty, an environment that encourages
					contact between them and faculty/staff is important.
					Having concerned faculty helps student veterans get
					through the difficult times and keep moving forward.</p>

					<p>It also lends itself to being easy to communicate
					necessary information effectively to the student
					veteran regardless of his/her sensory abilities.
					And the knowledge of the presence of student
					veterans’ functional limitations would never mean
					that expectations are lowered. Some veterans turned
					students, chose the military for reasons other than
					patriotism. They chose military service because they
					felt poorly prepared and never thought they could
					succeed in college and serving their county seemed to
					be a viable alternative to working in a minimum wage
					paying job. High expectations at the college level are
					important, and they should be for student veterans with
					disabilities as well. Expecting them to perform well
					becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

					<p>Students, in many ways, are novices and subject to
					mistakes. A well designed education makes it possible
					to minimize the adverse consequences of unintended
					actions. Soldiers in combat are trained to make split
					second lethal decisions in often highly ambiguous
					environments. This kind of targeted aggression keeps
					the soldier alert, awake, and alive. Students who
					make hasty decisions and execute unintended actions
					are often the recipients of adverse consequences on
					college campuses. Student veterans with disabilities
					will benefit from experiences that help them in learning
					that rarely will they need to make such harrowing split
					second decisions and that when a decision needs to be
					made, they should spend the necessary time to do so.
					While in Iraq or Afghanistan, the student veteran did
					not have the luxury of time so helping them understand
					that there is no substitute for time on task is crucial.
					Allocating realistic amounts of time to tasks yields
					high performance.</p>

					<p>When intention is given to design, it is possible
					for student veterans with disabilities to participate
					in all components of their complete education with
					efficiency and a minimum of fatigue. There is very
					little that can be accomplished by just sitting and
					listening, as attending college is not a spectator sport.
					But, attending college should not be such an arduous
					physical feat that it prohibits active participation by
					student veterans with disabilities.</p>

					<p>It also makes it possible for the student veterans
					with disabilities to fully participate in the complete
					educational experience regardless of their body size,
					posture, mobility, or psychological motility. A student
					veteran’s knowledge or perception about where they
					can “fit in” or ”be a part of” is the basis of what
					they decide to experience while on our campuses.
					While in combat, the service members had to have
					control of their emotions; it was critical for mission
					success. Expressing to others that they feel the size
					and/or space is not conducive to them for approach,
					reach, manipulation, and use can be difficult, if not
					impossible, for most student veterans with disabilities.
					Sometimes a student veteran’s perspective about such
					is narrow. Having persons who can provide student
					veterans with disabilities with prompt feedback about
					such concerns is paramount. When just getting started,
					the student veteran will likely need help in assessing
					their existing competencies. As they progress, they will
					need frequent opportunities to participate and receive
					suggestions for improvement and to reflect on it all.</p>

				<section class="section" data-number="7" data-name="Reintegration">

					<h4>Reintegration</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">While it is probably true that most college
					campuses will present some imbalances for student
					veterans with disabilities, the proportion or distribution
					of that imbalance will be specific to each institution
					and each student.</span> McKinnon, the soldier who lost
					her leg in Iraq in 2005, noted that “not only am I a
					full-time student, I’m a full-time patient. It takes a
					toll, mentally and physically. Sometimes I’m there in
					class, but only in body. Not in mind” (Quillin, 2008).
					This student veteran’s experience may be considered
					extreme nonetheless; it is what she brings to the
					classroom. Given the myriad of experiences of student
					veterans with disabilities, it is quite obvious that there
					is no one design that will work on all campuses for
					creating a complete education. However, there are
					a few components, summarized in Table 3, which
					should probably be included by all campuses so as to
					help student veterans with disabilities manage their
					challenges and ease into reintegration.</p>

					<p>Students of color, first-generation students, and low-income
					students are typically considered to be “historically
					underserved students.” It could be convincingly argued
					that many student veterans with disabilities would or
					could claim a place in such a list of those not typically
					served well in postsecondary institutions. For historically
					underserved students, transitioning to college and
					adjusting to the academic and social demands and
					responsibilities can be a great challenge (Green, 2006).
					Student veterans with disabilities may not be as prepared
					as their civilian non-disabled peers and may need
					campuses to rethink and reframe existing paradigms if
					they intend to reintegrate, retain, and eventually graduate
					this population of students.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">6</div>
					<div class="pagebreak">
						<span class="pageNumber" style="color:white;">7</span>
					</div>

					<p>From their first interactions with the university
					and through their first weeks and months as students,
					these former veterans should be exposed to thoughtful
					engagement efforts. Kuh (2007) offers that students
					who talk about substantive matters with their faculty
					are challenged to perform at high levels, receive
					frequent feedback, get better grades, are more satisfied
					with their educational experience, thus more likely to
					persist. Colleges must be willing to learn more about
					these students and induce them to participate.</p>

					<p>Student veterans with a disabilities may also need
					mentoring; a relational process in which an experienced
					person, a mentor, accompanies them as they begin
					to examine what they are learning and experiencing
					in college and evaluate how these experiences affect
					their sense of who they are. The mentor should be a
					person who knows or has experienced something and
					can transfer that something, whether it is wisdom,
					information, confidence, insight, etc., to the student
					veteran at an appropriate time and manner, so as to
					facilitate development or empowerment. This kind of
					mentoring, as defined by Stanley and Clinton (1992),
					is intensive and deliberative and is entered into with
					depth and awareness of effort.</p>

					<div class="border"></div>

					<p>Sarason, Sarason, and Pierce (1990) believe that
					social support is important because it can provide a
					“safety net” for a student to explore and experiment
					in the world. Students, who perceive that they are
					supported, feel that they have someone to turn to when
					problems occur. Given that, there should be available
					programming that will allow student veterans with
					disabilities to connect with other student veterans, with
					and/or without disabilities, from the same war/conflict.
					McKinnon shared that she spent nights and weekends
					studying and didn’t have time to form close friendships
					at school. But she said she would enjoy vets’ company
					because “they’ve been there” (Quillin, 2008).</p>

					</div>

					<p>Student veterans returning from Iraq and
					Afghanistan will, of course, have different combinations
					of disabilities depending on the type of injury endured
					but they will all likely experience some difficulty with
					memory, concentration, and communication. These
					limitations will necessitate detailed information about
					the programs, resources, and support services offered
					at their university and in the community that will
					benefit and empower them to be successful. Without
					detailed information, the student veteran will have little
					opportunity to make informed choices.</p>

					<p>Opportunities that will allow student veterans to
					develop, or continue to develop, leadership skills of
					integrity so as to enable positive action, accountability,
					and personal development are also vital. When student
					veterans with disabilities are engaged in leadership
					experiences, they can see the possibility of making their
					dreams a reality. As the dream develops through these
					experiences, they are more inclined to work hard at the
					relationships that sustain that momentum, thus keeping
					them at a level of high integrity and eventual success.</p>

					<p>In addition, these students will need opportunities
					to network with faculty, staff, and administrators across
					campus who are decision makers and are making things
					happen. It’s about them obtaining information and making
					contacts that could help them in their day-to-day life. It’s
					also an essential tool for their professional development.</p>

					<p>As is true for all students, but especially student
					veterans with disabilities, they need to have a plan –
					a clear goal and a step-by-step strategy - for getting
					there. This can be achieved through deliberate
					academic advising. This type of advising is more than
					just putting the student veteran with disabilities in
					classes. This advising entails understanding how the
					student veteran’s functional limitations, due to combat,
					impact academic outcomes. For this to be successful, it
					requires responsible, pro-active behavior on the part of
					the advisors. The students must be seen as individuals
					whose uniqueness and diversity are important. This
					is taken into consideration from the beginning of
					their academic journey until they have graduated or
					transferred. This is known as intrusive advisement;
					advisement based on the philosophy that the advisor
					and the student share responsibility for the student’s
					academic success or failure. Intrusive advisors are
					available, maintain clear boundaries, and truly know
					the college or university and the staff involved in
					various programs (Connell, 2003, as cited in Thomas
					&amp; Minton, 2004).</p>

					<p>And even when courses, programs, attitudes, and
					environments have been created inclusively, with all
					the dynamics of academic life considered, there will
					still be some student veterans who are having difficulty
					participating fully due to their functional limitations.
					The welcoming campus then, through its supportive
					network, refers these students to the Disability Services
					Office for the facilitation of reasonable academic
					accommodations so that they may successfully
					complete the essential requirements of all courses.</p>
