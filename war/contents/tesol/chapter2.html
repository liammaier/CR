				Research in Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL)
			</h3>

			<p>
				The TESOL Technology Standards are informed by and best understood with 
				background knowledge of the theory and research that have emerged in the field of 
				CALL. There is currently no clearly articulated single theory specific to technology 
				use in language teaching that could be used to inform these standards. Numerous 
				scholars believe that the theoretical foundation for this field comes from a multitude 
				of sources. Following Ellis (1999), Chapelle (2003, p. 56) takes the key concept of 
				interaction and discusses three theoretical perspectives: the interaction hypothesis, 
				sociocultural theory, and depth of processing theory. For each perspective, she 
				demonstrates how a computer can help a language learner in some relevant way—by 
				providing enhanced input, help for using language, and opportunities for increased 
				attention to language, respectively. Those looking for a more unified view may find it 
				in Egbert, Hanson-Smith, and Chao (2007). These authors take the position that “the 
				hypothetical theory of CALL sounds not much different from an integrated theory of 
				language acquisition; in fact, it is the same” (p. 1).
			</p>

			<p>
				Levy and Stockwell (2006) reach a similar conclusion, noting that “with rare 
				exceptions, CALL designers and language teachers are predominantly in the role of 
				consumers as far as theory is concerned. For those in this group who see value in 
				theory (and it must be said not all do), they review, select, and apply theories of 
				language learning produced by others” (p. 139). Kern (2006) links this relationship 
				of consumerism to a general issue in second language acquisition (SLA) theory: 
				Citing Kramsch (2000), he observes, “it is important to bear in mind that SLA is itself

			<p>
				informed by a rich variety of theoretical frameworks and has consistently resisted a 
				single overarching theory” (p. 187).
			</p>

			<p>
				The situation with research in the CALL field is similar. Egbert and Hanson-Smith 
				(2007) attempt to unify the field by organizing their edited volume with results 
				from a broad research base. In that volume, the introduction (Egbert, HansonSmith, & Chao, 2007)
				delves into eight optimal conditions for language learning. 
				However, Levy and Stockwell (2006) identify six research strands with accompanying 
				representative studies reflecting a “mix of approaches, methods, research tools, 
				and procedures” (p. 157). An edited volume devoted specifically to CALL research 
				(Egbert & Petrie, 2005) includes 12 chapters representing a wide variety of research 
				perspectives and providing further evidence of fragmentation that is similar in many 
				respects to divergences in SLA and general learning theory.
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition to the work above, a strand of recent relevant literature centers specifically 
				on language teacher education in the technology domain. Special issues of <em>Language 
				Learning and Technology</em> (2002) and <em>Innovation in Language Learning and Teaching</em>
				(2009), along with edited volumes by Hubbard and Levy (2006b) and Kassen, 
				Lavine, Murphy-Judy, and Peters (2007), focus on this area. Among the themes found 
				in multiple contributions to this literature are the value of project-based learning, 
				the importance of reflective learning, linkages to communities of practice, and 
				development of teacher candidate portfolios (for more details, see Chapter 6 in this 
				volume). Each of these edited volumes also includes a chapter on standards: MurphyJudy and Youngs (2006)
				and Oxford with Jung (2007), the latter taking a highly critical view of current implementations.
			</p>

			<p>
				Despite the large number of theories and research approaches, it is possible to 
				identify three general themes that both support the need for the TESOL Technology 
				Standards and identify necessary content for the standards themselves.
			</p>

			<h5>
				1. Research shows that there are important benefits to be gained from the use 
				of technology in language learning and teaching.
			</h5>

			<p>
				Numerous studies looking at the effect of CALL on language learning support the 
				integration of CALL in language teaching. A recent research synthesis by Grgurovic;
				and Chapelle (2007), looking at 200 experimental and quasi-experimental studies 
				between 1970 and 2006, revealed that (a) computer instruction is slightly better than 
				“traditional” instruction even under the most rigorous methodological conditions 
				and that (b) “improvement is detected for CALL groups more often than not” (slide 
				24). Consequently, it is imperative that teachers be able to make decisions about the 
				role of CALL in their pedagogy. However, only teachers with sufficient knowledge 
				about CALL can make that decision wisely.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is also evidence indicating important benefits of technology in language 
				learning and teaching. These are found mainly in

			<ol>
				<li>
					improved motivation and development of positive attitudes toward 
					learning and the target language (e.g., Meunier, 1997; Pennington, 1996; 
					Warschauer, 1996),
				</li>

				<li>
					improved learning outcomes (e.g., Brandl, 2002), and
				</li>

				<li>
					improved retention rates (e.g., Ioannou-Georgiou & Michaelides, 2001).
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				Additional applications of CALL that have been studied include access to linguistic 
				and cultural materials, opportunities for communication, provision of feedback, 
				and learner motivation. Zhao’s (2003) synthesis outlines efforts in these areas and 
				calls for further research on comprehensive curriculum development, effective use of 
				technology, classroom uses of technology, and empirical studies on how technology 
				is used in schools.
			</p>

			<h5>
				2. Technology should be incorporated into teaching pedagogy so that students 
				will not only effectively acquire a second language but will also 
				develop electronic literacy skills.
			</h5>

			<p>
				Teaching our students language in its traditional media is no longer enough. 
				Traditional literacies, such as reading and writing, are now only a subset of the skills a 
				learner is required to develop in order to function efficiently. Increasingly, in everyday 
				and professional life, people need the skills of electronic literacy, such as accessing, 
				evaluating, and utilizing information (Warschauer, Shetzer, & Meloni, 2000).
			</p>

			<p>
				Chapelle and Jamieson (2008) argue for an expanded view of English language 
				teaching pedagogy, which now ought to include not only the learner, the English 
				language, and the teacher, but also technology as an integral part. Chapelle and 
				Jamieson articulate three assumptions of language learning on page 3 in the 
				introduction to their book:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					Guidance in learning a language is necessary.
				</li>

				<li>
					English manifests itself in many varieties.
				</li>

				<li>
					Teachers provide guidance and structure.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				They explain that CALL may be able to provide opportunities to complement alreadyused teaching strategies.
				Specifically, CALL can foster skills development (reading, 
				writing, listening, speaking), but it can also further language proficiency development 
				by providing learners with the opportunity to practice these skills, which is, as recent 
				research suggests, how language is learned (Lightbown & Spada, 2006).
			</p>

			<p>
				Integration figures prominently in the current discussion of CALL, in writings 
				by Levy and Stockwell (2006), Bax (2003), and others. Scholars debate certain 
				aspects of the notion of integration and how to achieve it, but with the ubiquity 
				of today’s technology, it is difficult to justify not using CALL in language learning. 
				It is, therefore, imperative that English language teachers integrate information 
				and communication technologies (ICT) in the classroom so that students become

			<p>
				proficient in communication not only within the traditional media but also within 
				the framework of modern communication technologies (Lee, 2002, inter alia).
			</p>

			<p>
				The use of technology in English language teaching and learning can also encourage 
				the development of strategies necessary for modern survival: communication, 
				collaboration, and information gathering and retrieval. Preparing students 
				for the information society should be one of the fundamental aims of today’s 
				education (European Commission, 2001; Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
				and Development, 2000; U.S. Department of Education, 2000). Ultimately, 
				technologically skilled individuals benefit not only themselves but also their country 
				of residence. Australia, for example, has already recognized the great importance 
				to the country’s economy of training individuals to work in an online environment 
				(Australian National Office for the Information Economy, 1998, as cited in 
				Davison, 2005).
			</p>

			<p>
				Hubbard and Levy (2006a) emphasize the importance of CALL beyond the 
				classroom, such as in the “research and development of a wide range of products 
				including online courses, programs, tutors, and tools” (p. 9) and in the repurposing 
				of off-the-shelf software. The common theme here is that technology is and should 
				be used for language learning purposes.
			</p>

			<h5>
				3. Research shows that technology in learning is not being used to its 
				full potential and that inadequate teacher training and learner training 
				are some of the main reasons for this.
			</h5>

			<p>
				The importance of basing teacher training on standards and the detriment of not 
				meeting the standards are discussed by Oxford with Jung (2007). They note that 
				technology standards already exist for primary and secondary (preK–12) teachers and 
				students in the United States, but indicate that the standards are routinely not being 
				met in settings with English language learners, for reasons that include problems with 
				schools of education, teacher educators, and institutional infrastructures. Oxford and 
				Jung conclude with research-based advice aimed at solving this problem.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are, therefore, significant benefits to language learning that can be achieved by 
				using new technologies and by enabling students to obtain basic survival skills for 
				the modern society and workplace. How many of these potential benefits are actually 
				brought to the students, however, is questionable. Cuban (2001) gives evidence that 
				computers are underused in today’s classrooms. In general education and in language 
				learning alike, Cuban writes, computers are mostly used for teacher preparation, 
				and mainly for word processing. Even where computers are not used as expensive 
				typewriters, and where teachers use them in instruction, traditional teaching 
				techniques prevail. As a result, the technology’s potential for developing critical-thinking
				skills and learner autonomy remains largely unrealized.
			</p>

			<p>
				Cuban asserts that this is not due to limited access to technology. Rather, he suggests 
				that it might be due to the way teachers use the technology, thus implicating teachers’ 
				inadequate training in the area of pedagogical uses of technology. However, teacher
			</p>

			<p>
				training must also include learner training. In other words, teachers who use CALL 
				must be trained to teach learners how to use CALL programs, an issue discussed by 
				Hubbard and Levy (2006a). Foundations for learner training in using technology for 
				language acquisition, especially as it relates to developing learner autonomy, can be 
				found in Barrette (2001), Healey (2007), and Hubbard (2004).
			</p>

			<p>
				This need for increased training and proficiency in the use of technology is echoed 
				by Kessler (2006), who points out that “teachers need to become more proficient in 
				their understanding of CALL methodology, practices, history, and possibility” (p. 35). 
				Along the same lines, Chapelle and Hegelheimer (2004) argue that “the resources 
				offered by today’s technologies for language learners and teachers provide valuable 
				opportunity to rethink and perhaps reinvent what constitutes the knowledge base for 
				L2 teachers” (p. 314).
				
			<p>
				Thus, with the weight of responsibility falling on the teachers and their work, the 
				existence of the TESOL Technology Standards will play a positive role. The standards 
				can help teachers and teacher preparation programs move forward and guide them in 
				increasing the quality use of new technologies during instruction in ways that realize 
				technology’s potential. Further, developing an understanding of the growing body of 
				CALL research will not only inform the interpretation and use of these standards but 
				also contribute to future revisions to the standards.
			</p>

			<p>
				Research has investigated specific domains within CALL, including telecollaboration, 
				computer-mediated communication (CMC), tutorial CALL, online learning, and 
				resource CALL. Across these domains we can observe pedagogical implications from 
				the research in two ways: as they relate to the learning of language skills and as they 
				relate to the role of the CALL environment. It is important for teachers to be aware 
				of these studies because collectively they emphasize that integrating technology 
				effectively into language classrooms requires more than simply laying knowledge 
				of the technology on top of their basic classroom procedures. The studies cited 
				here provide a foundation for meeting the targets of Teacher Goal 2, Standard 4: 
				<em>Language teachers use relevant research findings to inform the planning of language learning 
				activities and tasks that involve technology</em>. Table 2.1 provides a brief overview of some 
				implications from research into individual language skills.
			</p>

			<p>
				Research has also been conducted regarding the nature of various CALL task types 
				and environments. Many of these studies provide guidance for ways in which teachers 
				can use general and language learning software within specific contexts and language 
				tasks. Some of the trends from this research are presented in Table 2.2.
			</p>

			<p>
				Research in CALL has followed methodological trends in the broader area of second 
				language acquisition (SLA). Survey results have been used often, typically to identify 
				perceptions or attitudes toward some element of CALL. Comparative studies have 
				been conducted in order to compare the integration of CALL into a curriculum 
				with traditional teaching methods. Observational studies based upon language 
				transcription have been conducted in order to analyze linguistic functions that may 
				provide insight into SLA within CALL contexts. Some have recognized the limitations

				Conclusion

			<p>
				As we can see, CALL research and theory are informed by a diversity of academic 
				investigation. We understand that technology has been identified as a beneficial 
				component in language teaching and learning when properly incorporated into 
				teaching pedagogy. This understanding recognizes that teachers require preparation 
				to identify and integrate technology in their teaching pedagogy. We have learned 
				that technology can be harnessed to strengthen language learning strategies,

				cultural knowledge, and individual language skills. This chapter highlights specific 
				language-skill-related findings within the field of CALL. We have also learned 
				how the integration of technology varies across different domains, task types, 
				and environments. This variety of integration must be recognized for teachers to 
				effectively address the technology standards. Finally, we understand the changes in 
				methodological approaches within CALL. These can influence teachers’ perspective on 
				the research and contribute to their own reflective practices, including action research. 
				This overview of theoretical and research bases that have informed CALL is intended 
				to serve as support for integration of the TESOL Technology Standards. This review 
				is not intended to be a comprehensive evaluation of CALL research. Readers who are 
				interested in further exploration of CALL research would benefit from consulting the
