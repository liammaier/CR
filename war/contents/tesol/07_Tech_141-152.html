			<h2>
				Implications and Recommendations for Teacher Educators
			</h2>

			<p class="chapterSummary">
				This chapter addresses why the standards are important for teacher 
				educators and teacher trainers. It also suggests ways to incorporate the 
				standards into teacher education programs.
			</p>

			<p>
				The use of digital technology in language teaching is growing, yet it is clear that many 
				teachers are completing professional certificate and degree programs that include 
				little if any formal instruction in using technology for teaching (Hubbard, 2008; 
				Kessler, 2006). Given the potential for new teachers to be in the field for 40 years or 
				more, it is critical that such a practice not continue.
			</p>

			<p>
				Kessler (2007) notes that a high percentage of graduates from Master of Arts in TESOL 
				(MA TESOL) programs were dissatisfied with the preparation they received for using 
				technology in language teaching. All those who responded to the survey underlying 
				his study were active on professional email lists and therefore somewhat technically 
				inclined. This implies that the problem is likely to be even worse than reported. 
			</p>

			<p>
				With the increasing centrality of technology in many language learning settings, 
				it is not clear why the topic is treated so haphazardly in many teacher education 
				programs. One likely explanation, though, is the lack of sufficient interest, training, 
				and experience among the teacher educators themselves. The problem is one of 
				inertia: there is a tendency for courses or programs that appear successful in meeting 
				their goals to continue to conduct their teacher training in the same way that has 
				worked for them in the past. One purpose of the TESOL Technology Standards is to 
				motivate programs of all sorts that train English language teachers to overcome that 
				inertia by
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					recognizing	that	they	have	an	obligation	to	prepare	teacher	candidates
					adequately in technology proficiency for their field and 
				</li>

				<li>
					upgrading	their	own	staff	of	teacher	educators	if	needed,	either	by	providing
					them with additional knowledge and skill (training the trainers—Rickard, 
					Blin, & Appel, 2006) or by making technology proficiency a high priority in 
					their new hires.

			<p>
				The more institutional problems in teacher education programs are caused by a 
				lack of three things: an understanding of the role of technology, a will to change, 
				and the necessary expertise. In addition, there are barriers in the teacher candidates 
				themselves. These include teacher resistance, technophobia (Robb, 2006), lack 
				of teacher readiness, and a naïve view that technology skills and knowledge from 
				personal use will be sufficient for language teaching. The last point is an extension 
				of Prensky (2001). Prensky’s claim that the rising generation is digitally “native” may 
				be interpreted to mean that technology training is not needed for young teacher 
				candidates, at least in countries where technology is pervasive. A large-scale study of 
				language students at a U.S. university by Winke & Goertler (2008) offers convincing 
				evidence that this is not the case for learners. It seems reasonable to extend their 
				conclusions to language teachers. By emphasizing the TESOL Technology Standards 
				as standards, rather than as an optional add-on as has so often been the case with 
				technology training, educators can provide motivation to teachers who might 
				otherwise be reluctant to immerse themselves in the digital stream. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition to the issue of teacher preparation programs, there is the question of 
				how to help those who have completed their professional preparation and are now 
				engaged in practice. Teacher educators can be involved in formal in-service training 
				initiatives (e.g., Rickard et al., 2006) as well as informal ones, such as conference 
				workshops. In some ways, this issue is a larger one than that of teacher preparation 
				programs. The scale of the problem is due to the sheer number of practicing teachers 
				with an inadequate understanding of how to use technology appropriately to support 
				their teaching. It is hoped that the standards will serve as a strong incentive for 
				professional organizations, teacher education departments, and individual English 
				language programs to begin assessing and educating in-service teachers to meet the 
				targets specified in the performance indicators.

			<h3>
				Theoretical Grounding and Frameworks
			</h3>

			<p>
				Some of the established concepts in teacher education are particularly relevant for 
				technology training. This section provides a brief overview of three of these along 
				with a summary of a general framework for language teacher technology education. 
				Specifically, we will look at situated learning, reflective learning, and project-based 
				learning. While conceptually distinct, these three approaches can be and often are 
				coherently integrated.
			</p>

			<section class="subsection" data-number="3" data-name="Situated learning">

				<h4>
					Situated learning
				</h4>

				<p>
					A common concern with teachers who receive instruction in technology is that they 
					are unable to connect what they learn to their classroom setting. This is particularly 
					the case when the instruction is in a generic instructional technology course rather 
					than one specifically for language teaching. One way to make this connection is 
					through situated learning(Lave & Wenger, 1991), where the context of the classroom 
					is taken into account during the teacher’s educational process. In this way the 
					connections between the skills and knowledge being taught and their eventual

				<p>
					realization is made clear. Using technology in a situated way can allow teachers with 
					nascent CALL awareness to develop competence within specific contexts (Kessler 
					& Plakans, 2008). Egbert (2006) shows how this can be put into practice through 
					an online learning course in CALL and through the use of cases. Egbert’s cases are 
					somewhat similar to the vignettes that appear in this book.
				</p>

			</section> <!-- Section 3 -->

			<section class="subsection" data-number="4" data-name="Reflective learning">

				<h4>
					Reflective learning
				</h4>

				<p>
					Reflectivity is a common theme throughout much of the literature on technology and 
					teacher education. This can appear in any of a number of ways—reflective reports, 
					class discussions, online discussion boards, and portfolios with annotated work. 
					Slaouti & Motteram (2006) focus on the transformative nature of reflective learning 
					in a CALL course. They note how the reflective process leads to reconstruction of 
					knowledge from their course, personalization of the material, and the experience. 
					Reflective learning is particularly appropriate for in-service education. Practicing 
					teachers have the potential to make immediate connections between what they learn 
					in a technology-focused course or workshop and how they may be able to use that 
					information in a class they are currently teaching.
				</p>

			</section> <!-- Section 4 -->

			<section class="subsection" data-number="5" data-name="Project-based learning">

				<h4>
					Project-based learning
				</h4>

				<p>
					Technology in language teaching and learning has both a knowledge base and a skill 
					base, as can be seen in the standards themselves and especially in the performance 
					indicators. Using projects as a basis for learning can provide a much richer and more 
					lasting impression of the requisite knowledge and skills than a traditional lecture/
					discussion model. Even in a hands-on setting such as a lab-based course, a project 
					provides a coherent context to aid in retention. Further, if the project has practical 
					value for the instructor beyond the course, it is likely to have a positive impact 
					on motivation. Debski (2006) provides an example of project-based learning in a 
					CALL course at the University of Melbourne. Students there developed a website to 
					prepare visitors from Japan for their cultural experience in Australia. Debski draws 
					its theoretical underpinning from the constructionist theory of Papert (1980) (a 
					product-based variant of constructivism). Chao (2006) discusses using a WebQuest as 
					the central project. 
				</p>

				<p>
					In addition to the three preceding concepts, it is important to consider technology 
					training for language learning from the perspective of the roles the participants in 
					the course may be playing. This is captured in a framework for CALL education 
					proposed by Hubbard and Levy (2006b). The framework distinguishes technical 
					and pedagogical domains for both knowledge and skills (alternatively, declarative 
					and procedural knowledge) across two dimensions. The first of these, institutional 
					roles, refers to one’s actual or perceived position within an organization. It 
					distinguishes pre-service and in-service teachers but also adds the advanced practice 
					categories of <em>specialist</em> and <em>professional</em>. The former is defined in terms of having deep 
					knowledge and an elaborated skill set within one or more areas. The latter refers to 
					an individual whose professional career is to a significant degree defined in terms 
					of broad and deep expertise in technology and language learning (see Hubbard,

				<p>
					2009b, for a discussion of educating CALL specialists). These categories of specialist 
					and professional are captured to some degree in the performance indicators for the 
					“expert level” provided in the standards. Although institutional roles are relatively 
					static at least in the short term, functional roles vary constantly, even within the 
					space of a single classroom session. The four functional roles in this framework are 
					practitioner, developer, researcher, and trainer. These four roles come into play even 
					at the level of the classroom teacher. A classroom teacher may be expected to teach 
					using technology (practitioner), create or adapt technology-based tasks or activities 
					(developer), review student performance and revise practice accordingly (researcher, 
					especially action researcher), and teach students the necessary technical and strategic 
					skills to use the technology effectively on their own (trainer).
				</p>

				<p>
					The following section will discuss several alternative models for educating language 
					teachers about technology that can be used individually or in combination in order 
					to meet the performance indicators of the TESOL Technology Standards. Whatever 
					model or combination is selected, consideration should be given to incorporating 
					aspects of situatedness, reflection, and project-based learning. Attention should be 
					paid also to addressing the range of functional and in some cases institutional roles 
					that the participants may be expected to play in the future.

			<h3>
				Methodology and Models
			</h3>

			<p>
				A number of possible models are available to draw from when embarking on 
				either creating a new course or revising a current one. The key is to ensure that the 
				participants meet or exceed the standards for the educational environment in which 
				the course is embedded as well as that in which the participants may ultimately be 
				teaching. From the perspective of the standards, the goal is the same: 
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					to	provide	teachers	with	a	wide	range	of	knowledge	regarding	their	options;
				</li>

				<li>
					to	give	them	experience	in	choosing	among	those	options,	making	effective
					use of technology in English language instruction and learning tasks and 
					activities; and 
				</li>

				<li>
					to	learn	how	to	support	students	when	appropriate	in	meeting	the
					learner standards. 
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The models discussed here include breadth first, depth first, using technology to teach 
				technology, collaborative learning, communities of practice, and self-directed learning 
				(see Hubbard, 2008; Kessler, in press). While all of these are possible in a pre-service 
				setting, the last three are particularly well-suited to the practical limitations of many 
				in-service teachers, for whom extended formal education opportunities may be 
				limited. The section concludes with advice for educators on supporting ongoing 
				professional development.

			<section class="subsection" data-number="7" data-name="Breadth first">

<!-- Page 147 -->
			
				<h4>
					Breadth first
				</h4>

				<p>
					One common approach can be referred to as “breadth first.” This is typical of a 
					survey course for technology in language learning and is the type supported by most 
					introductory textbooks in the field (see the Resources section). An advantage of 
					breadth first is that teacher candidates are exposed to a wide range of options they 
					might otherwise be unfamiliar with. In principle, teacher candidates can then select 
					among the options in an informed manner. A potential disadvantage is that teacher 
					candidates may spend time learning about technologies and activities that are not 
					immediately relevant to them and thus may be easily forgotten once the course 
					has ended.
				</p>

			</section> <!-- Section 7 -->

			<section class="subsection" data-number="8" data-name="Depth first">

				<h4>
					Depth first
				</h4>

				<p>
					An alternative to breadth first is a depth-first approach. Here, teachers learn about 
					a much narrower range of options but have the opportunity to explore them in 
					greater detail. An example of a depth-first course can be found in Chao (2006). Chao 
					describes a class centered on building a WebQuest, a learning task in which students 
					search online for content in the target language that is connected with meeting a goal 
					or solving a problem. During this class, teachers learned a variety of technology skills 
					associated with creating the WebQuest and accompanying lessons. The depth-first 
					approach may be particularly useful for shorter, in-service training or when dealing 
					with teachers whose technology skills are limited. The depth-first approach may 
					provide a strong introduction to the use of technology in English language teaching. 
					However, it will be necessary to complement such a course with additional training to 
					meet many of the performance indicators in the teacher standards.
				</p>

			</section> <!-- Section 8 -->

			<section class="subsection" data-number="9" data-name="Using technology to teach technology">

				<h4>
					Using technology to teach technology
				</h4>

				<p>
					Using technology to teach about the use of technology is an effective way of 
					building teacher confidence, either during a dedicated technology course or as an 
					accompaniment to some other course. This practice allows teachers with emerging 
					abilities to experience the use of the technology firsthand as they discuss its potential 
					in the language classroom. This is of necessity the case with online teacher training 
					courses. In online courses, Teacher Goal 4 Standard 1 regarding communication 
					technologies is an integral part of the course structure. When teachers receive some 
					or all of their instruction through technology, they experience what it is like to 
					learn rather than simply teach with technology. This exposure makes them more 
					comfortable with using the devices and infrastructure. Using technology in the course 
					also provides teacher educators with the opportunity to ensure that candidates meet 
					the learner standards on their way to mastering the teacher standards. The TESOL 
					Online Certificate Program similarly uses an online setting to help teachers make the 
					transition from the classroom to online teaching. For those contemplating a move 
					from classroom to online teacher education, Bauer-Ramazani (2006) describes some 
					of the challenges involved in moving a technology for language teaching course 
					online. These include scheduling, differing levels of technology proficiency among 
					the students, resource limitations, and additional expenditures of time on the part of 
					both instructor and students.

			<section class="subsection" data-number="10" data-name="Collaborative learning">

<!-- Page 148 -->

				<h4>
					Collaborative learning
				</h4>

				<p>
					Collaborative learning represents another option around which to structure all or 
					part of a course. The value of collaborative learning is well established for language 
					learners, but it is also a valuable approach for technology education for teachers. 
					Working collaboratively has the potential to improve motivation, especially in 
					teachers who have limited experience with technology or lack confidence in using it 
					in their teaching. As noted in Debski (2006), it is also the case that teams working 
					collaboratively on a technology project can learn from the expertise of individual 
					members in specific areas. Arnold, Ducate, and Lomicka (2007) present an example 
					of collaborative learning in an online setting involving three graduate classes at 
					two universities. 
				</p>

			</section> <!-- Section 10 -->

			<section class="subsection" data-number="11" data-name="Communities of practice">

				<h4>
					Communities of practice
				</h4>

				<p>
					So far the discussion has focused on approaches that can take place within formal 
					structures. However, a further role of teacher educators in supporting learning 
					and maintaining the technology standards is to provide teachers with the tools 
					for continuing their development after the course is over. Following the theme 
					of collaborative learning, one such approach is through communities of practice 
					(Wenger, 1998). In this case, communities of practice (CoPs) are groups of 
					individuals who share information and support and learn from one another as they 
					develop their professional competence in using technology for language teaching. In 
					fact, Arnold et al. (2007) suggest that their collaborative approach included many of 
					the characteristics ascribed to CoPs, though missing a couple of key ones: voluntary 
					participation and longevity. Hanson-Smith (2006) provides an overview of CoPs 
					for teachers using and learning about technology for their language courses. Among 
					other groups, she mentions Webheads in Action, a group that describes itself as a 
					“worldwide, cross-cultural, and vibrant online community of educators with an open 
					enrollment for anyone who wants to join” (2010; http://www.webheadsinaction.org
					/about: para. 1).

			<section class="subsection" data-number="12" data-name="Self-directed learning">

				<h4>
					Self-directed learning
				</h4>

				<p>
					In addition to CoPs, teacher educators can provide experiences and resources that 
					will enable teachers to continue with self-directed learning after the course is over. 
					The need to prepare teachers for ongoing learning is implied in Goal 1 Standard 3, 
					<em>Language teachers actively strive to expand their skill and knowledge base to evaluate, adopt, 
					and adapt emerging technologies throughout their careers</em>.
				</p>

				<p>
					With regard to more formal continuing in-service education, there are other 
					stakeholders beyond individual teacher educators and ESOL teacher education 
					programs. The role of program administrators and other management and policy 
					personnel is spelled out in Chapter 7 of this volume. However, professional 
					organizations have a role to play as well. The impact of the standards will be 
					enhanced to the degree that such organizations encourage workshops and classes 
					to index their content to the standards. A good place to start would be with TESOL’s

			<h3>
				Integrating the Standards Into Teacher Education
			</h3>

			<p>
				The preceding sections in this chapter have provided a rationale for the importance 
				of teacher education in technology for language instruction and learning, discussed 
				some of the theoretical grounding and frameworks, and offered a range of methods 
				and models. This section discusses some of the issues involved in integrating the 
				standards into pre-service and in-service teacher education programs. The first task 
				for both the learner and teacher standards focuses on technical knowledge and skills, 
				areas covered by Goal 1 Standard 1. Although some teachers enter a teacher education 
				program or other professional course relatively strong in this area, many do not. 
				Further, there are likely to be gaps in knowledge and skills similar to those found by 
				Winke & Goertler (2008) for foreign language students. 
			</p>

			<p>
				As reported in Hubbard (2008), the majority of MA TESOL programs in the United 
				States and Canada did not offer dedicated technology training courses. Many of 
				the programs that did have technology training courses left them as electives. This 
				suggests that the technology training, if it occurred at all, often took place during 
				the latter part of the program—after required course work had been completed. 
				Hegelheimer (2006) reports on an alternative, a curriculum-wide approach in 
				a master’s program. This model is based on the notion that beginning with a 
				required technology course offers graduate students a common foundation that 
				can be exploited by instructors in succeeding classes. In his course, students work 
				on advanced search and computer-based presentational skills; learn to use course 
				management tools, quiz generation programs, and screen-capturing applications; 
				create a professional home page; use spreadsheets for descriptive statistics; and 
				understand language corpora and concordancing programs. Such a foundation in 
				the early stages could have positive consequences for teacher education program 
				outcomes. Regardless of how and when technology expertise is provided during a 
				pre-service program, the core of Goal 1 should be attained: <em>Language teachers acquire 
				and maintain foundational knowledge and skills in technology for professional purposes</em>.The 
				infrastructure for meeting this goal is more of a challenge for in-service settings. Still, 
				in-service teacher educators can address this target and make significant progress, 
				especially with the support of administrators. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Beyond Goal 1, the remainder of the teacher standards should be addressed in a
				preservice program in ways that (a) persuade teacher candidates of the value of various 
				technology applications, activities, and tasks for language teaching and learning; and 
				(b) demonstrate to them that technology will be a significant aspect of their teaching 
				throughout their careers. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In the first case, that means it is incumbent upon the teacher education program 
				to show that the use of technology in certain circumstancesmakes language learning 
				“better.” Hubbard (2009a) claims that assessing improvements in language

			<p>
				learning when using technology from the learner’s perspective involves the 
				following dimensions:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					learning	efficiency:	learners	are	able	to	pick	up	language	knowledge	or	skills
					faster or with less effort;
				</li>

				<li>
					learning	effectiveness:	learners	retain	language	knowledge	or	skills	longer,
					make deeper associations, and/or learn more of what they need;
				</li>

				<li>
					access:	learners	can	get	materials	or	experience	interactions	that	would
					otherwise be difficult or impossible to get or do;
				</li>

				<li>
					convenience:	learners	can	study	and	practice	with	equal	effectiveness	across	a
					wider range of times and places; 
				</li>

				<li>
					motivation:	learners	enjoy	the	language	learning	process	more	and	thus
					engage more fully;
				</li>

				<li>
					institutional	efficiency:	learners	require	less	teacher	time	or	fewer	or	less
					expensive resources. (pp. 1–2)
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Although making such assessments convincingly is often not feasible, the literature 
				on computer-assisted language learning includes empirical research in these areas to 
				support teacher decision-making (see Chapter 2 of this volume). Introducing teacher 
				candidates to such research and to sources for obtaining additional findings is in line 
				with Goal 2 Standard 4: <em>Language teachers use relevant research findings to inform the 
				planning of language learning activities and tasks that involve technology</em>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The second point is the notion that technology use for language teaching and 
				learning will continue and almost certainly expand and change radically during 
				the ensuing decades of a newly minted professional teacher’s career. This means 
				that teacher education programs not only need to teach to the goals and standards 
				relevant to current technology options, they must provide teachers with the tools and 
				experiences to enable continuing professional growth. Goal 1 Standard 3 addresses 
				this explicitly with respect to the technologies: <em>Language teachers actively strive to 
				expand their skill and knowledge base to evaluate, adopt, and adapt emerging technologies 
				throughout their careers</em>. This same philosophy indirectly permeates the remaining 
				three goals. Teacher education programs have a responsibility to create a culture of 
				lifelong learning that will help their candidates weather not only the rapid shifts in 
				technology but also the likely pedagogical changes that will occur in their future, 
				including new pedagogies that may incorporate technology as a central actor in 
				their theoretical underpinnings. The bleak alternative is a potential fossilization of 
				technology use and pedagogical practice in teachers, frozen in the time frame of their 
				formal teacher training. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Teacher standards are not the only concern of teacher educators: Learner standards 
				as well should be addressed. The place of the learner standards in teacher education 
				programs is likely to be highly variable due to the wide range of settings in which 
				teacher candidates may ultimately find themselves. However, in addition to fulfilling

				the teacher standards themselves, many teachers will also have some degree of 
				responsibility in ensuring that their students meet some or all of the learner 
				standards. This responsibility will vary significantly depending on the institutional 
				setting, the objectives of the course the teacher will be leading, and the technology 
				preparation of the students. These may be unknowable for many teacher candidates 
				in pre-service programs. Therefore, some consideration should be given to preparing 
				teacher candidates for flexibility in the trainer role with respect to the learner 
				standards. An option here is to have teachers individually or in small groups learn 
				specific technology applications for language learning in line with Teacher Goal 2, 
				for example, and then instruct their classmates in how to use them. In this way the 
				teachers can rehearse the trainer role in a systematic way prior to working with their 
				language students. To accommodate this need, not only should teacher educators 
				be responsible for knowing all the teacher standards in order to prepare teachers 
				effectively, but they should also be familiar with the learner standards and how both 
				sets of standards would likely impact various learning environments.

				Finally, at the administrative level within language teacher education programs, 
				thought must be given to how the overall curriculum will accommodate the 
				technology standards. Besides determining which model or models to use (breadth 
				first, depth first, etc.), there is a question of whether to incorporate dedicated 
				technology courses, to integrate technology more seamlessly throughout the program, 
				or to use a combination of the two. As technology works its way into all areas of 
				education, it seems unlikely that a stand-alone course with no further thought 
				given to technology integration will be a useful long-term solution. On the other 
				hand, providing the appropriate depth to meet Goal 1 will be challenging if the 
				responsibility is distributed throughout a range of courses and instructors.

				At the time of this writing there is no formal way of externally certifying compliance 
				with the TESOL Technology Standards. However, it would arguably be to the benefit 
				of both the teacher education program and the graduating teacher candidates 
				if some form of documentation could be provided. One approach would be to 
				create a concordance table across required and elective courses that showed where 
				specific standards were being addressed. Another would be to assist teachers in 
				creating a structured electronic portfolio containing course work and projects (both 
				individual and collaborative) that could be cross-referenced to specific standards 
				and performance indicators. The program assessment component of Chapter 9 in 
				this volume will be helpful in that effort. As the standards become established, more 
				formal mechanisms may be made available for demonstrating that teachers have 
				met them.

			<p>
				This chapter has provided an overview of issues and options in educating language 
				teachers in using technology effectively in their classrooms. It has emphasized the 
				responsibility of both teacher educators and the programs in which they may be 
				housed to incorporate the TESOL Technology Standards into their offerings in a

				systematic way. Regardless of whether one is reviewing an individual course or an 
				entire program, a reasonable place to start would be to use the standards as a tool 
				for evaluating current offerings. Is there a course or courses in which particular 
				standards are being addressed? If so, which of the performance indicators are built 
				into assessments for those courses? What strengths and gaps does this evaluation 
				illuminate, and how could the gaps be addressed? Finally, what kinds of educational 
				options can be set up to accommodate the large number of currently practicing 
				ESOL teachers who either have no technology training or whose training may need 
				refreshing? Although the challenges facing teacher educators and programs seeking 
				to integrate the technology standards into their curricula may be significant, avoiding 
				those challenges is no longer an option.

				Resources

			<p>				
				There have been at least two edited volumes specifically on the topic of technology and language teacher 
				education (Hubbard & Levy, 2006b; Kassen, Lavine, Murphy-Judy & Peters, 2007) as well as special issues 
				of the journals <em>Language Learning & Technology</em> (2002) and <em>Innovation
				in Language Learning and Teaching</em>(2009).
			</p>

			<p>
				Additionally, teacher educators can benefit from a number of useful books that serve as either classroom 
				texts or valuable references to technology and language learning (e.g., Beatty, 2003; Blake,
				2008; ButlerPascoe & Wiburg, 2003; de Szendeffy, 2005; Ducate & Arnold, 2006; Egbert, 2005;
				Egbert & HansonSmith, 2007; Fotos & Browne, 2004; Hanson-Smith & Rilling, 2007; Levy & Stockwell, 2006).

				Teacher educators more centrally involved with technology should be aware of the professional 
				organizations dedicated to this field. These include the Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) 
				and Video and Digital Media (VDM) interest sections of TESOL (http://www.tesol.org),
				the ComputerAssisted Language Instruction Consortium (CALICO; http://www.calico.org), the International 
				Association of Language Learning Technologies (http://www.iallt.org), the European Association for 
				Computer-Assisted Language Learning (http://www.eurocall-languages.org), the Pacific Association 
				for Computer-Assisted Language Learning (http://www.paccall.org), and the Asia Pacific Association for 
				Computer-Assisted Language Learning (http://www.apacall.org).
