			</h2>

			<h2>
				Checklists for Self-Assessment and Program Assessment
			</h2>

			<p class="chapterSummary">
				“Can-do” checklists are provided for both the learner standards and the 
				teacher standards. The program assessment rubric is a way to examine 
				compliance at the institutional or program level.
			</p>

			<p>
				This chapter is designed for those who want to evaluate themselves and their 
				programs against the TESOL Technology Standards. Teachers should use the 
				Technology Standards for Language Teachers Rubric to look at their own skills and 
				use the Technology Standards for Language Learners Rubric to assess how well they 
				are enabling their students’ use of technology. Having read Chapter 6, Implications 
				and Recommendations for Teacher Educators, teacher educators will want to ensure 
				that their graduates are able to meet all elements in the Technology Standards 
				for Language Teachers Rubric. Administrators will wish to look at the Program 
				Assessment Rubric, as well as the Technology Standards for Language Learners 
				Rubric, the Technology Standards for Language Teachers Rubric, and the guidelines in 
				Chapter 7, Administrators and the Technology Standards.
