			<h2>
				Technology Standards for Language Learners
			</h2>

			<p class="chapterSummary">
				This chapter presents four overarching goals and a total of 14 
				standards. Each standard includes performance indicators and at least 
				one vignette. Some of the standards include additional performance 
				indicators to distinguish expert-level skills. As in the learner section, the 
				vignettes pertain to a range of settings and learner types.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Technology Standards for Language Teachers consist of four overarching 
				goals, each with three or four standards. Each of the 14 standards is accompanied 
				by 5–11 performance indicators. As in the learner standards, the teacher goals 
				and standards are not listed hierarchically or sequentially; each standard is 
				independently important.
			</p>

			<p>
				The performance indicators in the teacher section indicate standards that all teachers 
				should meet. Some of the standards include additional performance indicators 
				for technology experts. These teachers have a high level of technological ability, 
				experience, and pedagogical knowledge. Teachers serving as technology specialists 
				should be able to meet the expert performance indicators in settings that rely heavily 
				on technology.
			</p>

			<p>
				This chapter includes one or two vignettes for each standard. The vignettes are 
				designed to demonstrate how the standards are applied in real contexts and 
				to encourage appropriate use of technology by teachers, teacher educators, 
				administrators, and others. Each vignette includes examples of how the standard is 
				applied in low-resource, low-access; medium-resource, medium-access; and highresource,
				high-access settings. Across the standards, the vignettes cover a wide range 
				of teacher and learner types and settings. Some of the vignettes in the teacher section 
				show administrators, teacher educators, and fully online teachers making decisions 
				related to technology use. To be as immediately useful as possible, the vignettes 
				include examples of current technology applications and websites, as well as reference 
				to recent articles on the pedagogies involved. The vignettes included here do not, of 
				course, illustrate all the possible ways in which the standards can be applied.

			<p>
				Every effort has been made to represent different teacher populations (e.g., teachers of 
				young learners, teacher trainers, tertiary language teachers). Most teachers, as well as 
				teacher educators and administrators, will find vignettes in which they will recognize 
				themselves and their context. We hope this familiarity will help make the standards 
				more meaningful. At the same time, educators should imagine how these practices 
				can enrich their own. Although not all vignettes will be relevant to every educator, we 
				believe that they will still enable the visualization of the performance indicators and 
				offer ideas that can easily be transferred to other contexts.
			</p>

				Each vignette is labeled with the following:

			<table class="teacherProfile">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>
							Teacher profile:

				We encourage those who are working with technology in various contexts to continue 
				to contribute their own vignettes to help expand the knowledge base available to 
				educators. Follow the vignettes provided in this book as a template for organizing

				<h6>
					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					A teacher works in a state school that is implementing the CLIL (content and 
					language integrated learning) approach in order to improve the EFL learning 
					environment of young primary school students. The instructor teaches in the foreign 
					language to very young children who are just beginning to learn that language, but 
					their school has a rather limited range of foreign language resources. The teacher uses 
					technology to enhance their classroom in various ways. For example, CDs or DVDs 
					provide the children with more linguistic and content input. The children sometimes 
					gather around the computer to view a story or animated song, and they sometimes 
					interact with animated storybooks and interactive CDs or DVDs in the English corner 
					at the back of their classroom.
				</p>

				<p>
					Often the teacher cannot find print materials, and so uses copyright-free pictures 
					downloaded at home and transferred with a memory device to the class computer. 
					The teacher pastes the pictures into presentation software to create visually enhanced 
					presentations for the class. The children then sit in their chairs in a circle around the 
					computer and view and discuss the presentation.
				</p>

				<p>
					The teacher organizes the materials in folders, exchanges materials with an email 
					group of local colleagues, and often downloads flash cards or creates board games 
					and card games from teacher resource websites such as Tools for Educators (2010, 
					http://www.toolsforeducators.com) or DLTK’s Educational Activities for Children 
					(DLTK’s Sites, 2010, http://www.dltk-teach.com). The teacher also frequently visits 
					resource sites such as A to Z Teacher Stuff (2010, http://www.atozteacherstuff.com) to 
					find lesson plans and ideas for the class.
				</p>

				<p>
					Finally, in order to create authentic and stimulating contexts for the students and 
					also to involve parents, the teacher sometimes video records students’ role-plays of 
					various songs or just the children singing a song or narrating a story. The teacher then 
					prepares CDs or DVDs with the material and sends it home—or, if the parents give 
					their permission, uploads it to the school or community website.

					Technology Tasks
				</h6>

				<h5>
					Low-resource, low-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					In a classroom with one computer but no projector or Internet, the teacher prepares 
					materials at home. To teach the story Brown Bear, Brown Bear(Martin & Carle, 1967, 
					1970), the teacher looks for ideas at educational resource websites and downloads 
					flash cards from ESL Flashcards (ESLflashcards.com, 2010, http://www.eslflashcards
					.com) to help with introducing the new vocabulary. The teacher does not have a big 
					book to present the story to the class, and so scans the pictures from the book or uses 
					similar pictures from DLTK’s Sites (2010) Crafts for Kids to create a slide presentation. 
					The teacher uses the slides like a book, changing them as if turning the pages of the 
					book, while the children sit around the computer as the story is read aloud to them.
				</p>

				<p>
					Next, the teacher gives the children a handout prepared with the various pictures 
					from the story. The children cut out the pictures and place them in the right order. 
					At the end of the lesson, the children sing the story to the tune of a familiar song 
					(e.g., “Frère Jacques”). Later, during free activity time, the children can practice 
					the new vocabulary by playing card games or a board game, which the teacher has 
					prepared with the help of materials downloaded from Tools for Educators. In the 
					follow-up lesson, the teacher video records the children singing the song in order to 
					put the recording in their portfolios and on a CD or DVD that the children will take 
					home at the end of the term.
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					In a classroom with a computer for every three students, a projector, and some Internet 
					access, the teacher carries out the lesson as described previously but with the children 
					following the story with the help of the projector. The teacher might also use animal 
					sounds from the Internet (e.g., from Sea World’s Animal Sounds Library, SeaWorld 
					Parks & Entertainment, 2010, http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/sound-library
					/index.htm ) so that the children can listen to and identify animal sounds.
				</p>

				<p>
					During their free activity time, the children can draw the animals from the story 
					using Paint or other drawing software, work on interactive CDs or DVDs, or view 
					a presentation of the story with narration recorded by the teacher to supplement 
					the visuals.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the follow-up lesson, the teacher records the children narrating parts of the story 
					on an MP3 device. The teacher then uses the audio recordings and the children’s 
					drawings with a video editor (e.g., Windows Movie Maker [Microsoft, 2004] or 
					iMovie [Apple Computer, 2009]) in order to create a digital video presentation in 
					which the children narrate the story. The presentation is included in the children’s 
					portfolio and copied on a CD/DVD that the children can take home at the end of the 
					term. The teacher also uploads the presentation, after obtaining parents’ permission, 
					on the school or community website.

					High-resource, high-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					In a classroom with one computer, a projector, and a good Internet connection, 
					the lesson can be carried out as previously descibed. In the follow-up lesson, the 
					teacher can record individual students or student pairs narrating their favorite 
					parts of the story using Voki (Oddcast, 2010; http://www.voki.com/) or a similar 
					program, in which the students can choose a personalized avatar. The students 
					choose their favorite avatar and then record their narration. The teacher uploads the 
					recording to the school or community website. Although Voki provides safety for 
					the children, because their images are not shown online, the teacher still asks for 
					parents’ permission before uploading and sends an informative leaflet to parents 
					detailing how Voki will be used. The teacher also invites the parents to watch the Voki 
					presentations and give feedback to their children.

				<h6>
					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					An experienced teacher who uses technology in language courses has been asked to 
					provide an introduction to CALL for other teachers at their university. The teacher 
					often uses productivity software, such as a word processor for writing reports, 
					spreadsheets for maintaining a grade book, a presentation program for projects, 
					and email software at home. Thus, the teacher is familiar with basic functions 
					such as turning devices on and off, opening and closing files and folders, using 
					search mechanisms, and launching and exiting software and a browser. To prepare 
					for teaching a CALL course to colleagues, the teacher visits with the university 
					instructional technology department to ensure familiarity with how computers work 
					in the lab (e.g., how to access the Internet or local intranet, and what software will be 
					available for the class). Well in advance of the first day, the teacher requests that audio 
					technology be installed, and the university agrees to supply several computer stations 
					in the lab with headsets and appropriate software. The university technology support 
					professionals also demonstrate the assistive computer devices that are available 
					for students with disabilities. The teacher practices plugging in the equipment and 
					adjusting it in preparation for showing the teachers how to use it. Where an intranet 
					or Internet access is available, the teacher also requests university server space to 
					create an online forum where teachers (and later their students) can write about their 
					projects and ask questions about their work. The teacher communicates regularly 
					with individual colleagues. One or more of the workshops focuses on technology 
					safety, for example, setting computer or Internet passwords, avoiding giving out 
					personal information, using virus-checking software, and determining the reliability 
					of information collected on the web. The teacher reminds colleagues that when they 
					supplement their computer work at home or in an Internet café, they should viruscheck
					their portable devices before loading files onto the school’s computers.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the course of the school term, the new teacher-trainer asks colleagues to complete 
					several different kinds of projects directly related to their work, depending on the 
					technology available to them. These include a team presentation using slideshow 
					software to examine pedagogical aspects of some software or Internet sites, for 
					example, how to use a word processor for pedagogical purposes, a project requiring 
					a web search for images and text, a podcast audio recording, a collage using an

					online graphics program, a review of a CALL lesson website or lesson software, or 
					a WebQuest, based on their own interests and access to technology. Colleagues are 
					also asked to create an online or paper rubric to evaluate each other’s projects as 
					well as their own (see PBL Checklists [ALTEC, University of Kansas, 2009], http://
					pblchecklist.4teachers.org/checklist.shtml). They collect all their projects in an 
					electronic portfolio. These projects represent the types of activities the teachers may 
					require of their own future students, and they give ample practice in basic file and 
					computer management while using typical CALL productivity tools and teaching 
					software. As the semester progresses, the teachers begin working collaboratively on 
					specific activities, handouts, website links, and so on, that they will use with their 
					own students. By the beginning of the semester in which they will use the lab, all the 
					teachers have completed a set of materials to help students access the lab for language 
					learning and have helped archive them for others to use as well. (For online courses 
					for professional development, see TESOL’s Online Education Programs [TESOL, 
					2010], http://tesol.org/s_tesol/seccss.asp?CID=244&DID=1716; and TESOL CALL

					Low-resource, low-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With only one or two computers in the classroom and no Internet access, teachers 
					work in teams, taking turns, and they supplement their work with a home computer 
					or at a public Internet café or community center. The teacher–trainer brings printouts 
					of web pages to class as exemplars and creates folders on the class computer to hold 
					the teams’ electronic portfolios. Teachers use printouts of the presentations and other 
					activities they have created, and they use home or public computers to download and 
					save the web pages onto portable devices to bring to the classroom. Portable media 
					are virus-checked before copies are made to the classroom machine. These activities 
					give the teachers ample practice in overcoming the limitations of their setting and in 
					practicing safe computing while they prepare classroom materials.
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With a small lab with headsets and modest Internet access, teachers are able to 
					complete all the suggested activities more easily. The teacher–trainer helps them 
					create a checkout system so their students will be able to borrow and return the 
					headsets. The teachers supplement their work with a home computer or at a public 
					Internet café or community center, either sending files to themselves for download 
					at the lab or saving them to a portable device to bring to the university. The teacher–
					trainer regularly accesses the online forum or a virtual office space such as Tapped 
					In ([SRI, 2010] http://www.tappedin.org), either from home or at school, in order to 
					motivate the teachers to complete their tasks.
				</p>

				<h5>
					High-resource, high-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With several university labs, broadband Internet access, and a computer/projector 
					set up in the classroom, teachers are able to use open lab times to access the 
					forum, email, and a virtual office space (e.g., Tapped In), and they complete their 
					projects using the Internet. The teacher–trainer uses the projector to demonstrate

					how the projects will be shaped and provides examples of websites to visit for 
					their pedagogical studies. Online lessons are sampled by everyone in the lab, with 
					comments from the whole class at the discussion forum, before teachers begin their 
					reviews. The teachers save their reviews of websites and software in a wiki set up by 
					the trainer; this archive will help remind them of the content when they begin to use 
					the Internet with their own students. The teachers are encouraged to set up their own 
					virtual offices and to create links to websites and downloadable materials that they 
					can begin using immediately with their own students.

					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					A native-English-speaking (NES) teacher’s aide in a small provincial center has been 
					tasked with helping the nonnative-English-speaking (NNES) teacher implement 
					more communication practice in a high-intermediate EFL class by drawing on 
					different types of technology support. Although a native speaker of English, the 
					aide has not had pedagogical training. The nonnative speaker is a former teacher 
					of another language. While possessing a strong understanding of pedagogy and 
					English grammar, the teacher lacks confidence in speaking skills and so is reluctant 
					to introduce speaking and pronunciation activities into class. The NNES teacher 
					is familiar with basic word processing and Internet search skills and has used 
					technology to support students’ reading and writing skills, but is now interested 
					in learning to use technology to support students’ listening and speaking skills. 
					The teacher and the aide analyze the language objectives for the upcoming unit 
					and discuss the range of choices available for students who have various levels of 
					familiarity with technology. As they try out several of their ideas over a six-week 
					period, the teacher and the aide meet regularly to discuss the challenges and successes 
					of each of the technology supports. The teacher suggests that they write a blog to 
					share their insights with colleagues. (For more on developing listening–speaking 
					skills, see Barrett, 2007.)

				<p>
					In a classroom with no computer, the teacher has a laptop and occasional Internet 
					access outside the school setting. Many of the students at the school have small, 
					inexpensive MP3 players with recording capability, so the teacher’s aide encourages 
					the use of these mobile devices for language practice. The NNES teacher decides to 
					create dialogues that the students can practice and record in pairs or small groups. 
					The teacher has written the dialogues and so can listen to the responses with a fair 
					amount of confidence. Once the students’ dialogues have been submitted, the teacher 
					and the aide listen to them together via audio editing software, such as Audacity

					(downloadable free at http://www.audacity.com), on a laptop. By using Audacity they 
					can isolate particular pronunciation issues and suggest audio corrections to give back 
					to the students. Working together in this way also gives the NNES teacher fluency

					In a classroom with a computer and projector, the teacher and aide have been looking 
					at how suprasegmentals and word linking can be used to boost student speaking 
					speed. The students are fans of karaoke, so the teachers decide to work with the 
					idea of “movie karaoke.” They select several movies and use an Internet search or 
					transcription to find and print out the dialogue of individual scenes. In class, they 
					play a movie scene (on DVD, if the Internet is not available) and the class watches 
					without scripts. The class watches and listens to the scene a second time while 
					following along with a script. For the third viewing, the class is encouraged to read 
					aloud with the actors on screen. Finally, the teacher asks for volunteers to come to 
					the front of the class to be the voices of the actors on screen; they read the script with 
					the sound turned off in the video, mimicking the body language and gestures of the 
					actors as they recite the dialogue. The teacher ends the class with a native-language 
					lecture on how words are linked in English. With this new understanding of linking, 
					the next class is devoted to further movie karaoke and practice.

				<p>
					In a computer lab with 10 computers and reliable Internet access, students have access 
					to digital cameras or video cameras. In a unit focusing on the future tense, the teacher 
					seeks to incorporate more speaking practice for the students and has considered 
					working with the weather. The aide suggests they visit a weather forecast site, such 
					as The Weather Channel ([Weather Channel Interactive, 2010] http://www.weather
					.com), and prepare questions for the class that will require the use of the future 
					forms. In class, students work in pairs to view the weather forecast site for various 
					locales, including their own; students are asked to note down the weather for the 
					coming week and take notes answering the questions. They take turns responding 
					orally to the questions in a whole-class discussion. For homework, the student 
					pairs go outside and use their cameras to shoot a weather report for the coming 
					week where they use the future tense terminology learned that week. The student 
					pairs report back, showing their forecasts and evaluating each other’s reports. The 
					teacher and the aide later review the students’ productions together, making recorded 
					comments and isolating dominant pronunciation issues for each student.

				<h6>
					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					As part of in-service training, a secondary ESL teacher attends a TESOL online 
					conference focused on implementing the TESOL PreK-12 standards in the classroom. 
					Because the conference did not focus specifically on technology implementation, the 
					teacher decides to explore how technology is used in teaching languages by reading 
					articles in practitioner journals related to teaching with technology (e.g., <em>Language 
					Learning & Technology</em>, http://llt.msu.edu/; and the TESOL Journal, 2010, http://www
					.tesol.org ->Publications >TESOL Journal, free to members online). The teacher 
					also joins a community of practice mentioned at the conference. Online colleagues 
					encourage the teacher to try new technologies and offer their classes for learning 
					partners. The teacher decides that summary writing is an area in the curriculum that 
					would benefit from technology implementation and digital media. The curriculum 
					has a strong focus on expository writing because students must learn how to read 
					complex texts in their content-area classes, such as science, social studies, and 
					language arts. However, the students are not typically motivated to read in depth, and 
					they find the task of summarizing laborious. The teacher decides to have students 
					create nonfiction picture books about their topic for an audience of a partnered 
					elementary class offered by a colleague from the online community of practice who 
					teaches at a nearby school. 
				</p>

				<p>
					In this activity, the secondary school students must read, process, and organize 
					information from complex texts that extend topics they are learning in their contentarea
					classes. They then use summaries of the content to create books appropriate to 
					the elementary class audience. The teacher first meets with each of the content-area 
					teachers who express an interest in the project to develop a set of appropriate 
					materials and a list of websites where students can conduct research on a topic that 
					interests them and relates to content they are studying in one of their core classes. 
					The teacher also arranges with the partnering elementary classroom teacher for 
					the secondary students to read their books to the younger students. In this way, 
					the teacher provides the older students with opportunities to demonstrate their 
					understanding of a content-area topic of their choice in the context of practicing their 
					expository writing for an authentic audience. At the conclusion of the project, the 
					teacher discusses the shared successes and problems with the partner teacher and with 
					the online community of practice, who share their ideas for improvement. (For more 
					on project-based learning, see Boss and Kraus, 2007.)

					Technology Tasks
				</h6>

				<h5>
					Low-resource, low-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With only one or two computers in the classroom and no Internet access, the 
					secondary teacher develops a collection of CD-ROM materials downloaded from 
					the Internet or found in relevant books and journals related to several content-area 
					topics. The students team up in pairs to work on a particular topic of interest. Their 
					task is to locate, read, and organize information about their topic in order to write 
					a nonfiction book for young (7- to 8-year-old) learners. As a whole-class activity, 
					the teacher helps students read and analyze several short nonfiction picture books. 
					They list features of this genre and together create guidelines for what to include in 
					their texts. After breaking into teams and writing their texts, the students take turns 
					at the computer using word-processing software to format their books with different 
					fonts, clip art, color, and their own illustrations made with the computer’s drawing 
					program. The teacher prints the books and puts each one in a spiral binder for the 
					elementary classroom teacher. At the appointed time, the teenage ESL students read 
					their books to the elementary students.
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With a computer lab in the school that has headsets and modest Internet access, 
					the teacher reserves the lab once a week for several weeks so that students can 
					complete the activities suggested in the low-access setting, using CD-ROMs and 
					informational websites that the teacher has previously bookmarked. The students 
					then use a book-making website such as the Stapleless Book ([National Council 
					of Teachers of English, 2010] http://www.readwritethink.org/classroom-resources/
					student-interactives/stapleless-book-30010.html) to create their nonfiction picture 
					books. They use a free recording program such as Audacity (downloadable at http://
					audacity.sourceforge.net) to create audio files after they have practiced reading their 
					texts aloud. They print and send the books and audio files to their partner elementary 
					class. If the partner class is nearby, they also go to the elementary classroom to read 
					aloud, as suggested previously.
				</p>

				<h5>
					High-resource, high-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With broadband Internet access in the lab and a set of digital cameras available 
					for checkout, the teacher has students complete the assignment described in the 
					medium-access setting and also adds an additional layer: the students take turns 
					recording videos of each other reading aloud from their picture books. They discuss 
					features of read-alouds (pace, prosody, gestures, etc.) and develop a rubric for helping 
					each other read well. After practicing under the teacherís guidance, the students take 
					turns reading and video recording alternate pages of the text. Using the computersí 
					video editing software, the students splice together the segments to create a short 
					video clip to post to an education-oriented video site (e.g., TeacherTube [2010], 
					http://www.teachertube.com) so that the partnering teacher can have the elementary 
					students read along with the videos in class. If the partner class is nearby, students 
					also go to the elementary classroom to read aloud, as previously suggested. The 
					videos create a permanent archive that can be used in subsequent years.

				<h6>
					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					A teacher of EFL students seeks to keep abreast of new technologies in the field. The 
					teacher tries to attend conferences whenever possible, but funding for international 
					travel is difficult and local conferences offer few new ideas. To compensate 
					for infrequent travel, the teacher has joined a number of international online 
					communities and special interest sections of English language teachers who are 
					involved with and interested in technology (e.g., TESOL’s CALL Interest Section 
					[2010b], http://www.call-is.org/info/). The teacher has a computer at home, but can 
					also go to local Internet cafés or the local library to access the online discussions of 
					the community via email. When possible, the teacher also participates in synchronous 
					video- or audioconferencing and is regularly involved in interesting discussions 
					evaluating emerging technologies in language learning. The teacher often carries 
					out online research about technologies that seem promising for the local context 
					and tries to find out more about their implementation in language learning and 
					teaching. When possible, the teacher tries to access the specific technologies in order 
					to experiment with them by using them with the online community, colleagues from 
					the local professional association, or colleagues at school.
				</p>

				<p>
					The teacher regularly briefs local colleagues about this work. When trying out a 
					particular technology, the teacher presents it to and discusses it with these colleagues. 
					In situations where a specific technology seems promising for the local context, the 
					teacher prepares a carefully designed trial of implementation with students. In such a 
					case, all the factors relevant to the context must be considered. These include training 
					students, obtaining permissions, and considering time requirements (class length and 
					syllabus fit).
				</p>

				<p>
					The teacher evaluates the implementation and also asks students for their feedback. 
					If the initial implementation brings about positive results and evaluations, and if the 
					technology fits the needs of the students and adds value to their learning situation, 
					the teacher will continue using it. Sometimes the teacher decides not to implement 
					technology because it could not satisfy the teaching objectives or it does not bring 
					added value to the students. In either case, the teacher shares the project locally and 
					reports findings to online colleagues.

				<p>
					In this scenario, the teacher has decided to try out podcasting in order to provide 
					authentic listening in the target language. Even in a low-access setting, digital media 
					allow for extensive listening and comprehension tasks. (For more on audio activities, 
					see Barrett, 2007.)

				<h5>
					Low-resource, low-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With a computer in the classroom but no projector or Internet access at the school, 
					the teacher’s international colleagues discuss technologies that might not be 
					appropriate to use, but they are always willing to help out with ideas. The teacher 
					has been very interested in integrating podcasts into traditional courses because the 
					authentic listening opportunity would be beneficial to language students and would 
					offer them a wider variety of listening tasks than the recordings accompanying their 
					textbook. The teacher spends time on the Internet at the local library to find suitable 
					podcasts for class. The teacher then downloads a selection on a portable memory 
					device and prepares listening tasks based on it. The teacher uses the class computer 
					and speakers to play the podcast for the students to listen to and complete the tasks 
					as a whole-class activity. After repeating the process several times, students are asked 
					to evaluate the podcasts. They also take listening tests at regular intervals to determine 
					their progress. The teacher’s goal is to help them become independent listeners to 
					authentic materials.
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With a computer lab and Internet, but low bandwidth and unreliable access, the 
					teacher learns about developments in technology through the online community. The 
					teacher always has to assess the relevance of new technologies to the local setting and 
					their practicality, effectiveness, and overall value for the teaching situation at hand. 
					The teacher explores technologies that seem promising and are recommended by 
					colleagues but reevaluates them in relation to the local context and curricular goals.
				</p>

				<p>
					The teacher has evaluated podcasts and decided to implement them with the 
					students. Having to deal with the problem of bandwidth, the teacher decides to create 
					a podquest. This is a “treasure hunt” search of interesting and historic local sites 
					found by listening to audio directions using podcasts that have been downloaded 
					beforehand and saved on the computer hard disk. Enough students own MP3 devices 
					(e.g., iPods or other mobile devices) that there is one for each group, and the teacher 
					transfers the podcasts to these devices. Students read instructions, find the building or 
					site mentioned, and then listen to the audio directions while viewing the building. At 
					some sites, they are told to pick up a brochure, ask the attendant a question, read a 
					timetable, or some other task. They then answer a short quiz on their mobile device. 
					The group must answer all questions correctly (and listen again if they have an 
					incorrect answer) to get directions to the next site. When all groups have finished the 
					activity, the students discuss their experiences, and the teacher evaluates their progress 
					as previously described. (See Reinders, 2007; and Using iPod as a Tour Guide [Apple 
					Computer, 2006], http://developer.apple.com/hardwaredrivers/ipod/iPodNoteReader
					Guide.pdf.)

					a way to help students get the most out of podcasts. The teacher prepares podquests 
					so that students can carry them out while in the computer lab (i.e., with student 
					answers hyperlinked to podcast sites containing further treasure hunt instructions; 
					see Reinders, 2006).

				<h6>
					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					A U.S. university-based IEP is under a university mandate to follow strict guidelines 
					related to student privacy as per the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act 
					(FERPA). A committee consisting of IEP teachers and front office staff has been tasked 
					with creating IEP-specific rules and guidelines to help ensure compliance with FERPA. 
					Teachers have downloaded a copy of the university’s guidelines related to FERPA, 
					prepared by university attorneys. The FERPA committee has divided up different parts 
					of the act related to the following:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						teachers’ use of personally identifiable student information, including
						student record keeping and grade books
					</li>

					<li>
						front office procedures
					</li>

					<li>
						communication with students, sponsors, and family members
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					The FERPA committee uses a questionnaire to assess faculty and staff beliefs about 
					student privacy and knowledge of FERPA. The committee realizes that most teachers 
					are not in compliance and that the front office has compliance issues as well. For 
					example, some teachers are posting grades or graded papers in a publicly accessible 
					space (typically outside their door). Teachers are using email for discussions about 
					students, freely sharing information about students’ family issues and other private 
					information. The front office keeps student records in a locked cabinet, but all the 
					teachers know where the keys are and can access them after hours.
				</p>

				<p>
					The FERPA committee has presented a few workshops for faculty and staff on privacy 
					issues, using materials such as FERPA Resources (n.d.) and the Forum Guide to the 
					Privacy of Student Information (National Forum on Education Statistics, 2006), 
					and all have realized that some changes will need to occur in how information is 
					disseminated. Once those changes are in place, faculty are given an orientation to 
					FERPA, which includes a template they can use in email about students, warning 
					that the confidential information is only for the direct recipient and is not to be 
					forwarded. They are expected to use this template on all their email messages 
					that have information about students. Student orientation for new learners 
					includes a short presentation about student rights and responsibilities related to 
					private information.

				<h5>
					Low-resource, low-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With a low level of access to the Internet (e.g., an email system) and online student 
					record keeping on an internal server or intranet, the major privacy concerns revolve 
					around paper documents. These include not only admissions and visa records, but 
					also teachers’ paper grade books and student papers with grades and comments. 
					Even though much of the work is on paper, many teachers store grades in digital 
					form, in spreadsheets. As the front office moves more records to digital form, they 
					password-protect all computers that hold student information. Teachers have the 
					password so that they can access student records from a computer in the front office. 
					Graded papers are to be handed back to the students directly, not left in an area 
					where anyone has access. Administrators encourage teachers to begin accepting and 
					responding to papers electronically so that graded, printed versions do not need to be 
					distributed to students. These safeguards may take some time to put into place, due to 
					resource constraints.
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					Where the Internet or private intranet is readily available in teacher offices and labs, 
					most student records are moved to electronic form, and teachers have access to them 
					via a password-protected computer in the front office. In order to respond to teachers’ 
					needs for information about students, administrators consider how to set up online 
					access using encryption in order to allow teachers to view student records without 
					violating FERPA. Teachers are strongly urged to accept and respond to homework 
					in electronic form in order to protect student papers with grades on them. The IEP 
					website has been set up so that there are private areas for file sharing in each class as 
					well as a public space for each class.
				</p>

				<h5>
					High-resource, high-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With readily-available Internet access at all times, access to a local intranet, and a 
					sophisticated course management system (CMS), IEP faculty and staff are better 
					positioned to protect students’ privacy (see Blackboard [2010], http://www
					.blackboard.com, or Moodle.org [2010], http://www.moodle.org; for a comparison 
					of CMS systems, see EDU Tools [2010], http://www.edutools.info/). After the FERPA 
					committee makes its recommendations, an online version is posted on the IEP 
					website, and all new faculty are expected to take a short online quiz on FERPA issues 
					before beginning work. All student records are in electronic form in the universitywide
					record-keeping system, with student grades also kept in a password-protected 
					location on the IEP server. Faculty members have different levels of access to the 
					records, depending on their role in the institute: Administrators can see all records; 
					advisors can see grades and some admissions information on the university-wide 
					server and the IEP server; teachers can see grade records on the IEP server. All 
					faculty and staff are strongly encouraged to use only the university email system in 
					discussions about students, not third-party commercial systems, where the email 
					server is not under university control.

					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					An ESL adult school with students from 15 countries has recently been given a new 
					multimedia lab to assist in language teaching and learning. Several classrooms 
					have also been given one or two computers and projectors to use for instructional 
					purposes. One classroom has a digital whiteboard, and some classrooms also have 
					wireless access to share the lab’s Internet capabilities. The teachers have invited a local 
					online CALL instructor to visit their school for three workshops, and this instructor 
					has helped them use several different productivity tools and find good free websites 
					with online lessons to create a fully blended learning environment. The teachers 
					seek to explore these various tools further and have decided to work in teams of 
					three, each team visiting one or more sites per week, trying out tools, and examining 
					software. The teams report their best finds during a monthly teachers’ meeting, which 
					is held in the lab so that new sites and software can be tried out immediately. 
				</p>

				<p>
					The teachers use an evaluation rubric that the CALL instructor helped them develop 
					to analyze and organize information. (For help with rubrics, see Burston, 2003; 
					and Schrock, 2007.) They also use a wiki set up by the instructor to archive their 
					reviews of the tools and sites they have explored, with active links so that others can 
					try them out. Some teacher teams decide to explore ways to use the one-computer 
					classrooms, while others work on effective activities for the large lab. Information 
					about and instructions for software or sites are printed out and kept in a file for 
					additional convenience. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Teachers encourage students with computers at home to use language learning 
					sites with their families so that others too will have a chance to practice in private. 
					They make copies of the instruction sheets for students to take home. In the onecomputer
					classrooms and in the lab, students are often paired so that newcomers to 
					the computer have a more expert partner to help out as they perform the required 
					activities at the keyboard, adjust the headset volume, and so on. This also gives 
					students practice as teaching guides for their families.

				<p>
					At the end of the term, the teachers review the information collected at their wiki in 
					order to evaluate the tools, software, and Internet sites they have used. They discuss 
					the success of various materials with different levels of students and the fit to the 
					curricula of different classes. They organize into new teams for new explorations.

				<h5>
					Low-resource, low-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With a one-computer classroom and a data projector, teachers use presentation 
					slides for explanations of grammar, usage, and vocabulary. They can easily edit their 
					presentations or add material while they teach, for example, by typing in student 
					responses while the class is watching. In their software review research, they find a 
					number of tools that can be installed on the computer and used by teams of students, 
					either for additional practice/discussion exercises or to create their own flash cards or 
					learning games. Student teams take turns using the computer while other groups of 
					students work on different lessons. In very low-level classes, teachers use an electronic 
					whiteboard when possible to help students become familiar with keyboard functions 
					of the computer hardware or to explain how to use a piece of software before students 
					try it on their own.
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					In a one-computer classroom with Internet and projector, teachers have students 
					access publishers’ websites, which provide additional language practice activities and 
					exercises to accompany their textbooks. Students work in small groups, taking turns 
					at the computer, to complete the activities while quietly discussing their answers. 
					Teachers find that these interactive exercises are highly motivating, and they also 
					use them during full lab time. They project the initial lesson for each chapter for 
					the whole class to watch so that students will be prepared to use the lab effectively. 
					Teachers also select software training videos found through searches on TeacherTube 
					([2010] http://www.teachertube.com/) or on a teacher training site such as Russell 
					Stannard’s (2010) TTV (http://www.teachertrainingvideos.com/). Students watch 
					these videos as a class (for example, how to use a word processor) in preparation 
					for activities in the lab. Teachers also select several listening–speaking sites, such 
					as Randall’s ESL Cyber Listening Lab ([Davis, 2010] http://www.esl-lab.com/) or 
					Interesting Things for ESL Students ([Kelly & Kelly, 2010] http://www.manythings
					.org/), so that students can try out the activities in a whole-class setting before 
					accessing them in the lab with headsets or at home.
				</p>

				<h5>
					High-resource, high-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					To use the full multimedia lab, teachers first prepare their students with the activities 
					suggested previously so that they come to the lab ready to sit down and work. 
					Where advance preparation has not been possible, students initially sit away from 
					the computers around a large table in the center of the room and view their activity 
					preparation on the computer projector, on an overhead projector, or on paper with 
					teacher explanation. Students who are already familiar with computer functions may

				<h6>
					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					In a 10th-grade ESL language arts class in a U.S. high school, recently arrived 
					native-Spanish-speaking students are developing English proficiency. The teacher 
					self-describes as someone who likes to encourage students to develop verbal skills 
					conversationally, but wants them to learn how to contribute to academic discussions 
					as well. Aware that open-ended opportunities to participate in large class discussions 
					about literature can be intimidating and challenging, the teacher ensures that 
					the pedagogical approach used allows for multiple low-anxiety opportunities to 
					participate. Literature response groups, author’s chair, and think-pair-share are 
					activities used on a regular basis. With self-awareness of current teaching styles, the 
					instructor decides to use technology to support these academic discussions about 
					literature. In this lesson, the teacher has the students prepare for and participate in 
					literature response groups to ensure that they discuss ideas with one another rather 
					than simply listening to the teacher’s comments (adapted from the ESL Standards for 
					PreK–12 Students [TESOL, 1997], pp. 122–123). They first participate in a fishbowl 
					discussion activity:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Students sit in inner and outer circles. The inner circle discusses a poem, and
						the outer circle takes notes on their peers’ interactions.
					</li>

					<li>
						The teacher facilitates a reflective discussion with the students about which
						observations represented positive ways to participate in group discussions.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					With technology, the language teacher adds several layers to this lesson, including 
					transcripts of discussions by poets and critics in electronic media. (For more on 
					teaching literature with technology, see Hanson-Smith, 2009.)

				<h5>

				</h5>

				<p>
					Without a computer in the classroom, but with a recorder or MP3 player available, 
					the teacher uses the Internet at home or in the school’s lab to find a recording and 
					the transcript from an online written discussion in which native-English-speaking 
					peers have discussed a poem (see, for example, a video clip from the movie <em>Dead</em>

					<em>Poets Society</em> [Haft and Weir, 1989]). After the ESL students have read the poem, they 
					listen to the recording of the discussion while reading copies of the transcript. Then 
					they underline and discuss different ways of exchanging ideas: agreeing, disagreeing, 
					adding comments. Students listen to the teacher read the poem again, then read the 
					transcript and make notes to share in their subsequent fishbowl class discussion. 
					Outside of class, they look up any words that are unfamiliar to them in an online 
					dictionary or a paper dictionary.
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting 
				</h5>

				<p>
					With one computer and a data projector in the classroom, the teacher presents a
					prereading activity with the projector, asking for ideas about a poem based solely on the 
					title. Students discuss their ideas before reading the poem, which is then displayed 
					using the projector. Students listen to various interpretations of the poem on audio 
					recordings that the teacher has located and bookmarked on the Internet (see, for 
					example, Poets.org [Academy of American Poets, 2010], http://www.poets.org/). They 
					also watch and discuss several short clips of literary critics discussing the poem, and 
					with the help of transcripts they create a “phrase guide” of language features that 
					they notice in how the literary critics argue their points. They use these phrase guides 
					in their own fishbowl discussions in class. As in the setting above, they look up any 
					words in the poem or discussion that are unfamiliar to them.
				</p>

				<h5>
					High-resource, high-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With the ESL students in a networked computer lab, with a computer and headset 
					for each student, the language teacher further adapts this lesson. Before discussing 
					the poem orally in class, the ESL students log on to the class blog that the teacher 
					has created. The blog includes the text of the poem (with hyperlinked definitions 
					of difficult vocabulary and links to critical discussions, videos, and their transcripts) 
					and an audio file of the poem that students can read and listen to multiple times at 
					their own pace. With the poem before them on the desktop, students use a discussion 
					forum to share their comments about the poem. (In a large class, the students are 
					divided into groups and respond on different threads.) The online setting allows 
					quieter class members more time to think and respond, and it prevents more orally 
					proficient students from dominating the whole-group discussion. After a period of 
					time online, the language teacher asks students to pair up with a partner from another 
					group (sharing one computer) and scroll back through the online discussions to find 
					and list two comments with which they agree and two comments with which they 
					disagree. The students then use these prepared comments to continue the discussion 
					in an oral, face-to-face format. At the end of class, the teacher saves the discussions 
					into individual files so that they can be used several months later to help students 
					monitor their language progress.

				<p>
					The instructor of an EFL test preparation class seeks to lessen the anxiety the students 
					have with the speaking section of the computerized test. In class the students generate 
					only short utterances due to the pressure of speaking in front of the class. The teacher 
					wants to provide speaking opportunities for students that reduce the pressure they 
					feel about responding “on the spot” while preparing them for the test they will take 
					to enter a North American university. The teacher provides a weekly set of questions, 
					based on the question types found in a major computerized online English ability 
					test like the TOEFL, or Test of English as a Foreign Language (Educational Testing 
					Service, 2010). Early in the term, the teacher explains how the online recording works 
					and supervises the students’ initial trials. For the first few weeks, students may attempt 
					each question as many times as they like. In subsequent weeks, the students are given 
					a fixed amount of time to respond to the audio questions with their own recordings. 
					The students are given the rubric (in print or online) used to evaluate their speaking 
					in the standardized test assessment, and the technology provides an easy method to 
					rerecord until they are satisfied with their corrections.
				</p>

				<p>
					The teacher wants to create a catalog of speaking samples (an audio e-portfolio) 
					of each student that can be used to evaluate improvement in fluency and accuracy. 
					Meeting students individually for recorded interviews is impractical, so the teacher 
					experiments with a variety of technology-based options. During the course of the 
					school term, the teacher also reviews the audio recording archive of each student 
					at regular intervals, referring to the rubric to clarify the comments made on the 
					recording. The teacher suggests online venues for further practice, such as Randall’s 
					ESL Cyber Listening Lab for pronunciation ([Davis, 2010] http://www.esl-lab.com/) 
					or VOA Special English files at ManyThings.org for accuracy and intonation ([Kelly 
					& Kelly, 2010] http://www.manythings.org/voa/scripts/). The teacher explains the 
					relationship between listening and good speaking skills. The teacher helps students 
					find other podcasts on topics of general interest to help with further practice. In 
					class, the teacher discusses the value of rerecording and elicits students’ ideas about 
					their e-portfolio construction process. (For more about creating and using audio and 
					podcasts, see Jobbings, 2005.)

				<p>
					In a classroom with no computer, but where students have access to a full-resource 
					computer lab (with headsets and Internet access) at a scheduled time each week 
					and computers at home, the teacher posts three questions in a podcast constructed 
					specifically for the class (see PodOmatic [2010], http://www.podomatic.com). 
					Students may also use mobile devices to access the podcasts. The questions are based 
					on question types found on a major computerized English ability test like the TOEFL 
					(Test of English as a Foreign Language [Educational Testing Service, 2010]). Students 
					are given a fixed amount of time to submit their audio answers via the podcast. For 
					sample questions, see the TOEFL iBT Speaking Practice Tests ([Renshaw Internet 
					School of English, 2009] http://www.english-itutor.com/TOEFL_iBT_speaking_tests
					.html) or EnglishClub.com ([2010] http://www.englishclub.com/esl-exams/ets-toeflpractice-speaking.htm).
					The teacher records audio comments (either on a mobile 
					phone or on a laptop) about students’ pronunciation, fluency, and accuracy, and 
					emails them to the individual students to protect their privacy. Students rerecord 
					themselves, incorporating corrections.

					In a classroom with no computer, but where students have access to a full-resource

					Audacity ([Audacity Development Team, 2010] http://audacity.sourceforge.com), 
					headsets, and an email system, at regular intervals in the lab class, the teacher gives 
					students the speaking questions and asks them to record responses with the audio 
					software. The teacher then listens to the students’ submissions and, with the sound 
					editing function of the software, splices pronunciation corrections and fluency and 
					accuracy comments directly into student responses and emails the files back to them. 
					Students rerecord as in the previous sections.

				<p>
					In a fully equipped computer lab with Internet access and a course management

					students can access anytime, the teacher posts speaking questions or podcasts to a 
					class discussion forum set up specifically for this purpose. Students use the built-in 
					audio recording software in the CMS to answer. The teacher records responses and the 
					students rerecord as previously described. Students use the CMS to create e-portfolios

					and technicians. The preliminary lesson consists of a review of materials about typical 
					workdays using videos of authentic speakers and accompanying listening exercises at 
					Real English ([Marzio School, 2010] http://www.real-english.com). This preparation 
					allows students to explore the vocabulary and syntax of speaking about the workplace 
					and prepare questions for the informant. They also read short descriptions of the 
					workday at LifeWorks ([Office of Science Education, U.S. National Institute of Health, 
					2004–2010] http://science.education.nih.gov/LifeWorks.nsf/Interviews), which will 
					give them the basis to write their own questions. 
				</p>

				<p>
					The teacher assigns a variety of interviews for students to read and look at so that they 
					will have different points of view to discuss. In small groups, students share what they 
					have found and brainstorm a list of questions. The groups report back to the whole 
					class, and the teacher helps them select the most appropriate questions. Students are 
					assigned or select a specific question to ask, but they must also prepare a follow-up 
					question. The teacher ensures that the work described in the interviews they study will 
					not be the same as that of the informant, so that students will have to ask questions 
					and respond in a more impromptu fashion. Students then meet with the informant. 
					In a class without technology, this could only be a face-to-face meeting with the 
					interviewee, which might be difficult to arrange. If the class has access to technology, 
					however, the informant does not have to be physically present in the classroom and 
					can in fact be anywhere in the world. Materials generated during the interview are 
					recorded (with the informant’s permission, arranged in advance by the teacher) and 
					accessed later for further language practice.
				</p>

				<p>
					Following the question-and-answer session, students are assigned their 
					homework—to write the answers to their specific questions and at least three 
					other interesting points they learned. They access the recording to practice their 
					questions again, and to listen to the speaker’s pronunciation and vocabulary. They

				</h5>

				<p>
					In a classroom with no computer or audiovisual facilities, but with access to a 
					computer lab elsewhere on campus, students view the Real English videos and 
					perform the exercises outside of class. The teacher prints out one interview from 
					LifeWorks for each student, choosing interviews that are not about the same job 
					as the interlocutor’s. Students use the teacher’s mobile phone to speak to the 
					interlocutor. The recording can be made with a simple cassette or digital recorder, 
					with the microphone held to the phone. At a prearranged time, the instructor calls 
					the informant on a mobile phone. Once the informant answers, the instructor puts 
					the phone on its “speakerphone” setting so that the students can interact with the 
					informant through this medium. Students are requested not to simply read their 
					questions, but to interact live with the interviewee. Students may make multiple 
					copies of the interview or listen together in pairs or small groups outside of class.
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting 
				</h5>

				<p>
					With a single computer, data projector, speakers, and Internet access in the classroom, 
					students watch a video that the teacher has found on YouTube (e.g., Nico’s Workday 
					[2007], http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99IYG_xsAYA) or a comparable video at 
					Real English in which an informant describes his or her job. The brainstorming of 
					questions is done in a word processor on the computer and projected to the room. 
					The phone call is made through Skype ([Skype Technologies, 2010] http://www.skype
					.com) or another Internet-based telephony provider and played through the room 
					speakers for clearer sound. Students working in pairs take turns at the class computer 
					writing up their interviews in a class blog or wiki online, and they also access the 
					Internet outside of class to write comments and questions on their peers’ entries.
				</p>

				<h5>
					High-resource, high-access setting 
				</h5>

				<p>
					With Internet access for each student and a school course management system 
					(CMS) like Moodle, students are asked to go to LifeWorks or Real English and select 
					three interviews to review. They then summarize key points they learned and post 
					related questions in the class discussion forum online that their teacher has set up 
					for this purpose. As in the previous scenario, students interact with the informant 
					on Skype ([Skype Technologies, 2010] http://www.skype.com) or, if the interlocutor 
					has Internet access, in their CMS audio chat room. For homework, students post the 
					answers to their questions and three other interesting points they learned on their 
					blogs or, for further speaking practice, in a podcast. (For examples of students writing 
					and talking about their projects, see Zeinsteijer, 2006.)

				<h6>
					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					In a teacher education class focused on ESL teaching methods, student teachers 
					pursuing an initial or supplemental teaching certificate in TESOL have a fieldwork, 
					or hands-on, component in which they combine their research with volunteering in 
					practical teaching situations. These fieldwork experiences take place in various ways 
					throughout the duration of a course, such as offering individual face-to-face tutoring 
					sessions or tutoring online with ESL students. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Each week the teachers read and discuss relevant research that their instructor 
					provides and that they locate through various Internet and library sources. Because 
					their teaching contexts involve high numbers of newcomers (recent immigrants 
					with limited experience with English), the course focuses on sheltered practices for 
					supporting students in understanding the content of secondary subject areas while 
					also learning basic structures of English. A part of their discussion concerns how to 
					use technology in ways that might augment pedagogical strategies that are useful with 
					newcomer students. In the weekly fieldwork component of the class, the in-service 
					teachers utilize various technologies in their one-on-one tutoring of adolescent ESL 
					newcomers. In addition, the teachers share their experiences on a password-protected 
					class-based website (e.g., a wiki or their course management system blog), where they 
					post lesson plan ideas, materials, and multimedia projects. 
				</p>

				<p>
					At the end of their teacher education course, teachers prepare and submit a critical 
					evaluation of which technology tools were most appropriate for their particular 
					tutoring context. Their final lesson plans, recordings, and transcripts are included in 
					their personal electronic portfolios. They also select one or more of their critiques of 
					the research and/or the technology they used to be included in the portfolio. (For 
					a short form for software review, see Schrock, 2007, or ICT4LT CALL Software and 
					Website Evaluation Forms, 2009.)

				<h5>
					Low-resource, low-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With one computer in the classroom and limited Internet access, teachers read and 
					discuss in groups research articles pertaining to adolescent newcomer students and 
					assist one another in modifying their plans for instructional delivery to accommodate 
					students with beginning-level English. The course instructor (or a designated group 
					member) assembles their ideas for modifying instructional delivery for ESL students 
					and publishes these ideas on the course website. The teachers then choose from 
					among these ideas and use them in their individual face-to-face tutoring sessions 
					with an ESL student. (The consultation can also take place online if both student and 
					teacher have Internet access, e.g., with personal or community center computers or 
					through mobile phone technology.)
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting 
				</h5>

				<p>
					With several computers and adequate access to the Internet, including access on their 
					own computers at home, teachers read assigned recent research and then discuss it in 
					small groups to determine how they will work with their ESL students in the weekly 
					tutoring session. After assisting one another with this idea exchange, they post a draft 
					lesson plan to their class wiki or blog. They solicit written comments and discussion 
					on their final lesson plans from the other student teachers. Where students are at 
					some distance from the teachers, instead of face-to-face tutoring, the teachers apply 
					the strategies they are studying in weekly online tutoring sessions using the chat 
					feature within the school’s course management system.
				</p>

				<h5>
					High-resource, high-access setting 
				</h5>

				<p>
					With one computer per teacher, headsets, webcam, and broadband access, teachers 
					each create a video or audio recording, explaining how and why they made lesson 
					plan modifications, and then publish the video or audio file to the course blog or 
					wiki. They conduct their weekly tutoring of an ESL student through a combination 
					of real-time text chat (e.g., at their virtual office at Tapped In [SRI, 2010], http://www
					.tappedin.org), real-time Internet telephony (such as Skype [Skype Technologies, 
					2010], http://www.skype.com) for speaking or pronunciation, or, for a writing class, 
					in Google Docs ([Google, 2010a] http://docs.google.com) or a wiki (e.g., PBworks 
					[2010], http://www.pbworks.com, which has free access for educators). The teachers 
					ask permission of their students to record and use the transcript of their tutoring 
					session for their class work. They select a part of the tutoring session to post to 
					the class blog or wiki, with their comments (either text or audio/video) on the 
					lesson and what was successful or what was not. (For suggestions on using Internet 
					telephony for ESL tutoring, see Online Tutoring World’s TEFL Guide to Teaching with 
					Skype [2006], http://www.onlinetutoringworld.com/technology/teflskype.htm; and

					Shipyard workers take part in a face-to-face class convened in several different training 
					rooms on the shipyard, including a docked ship, immediately following or preceding 
					the workers’ regular shift. This schedule allows them to conveniently access the 
					class and maintain work and personal commitments while focusing on job-related 
					tasks and skills, many of which involve computer use. The work-based curriculum 
					is focused on safety, critical-thinking skills, and problem-solving tasks. Employees 
					must complete certification in a variety of tests, so the teacher uses different kinds 
					of assessments to accustom them to test-taking strategies and to familiarize them 
					with the kinds of tests they will take. However, advanced grammar and writing are 
					included to meet the specific requests of employees. The teacher creates quizzes 
					appropriate to the weekly topics using a free quiz maker, such as Hot Potatoes 
					([Half-Baked Software, 2010] http://hotpot.uvic.ca) or SurveyMonkey ([2010] http://
					www.surveymonkey.com, free online), or on Quia ([2010] http://www.quia.com) if 
					the sponsor is willing to pay. The computer lab is open for these additional activities 
					on Saturdays, which is a day off for most workers. However, workers report that the 
					additional work is one of their favorite activities. Based on employee preferences, 
					the teacher designs further work in grammar, writing, and vocabulary related to job 
					scenarios. (For examples of Quia tasks, see Shipyards VESL [Greenberg, 2010], http://
					www.quia.com/pages/igreenberg/page1.)
				</p>

				<p>
					The teacher prepares short readings based on company safety documents, with 
					comprehension questions that learners discuss in class. The teacher also assigns 
					writing tasks similar to those they will encounter at work. Guest speakers are invited 
					to address the class, and these include a blueprint reading specialist. Students take 
					notes and ask questions of the speakers. The main points are written up later as part 
					of a writing task. Students also work in small groups on problem-solving stories and 
					grammar activities. Additional assignments include workplace ESL tasks using the 
					word processor to write letters requesting OSHA information on tools and materials, 
					notes asking for clarification of procedures, and performance reviews of coworkers on 
					tasks related to safety. Students learn to use a computer word-processing program for 
					writing tasks and a spreadsheet program to keep a record of the quizzes and activities 
					they have completed.

					The teacher is responsible for regularly preparing reports on employee progress to

					while other students engage in communicative activities, such as dialogue practice 
					and discussion of safety readings with comprehension activities. The instructor posts 
					quizzes to a website so that students with computers at home may access them more

					Through the use of a course management system (CMS) such as Moodle ([Moodle
					.org, 2010] http://www.moodle.org), students studying online gain exposure 
					to authentic language materials, including audio and video news materials as 
					well as contact with classmates, computer-based materials, and the language 
					teacher. Interaction through a CMS allows for synchronous and asynchronous 
					communication, and it provides the teacher with digital records of speech and writing 
					that can be used to assess student progress over the course of the term. The course 
					is built around theme- and project-based instructional principles and focuses on 
					U.S. culture. Students devote time each week to reading and listening to web-based 
					materials that inform them about different aspects of U.S. culture. The teacher posts 
					short quizzes online through the CMS to ensure that students are keeping up with 
					the readings and are ready to interact with their peers and discuss these concepts. 
					Students produce individual and collaborative projects and explore English and 
					thematic cultural concepts through the construction of language and content. (For 
					more on using CMS tools, see Harrington, Staffo, & Wright, 2006.)
				</p>

				<p>
					In small groups, students select a subtopic related to U.S. culture and collect artifacts 
					to create a document that highlights features of this cultural characteristic. A starting 
					point for their projects is a series of readings on cross-cultural differences and a 
					discussion of events and conversations with native speakers that seemed odd to 
					them at the time. Artifacts include text, images, videos, and audio. Documents can 
					be constructed as a web page or wiki, word-processing document, movie, slideshow, 
					or presentation, depending on the level of resources available. Individual students 
					are assigned to their groups and have a specific role detailed for them within the 
					group. Each group has its own discussion board within the CMS to share materials 
					in draft form as they collaborate on their project. Eventually, the students share the 
					completed materials with the other groups, allowing for further valuable language 
					exchange during the presentation and structured feedback sessions organized by the 
					teacher. A rubric (such as from Rubistar [ALTEC University of Kansas, 2008], http://
					rubistar.4teachers.org/) helps students do self-evaluations and peer evaluations. The

					digital exchange of information provides the instructor with archived portfolios of 
					student work that assist in record keeping, grading, and assessment. The instructor 
					also uses CMS personal messaging and an online grade book to offer formative and 
					summative feedback to students. After the final presentations of the projects, students 
					evaluate their experiences in collaboration and with the technology.

					With access to the Internet only through an Internet café or home computer,

					Students in different locations and at different times access the CMS to upload

					asynchronously at their convenience. Students log on to the CMS regularly to share 
					their research in group discussion forums, and the teacher helps them schedule

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting

				<p>
					With Internet access readily available in campus labs, students can easily access 
					the CMS to upload their materials and final projects for others to view and assess 
					asynchronously. Students also arrange times to discuss their ongoing projects in 
					synchronous chats through the CMS chat room facility. Peer feedback provided 
					through the class online discussion forum created by the teacher allows students to 
					gain insight into their linguistic strengths and weaknesses as well as the effectiveness 
					of the content and artifacts they have presented. The teacher holds virtual office hours 
					with the CMS text chat tool to share formative feedback.

				<p>
					With higher bandwidth for student Internet access and personal headsets and 
					webcams for each student, learners use desktop videoconferencing (e.g., Dimdim 
					[2010], http://www.dimdim.com/, or Skype.com [Skype Technologies, 2010], http://
					www.skype.com) to present their final projects synchronously, with other students 
					and the instructor watching from their desktop computers. The videoconferencing 
					tool also makes possible online learning for deaf students who need to use sign 
					language for full participation.

					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					A reading teacher in a U.S. IEP wants to use interesting and different supplemental 
					material with students but is concerned about the level of language used in authentic 
					material downloaded from the Internet. Although a document can be scanned 
					manually, comparing it against the teacher’s general knowledge and the Academic 
					Word List (Coxhead, 2007), this is very time consuming and not very accurate. 
					The teacher also wants to monitor the level of vocabulary used by students in their 
					writing, especially in high-intermediate and advanced levels. With readily available 
					digital tools, the teacher can easily compare vocabulary and readability levels in 
					electronic versions of the reading texts and students’ writing. (For more on using 
					concordancers with students, see Lamy & Klarskov Mortensen, 2010.)

					Technology Tasks
				</h6>

				<h5>
					Low-resource, low-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With Internet access at home, the teacher is always looking for interesting
					copyright free material to print out for use with students. The teacher has certain favorite sites 
					used to look for topics, including BreakingNewsEnglish ([Banville, 2010] http://
					www.breakingnewsenglish.com). This site includes activities as well as readings, and 
					the readings are often at a more basic and a more advanced level. The teacher also 
					uses the search tool Twurdy ([2010] http://www.twurdy.com) to show the web pages 
					related to a selected topic, color-coded by readability. Having found what seems like 
					an appropriate reading, the teacher further assesses its readability by copying and 
					pasting it into VocabProfiler ([Cobb, 2010b] http://www.lextutor.ca/vp)or a similar 
					downloadable software program, such as Range (for Windows; [Heatley, 2009] http://
					www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/resources/range.aspx). VocabProfiler shows the percentage 
					of words found in the first 1,000 most common words, the second 1,000 most 
					common words, the Academic Word List (Coxhead, 2007), and off-list words (see 
					Burell, 2008). Range will mark words that belong to different word lists, including the 
					General Service List (Bauman, n.d.) and the Academic Word List (AWL). The teacher 
					can see which words are in each category and decide whether to add an explanation 
					or gloss for the less-common words. The teacher can also copy and paste the reading 
					into Microsoft Word (2010b). Word’s grammar checker will give a Flesch Reading

					Ease score and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. (Openoffice.org also has a readability 
					extension, but for Windows only; it uses a range of readability measures.) Since 
					readability is based on native speaker standards, it is not always accurate for English 
					language learners, but it can give a rough estimate.
				</p>

				<p>
					The teacher can also see the level of language used by the students by pasting their 
					papers into a word processor, using the word count feature to get the number of 
					words and sentences, and employing VocabProfiler or Range to obtain information 
					about their vocabulary use. The VocabProfiler output allows the teacher to quickly 
					see what words, if any, students are using from the Academic Word List. The teacher 
					copies and pastes the results from the word processor and the output table from 
					VocabProfiler into a spreadsheet to easily track student progress.
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting 
				</h5>

				<p>
					In a one-computer classroom with Internet access and a computer projector, and 
					students with relatively easy access to the Internet outside of class, the teacher wants a 
					class of high-intermediate reading/writing students to help select additional readings 
					related to the topics in their textbook. The teacher divides students into 10 groups 
					and assigns each group one of the textbook topics. In class, using the projector, the 
					teacher shows students how to use Twurdy ([2010] http://www.twurdy.com/) to 
					search for the topic and create a subset of possible readings at the appropriate level. 
					The teacher also shows them how to use the word and sentence count tools in the 
					word processor, and how to use VocabProfiler. The teacher gives students a rubric to 
					use, showing the target length of the reading in number of words, the target range 
					in sentences, and the target percentages of words from the first 2,000 most common 
					words and the Academic Word List (AWL). Students are expected to fill in the matrix 
					with this information for each reading. Students outside of class divide up the list of 
					readings, and each selects one or more to work on, first skimming the text to see if it 
					looks interesting, then copying and pasting it into Word to get a word and sentence 
					count. Next, they copy and paste it into VocabProfiler to get information about the 
					vocabulary used. Students share their printouts with their group in class, describing 
					what they have found, and the group picks which article(s) to read. The group can 
					decide that a reading that seems to be too difficult may be interesting enough to 
					include anyway. The teacher puts the selected readings into VocabProfiler, noting 
					words from the AWL to target in class. 
				</p>

				<p>
					After students have read the selected texts and written their papers for each unit, or at 
					a later stage when students have written papers on their assigned readings, the teacher 
					will use VocabProfiler to look at student writing, seeing whether students did use the 
					target vocabulary. The teacher tracks each student’s vocabulary use by copying and 
					pasting the output table from VocabProfiler into a spreadsheet for each student. The 
					teacher also checks the number of words and sentences using the word count feature 
					in the word processor, then adds this information to the spreadsheet as well. At the 
					end of the term, teacher and students have a fairly complete picture of how reading 
					and vocabulary levels have improved.

				<h5>

				</h5>

				<p>
					With easy access to the Internet, a course wiki to share files and resources, and a 
					course management system for grading and private file sharing, the teacher of an 
					advanced reading/writing class does not use a specific textbook for the course. 
					Instead, students read about controversial topics, discuss the topics, then write 
					persuasive essays. The class as a whole decides which topics students will discuss at 
					the beginning of the semester. The teacher assigns students to “for” and “against” 
					teams. After showing students how to use the readability checker in their word 
					processor and VocabProfiler, the teacher sends them to the Multnomah County 
					Library Social Issues portal ([Multnomah County Library, 2010] http://www.multcolib
					.org/homework/sochc.html), Public Agenda ([2010] http://www.publicagenda.com
					/citizen), and an academic portal such as Intute ([2010] http://www.intute.ac.uk/) to 
					search for articles. They fill in a matrix for their target reading, including the source 
					(whether academic or popular interest), orientation to the topic (pro/con/balanced), 
					target length of the reading in number of words, the target range in sentences, and 
					the target percentages of words from the first 2,000 most common words and the 
					Academic Word List (AWL). The teacher checks their matrices to make sure that 
					readings are at an appropriate level of difficulty and to determine whether each 
					reading is appropriately categorized in terms of orientation. The teacher then uses 
					VocabProfiler to find target vocabulary to teach related to each topic—words that 
					students will be expected to use in their writing. Once the readings are approved, 
					students add the readings and their analysis of the readings to the appropriate area on 
					the course wiki, which is set up so that only class members can view the content.
				</p>

				<p>
					After students write their persuasive essays, they use a spreadsheet to record their 
					word count and sentence count and the VocabProfiler output showing the number 
					and percentage of words from the first 1,000 word list, second 1,000 word list, and 
					AWL. They use a private shared area of the course wiki or course management system 
					to send the essay and spreadsheet to the instructor, who in turn uses the same private 
					area to send personal comments. Students add to the same spreadsheet throughout 
					the semester so that they as well as the teacher can see what is happening with 
					their writing. The teacher compiles student grade results each week into a private 
					spreadsheet, where data from the word processor and VocabProfiler can be compared 
					to see if there is a relationship between reading/vocabulary difficulty and student 
					writing results. At the end of the semester, the instructor creates a chart from each 
					student’s individual spreadsheet to graphically display individual student results. The 
					charts are attached to students’ grade reports for the course.

					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					A teacher in an English class for engineers seeks to help adult students develop 
					their grammar and vocabulary for science. Because the students are familiar with 
					technology for a variety of purposes, the teacher has them work on a number of 
					creative projects that will be similar to the presentations and collaborative projects 
					they will take part in as they enter the working world. The teacher uses rubrics to 
					help students ascertain what skills they need to develop further, to ensure they have 
					paid attention to all the steps needed for a successful creative project, to evaluate the 
					technological tools they have used, and to ascertain their level of participation as 
					members of the team. Students also participate in the development of the rubrics they 
					use, which helps them clarify the assignment and the purpose of the tools they use.
				</p>

				<p>
					Once the class has decided on the rubric categories, the teacher downloads the rubrics 
					from the Internet or creates them at one of several sites, e.g., Rubistar ([ALTEC, 2008] 
					http://rubistar.4teachers.org/), Rubrics and Rubric Makers ([Teachnology, 2010] 
					http://www.teach-nology.com/web_tools/rubrics/; for K-12, but can be easily 
					adapted), or PBL Checklists ([ALTEC, 2009] http://pblchecklist.4teachers.org/checklist
					.shtml). (For more about rubrics and a list of other rubric makers, see Goodrich, 
					1996/1997.) The teacher either prints out the rubrics or brings them to class on a 
					portable memory device.

				<p>
					With one or more computers available in the classroom (and optionally a computer 
					projector), and where the students also are able to work in a school computer lab 
					or on a home computer, the teacher assigns a variety of writing tasks (description, 
					narration, analysis) using widely available word-processing software such as Microsoft 
					Word or Openoffice.org ([2010] free download at http://www.openoffice.org). In 
					the course of each assignment, the teacher asks students to use the grammar checker

					Internet is available, the online Compleat Lexical Tutor ([Cobb, 2010b] http://www
					.lextutor.ca) is also free, and students may also search in Google Scholar ([Google, 
					2010f] http://scholar.google.com) for documents with the same phrases or sentences. 
					(For more on using concordances in the classroom, see Lamy & Klarskov Mortensen, 
					2010.) Students use at least two different methods of finding writing problems to 
					offer a comparison. The teacher has students bring their toughest problematic or 
					unsolvable sentences to class to be discussed by everyone using the projector. (Files 
					may be carried to and from computers with portable memory devices, taking care to 
					virus-check before using them in class.) The teacher then helps students create and 
					complete a simple rubric, analyzing which program was of greatest use in resolving 
					grammar and vocabulary questions (see Table 4.1). Students discuss their scoring of 
					the different technologies and which tools they might use in their next assignment.
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting 
				</h5>

				<p>
					With access to the Internet and one computer for every four or five students, EFL 
					science students in an ESP class are assigned a multimedia project to demonstrate 
					aspects of the ecology of their country. Students work in small groups and take turns 
					using the computers to research data, find appropriate images to represent their ideas, 
					and create the slides in a presentation program. (Some students also place their slides 
					on the Internet as a slide show at a photo site like Flickr [Yahoo.com, 2010a], http://
					www.flickr.com, or in a wiki.) The teacher spends class time teaching students to 
					appropriately cite all references for their project. Before beginning data collection, 
					the teacher assists students in developing a rubric that will help them understand 
					their task better and make clear how they are being evaluated for their creative 
					collaboration. Categories might include those in Table 4.2; additional details are 
					filled out by students during class discussion (for a related sample rubric, see Gromik, 
					2006, p. 121; Table 4.2 is based on an English for Science class at Kuwait University, 
					taught by Buthaina Al-Othman, Spring 2004). The teacher reviews the rubric with 
					the students periodically, assisting them in discovering how to strengthen weak areas. 
					Students use the rubrics to score themselves and other teams/projects as part of their 
					final evaluation scheme.

					In a fully networked computer lab with text chat grouping software or an 
					asynchronous discussion forum, or with live online text chat grouping (e.g., 
					in TappedIn [SRI, 2010], http://www.tappedin.org), students are divided into 
					discussion groups to talk about their next writing assignment. Text chat or forum 
					grouping allows them to think about what they will say before writing, and it does 
					not allow the loudest or most orally fluent student to dominate the discussion.

					teacher is available, he or she may take a turn in each of the groupings also. The 
					teacher assigns a student leader of each discussion group whose task is to ensure 
					that students stay focused on the discussion topic and respond to all the question 
					prompts by the end of the allotted time in the lab. At the end of the session, the 
					teacher automatically receives a transcript from each of the chat rooms or forum 
					groups. The teacher uses the transcripts to analyze how students are using the 
					language in this more impromptu setting. The teacher opens the transcripts in the 
					word processor, makes comments on content related to the writing assignment, and 
					suggests corrections where the vocabulary or syntax might be used in the writing 
					assignment itself. Students also automatically receive transcripts from their group, 
					and they save the transcripts in their own folders to use in practicing the corrected 
					terms in their vocabulary blog, where they write a short paragraph using each term 
					correctly. The teacher has students read each other’s blogs at specific intervals. (An 
					RSS [really simple syndication] feed will help remind them when new items have 
					been written.) Students refer to the transcripts and blogs for help with corrections as 
					they are writing their papers with a word processor. At the beginning of the semester, 
					the teacher helps students develop a rubric to help analyze their contributions in the 
					chats, blogging, peer editing workshops, and drafts of their papers. The teacher refers 
					to the rubrics at regular intervals and helps with refinements over the course of the 
					term. The rubrics are of particular importance for the teacher in analyzing individual 
					students’ contributions to group processes such as chats and editing workshops. (See 
					Table 4.3.) Discussion of these rubrics throughout the term helps students determine 
					how best to contribute to group interactions. Students include the rubrics in their 
					e-portfolios.

				<h6>
					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					Teacher educators of primary and secondary ESL teachers in a large university system 
					send their pre-service trainees to internships in schools in a very large geographical 
					area. Although the trainees have local supervisors in the classroom, distance makes 
					it difficult for the interns’ educators to discuss their progress and help with any 
					problems. Some interns must drive several hours to attend a monthly seminar, and 
					bad weather may prevent attendance. The director of the internship program has 
					decided to use an online forum and email for asynchronous help and a chat site for 
					a weekly synchronous, real-time chat in order to provide more immediate help and 
					advice to new teachers. The chat allows time for interns to reflect on practices at their 
					school and an opportunity to ask questions about their work, and it continues the 
					practice of weekly reflective discussions formerly held during their initial training at 
					the school of education. Supervising teachers and administrators in the schools are 
					also invited to the chats to assist in bridging the gaps between pedagogical theory 
					and classroom ESL practices. This e-mentoring is so successful that it is expanded to 
					postgraduate teachers who are experiencing their first years of in-service teaching. 
					Interns and new in-service teachers use dialogue journals or blogging to reflect on 
					their activities, with comments by their university teachers, and an easily updated 
					wiki provides avenues for linking to suggested readings, intern- and teacher-generated 
					lesson plans, and other resources for pedagogy and language teaching. Both interns 
					and in-service teachers are expected to write and respond regularly in the online 
					forum. The teacher educators archive chat transcripts and recordings of discussions 
					with their mentees at the resource website. (Based on an article by Dahlman and 
					Tatinen, 2006; for more on communities of practice, see Hanson-Smith, 2006.)

				<h5>
					Low-resource, low-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With sporadic access to the Internet for interns and in-service teachers at their 
					respective schools, the asynchronous forum, email, blogs, and website may be 
					accessed through an Internet café on a regular basis or at a home computer. Teachers 
					and their supervisors and school administrators set aside regular times for weekly text 
					chat meetings at a free site, such as Tapped In ([SRI, 2010] http://www.tappedin.org). 
					Teachers upload their lesson plans to the archive area of their Tapped In classroom or 
					to a class wiki, where the other participants can comment on them.
				</p>

				<h6>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting
				</h6>

				<p>
					With regular access to the Internet, either at home or through the school labs, interns 
					and teachers participate more easily in forum discussions and send email questions 
					or mobile texts to their supervisors or teacher educators for quick mentor responses. 
					The weekly live text chat may be supplemented by audio if the technology is 
					available, for example, with Yahoo Messenger ([Yahoo.com, 2010b] http://messenger
					.yahoo.com) or Google Phone ([Google, 2010e] http://mail.google.com >Call 
					phone). Interns and in-service teachers contribute resources to the archive wiki and 
					comment on them regularly.
				</p>

				<h6>
					High-resource, high-access setting 
				</h6>

				<p>
					Where headsets and mobile phones are readily available, and the Internet connection 
					is high speed and high capacity (broadband), live audio/video chats with a free 
					Internet phone service (for example, Skype [Skype Technologies, 2010], http://www
					.skype.com/) or with audio/video applications such as Elluminate ([2010] http://
					www.elluminate.com/) or WiZiQ ([AuthorGEN, 2010] http://www.wiziq.com) allow 
					frequent connections to mentors and supervisors and provide an appropriate setting 
					for weekly reflective meetings. Participants videotape segments of their lessons with 
					digital camera or mobile phone to discuss during their meetings. During the course of 
					the weekly meeting, a web tour in the chat application allows the mentor teacher to 
					skim through many of the pre- and in-service teachers’ blogs and wiki contributions 
					to review and discuss their progress and concerns. With web conferencing, pre-service 
					teachers may elect to take the course entirely online.

				<p>
					To stay abreast of current developments in technology, in addition to subscriptions to 
					technology journals, CALL teachers and teacher trainers join and regularly access an 
					e-list or forum with a community of practitioners who discuss new technologies and 
					pedagogical issues. Often this is the only way for expert educators to maintain contact 
					with others who use and explore innovative technologies. They also follow one or 
					more technology blogs and write regularly in their own technology-oriented blog or 
					wiki, describing new experiments and discoveries and their relationship to classroom 
					activities. Such writings provide self-knowledge and are also shared with the e-list 
					community. To continually develop their skills, CALL educators regularly attend 
					technology conferences and participate in free online presentations and workshops, 
					such as TESOL’s CALL Interest Section Electronic Village Online ([TESOL, 2010a] 
					http://evosessions.pbworks.com/). 
				</p>

				<p>
					CALL teachers and teacher trainers develop their own website or wiki with links to 
					appropriate instructional videos online, social networking sites, and other resources 
					their teacher-students will use repeatedly, and they create instructional videos or 
					screencasts as needed. (For more on CALL teacher preparation, see Kessler, 2006.)

				<h6>
					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					In a U.S. middle school, a sixth-grade group of Spanish-speaking students is taking an 
					ESL language arts class. As part of a formative evaluation plan, their language teacher 
					would like to ensure that each of the students is involved in ongoing self-assessment. 
					Typically, the teacher creates a system in which students collect their work in folders 
					(learner logs, drafts of essays with teacher and peer comments, vocabulary notebooks, 
					double-entry journals, and self-reviews of essays) so that they can create end of semester
					portfolios to track their language growth. The teacher has subsequently 
					found that the ESL students are often overwhelmed by the amount of paper that 
					accumulates over time and therefore do not make the best use of their previous work. 
					Because the school has recently acquired a CMS system (e.g., Moodle [Moodle.org, 
					2010], http://www.moodle.org) and placed it on their server, the teacher wants to use 
					the technology to improve efficiency in grading and maintaining records for purposes 
					of formative assessment. The instructor uses a variety of readily available CMS tools 
					to help students understand their own progress during the year. When posting 
					student grades or their work in the class CMS space, the teacher uses coded numbers 
					to preserve students’ privacy. (For more on assessment, see Effective Assessment in a 
					Digital Ageby the Higher Education Funding Council for England, 2010.)

				<p>
					With a single computer outside of class, but no in-class computers, the teacher learns 
					how to use the school’s CMS to maintain a grade book. The teacher posts students’ 
					coded grades on a weekly basis. Using a checklist to make weekly comments on each 
					student’s areas of language improvement and areas in need of improvement, the 
					teacher keeps the comments organized into private areas or folders, accessible only 
					to the individual student. The teacher also makes a compilation of these comments 
					available to students at the end of the semester during one-on-one conferencing 
					about their language progress. When student and teacher sit down together at the 
					computer, the written comments provide a visual format that helps low-intermediate

				<p>
					ESL students follow the conversation. This process helps them self-assess their growth 
					over time, and together the student and teacher set realistic language learning goals 
					for the next semester.
				</p>

				<h6>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting 
				</h6>

				<p>
					With a networked computer lab available by reservation for one hour once a week, 
					but also available after school, the teacher helps students see their growth in writing 
					fluency by having them write for 30 minutes every other week using a variety of 
					prompts (e.g., pictures, story starters, engaging questions). The students then use the 
					word count tool built into the word-processing software to document the number 
					of words they have written. Each student keeps a spreadsheet that tracks the number 
					of words he or she writes across the semester. The spreadsheet allows for a visually 
					appealing chart that shows a progress line of growth in the total number of words 
					students can write in a 30-minute period.
				</p>

				<p>
					To help students revise their essays, the teacher uses reviewing tools such as sidebar 
					comments and change tracking with colors on students’ essays (both functions built 
					into the word processor). In the computer lab, students revise their essays based on 
					the comments. The teacher maintains a class website or wiki within the CMS that 
					allows centralization of the collection of the students’ coded fluency spreadsheets and 
					their reviewed essays.
				</p>

				<h6>
					High-resource, high-access setting 
				</h6>

				<p>
					With a networked computer for each student available several times a week during 
					class, as well as after school, the teacher maintains a class blog or discussion forum 
					within the CMS so that students can locate course materials online for reference and 
					collect all the course documents in one place. The students create electronic portfolios 
					that document their language progress across the semester, in which they include 
					the spreadsheets documenting word count in their free writing task. The portfolios 
					ensure that students are using English in multiple genres (narrative and persuasive 
					essays, book summaries, analyses, etc.) and in multiple modes (hyperlinked writing, 
					multimedia projects, and audio files).
