			<h2>
				The Relationship of the TESOL Technology Standars to Other Standards
			</h2>

			<p class="chapterSummary">
				This chapter compares the TESOL Technology Standards with technology 
				standards developed by the International Society for Technology in 
				Education (ISTE) and the United Nations Education, Scientific and 
				Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
			</p>

			<p>
				Organizations such as the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) 
				and the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 
				have developed their own technology standards for educational settings: ISTE’s 
				National Educational Technology Standards (NETS) and UNESCO’s Information 
				and Communication Technologies Competency Standards for Teachers (ICT-CST). 
				It is important to see the TESOL standards as not being in competition with these 
				but rather complementing them. In fact, the previous versions of the ISTE NETS for 
				students (ISTE, 1998) and for teachers (ISTE, 2000) strongly influenced the design 
				of the TESOL Technology Standards. The ISTE NETS were revised while the TESOL 
				standards were being developed, and the newer versions of ISTE NETS were released 
				in 2007 for students and 2008 for teachers.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are three major differences between the TESOL Technology Standards and the 
				ISTE and UNESCO standards. First, the TESOL Technology Standards are specific 
				to language learning while the ISTE and UNESCO standards are designed to cover 
				all educational fields. Second, the TESOL standards apply to a considerable range 
				of potential users: children and adults, ESL and EFL learners, all proficiency levels, 
				situations with both high and low levels of technology resources, and a variety of 
				educational settings. The ISTE and UNESCO standards seem most compatible with 
				a more centralized institutional structure and assume development over a period 
				of years. The ISTE student standards presuppose a relatively intact, age-appropriate 
				level of communicative competence in the target language. They are not targeted at 
				adults, nor at those whose objectives differ from those of general education. They are 
				embedded in a developmental framework covering 13 years of an individual’s life 
				(kindergarten through 12th grade) and do not readily accommodate the distinction 
				between those with high and low degrees of literacy (both traditional and digital) in

				their native cultures. Finally, the TESOL standards are more neutral to educational 
				approach than most other standards. For example, they do not mandate the use 
				of technology for the development of critical-thinking skills or creativity as both 
				the ISTE and the UNESCO standards do, recognizing that those are objectives of 
				specific curricula rather than the whole field of TESOL. The TESOL standards can 
				accommodate the fact that English is taught and learned sometimes for purely 
				instrumental purposes and sometimes for quite specific purposes. The effective use of 
				technology can support these endeavors.

				Concordance With the ISTE NETS
			</h3>

			<p>
				Like the TESOL standards, the ISTE NETS include separate listings for students and 
				teachers, although ISTE additionally has a set of standards specifically targeted to 
				administrators. Tables 5.1 and 5.2 provide a rough concordance between the TESOL 
				Technology Standards and ISTE NETS drawn from the six ISTE NETS for students 
				and teachers (indicated by numbers) and their associated performance indicators 
				(indicated by letters). See http://www.iste.org/standards.aspx for the full set of the 
				ISTE NETS (ISTE, 2000, 2007). Note that not all of the TESOL standards have obvious 
				corollaries for the ISTE ones, and not all the ISTE standards link to ones for TESOL. 
				Those listed here represent overlaps rather than exact equivalencies.

			<h3>
				Concordance With UNESCO Standards
			</h3>

			<p>
				In a set of three core documents (UNESCO 2008a, 2008b, 2008c), UNESCO 
				has laid out a framework for Information and Communication Technologies 
				Competency Standards for Teachers (ICT-CST). According to the foreword, “Schools 
				and classrooms, both real and virtual, must have teachers who are equipped with 
				technology resources and skills and who can effectively teach the necessary subject 
				matter content while incorporating technology concepts and skills” (UNESCO, 
				2008c, p. 1). However, unlike the TESOL Technology Standards for Language 
				Teachers, the ICT-CSTs focus heavily on teachers’ use of technology to “play an 
				essential role in producing technology capable students” (UNESCO, 2008c, p. 1), 
				despite the fact that the documents do not provide explicit standards for the students 
				themselves analogous to either the TESOL Technology Standards for Language 
				Learners or ISTE NETS for students.
			</p>

			<p>
				A further distinction between the UNESCO ICT-CST and the TESOL and ISTE 
				standards is in their basic structure. The UNESCO ICT-CST standards are divided 
				among three overlapping approaches that are seen as a developmental continuum. 
				The first approach, technology literacy, sets the foundation for ICT competency. The 
				second approach, knowledge deepening, involves the application of knowledge 
				in complex problem solving and tasks, as well as an educational movement from 
				traditional classrooms to collaborative learning. The third approach, knowledge 
				creation, involves development of 21st-century skills, self-management, and learning 
				organizations. Each of these approaches includes six dimensions: policy and vision, 
				curriculum and assessment, pedagogy, ICT, organization and administration, and 
				teacher professional development. However, these dimensions reach well beyond 
				the classroom. For example, the policy and vision statement for the technology 
				literacy approach begins as follows: “The policy goal of this approach is to prepare 
				learners, citizens, and a workforce that is capable of taking up new technologies so 
				as to support social development and improve economic productivity” (UNESCO, 
				2008a, p. 10).

			<p>
				Of the three UNESCO documents (2008a, 2008b, 2008c), the one that most 
				closely connects to the TESOL Technology Standards for Language Teachers is the 
				Implementation Guidelines (UNESCO 2008b), and it is with those guidelines 
				that we attempt a rough concordance. The objective is to clarify where the TESOL 
				and UNESCO standards appear to overlap and where they appear to differ so that 
				teachers, teacher educators, administrators, and policy makers attempting to reconcile 
				the two will have a clearer idea of their interrelationship.
			</p>

			<p>
				As suggested above, the concordance of the TESOL Technology Standards for 
				Language Teachers with UNESCO ICT-CST is less clear than with ISTE NETS for 
				teachers. The shaded parts of Table 5.3 show the areas of greatest overlap: all 
				six components of the technology literacy approach, and ICT and professional 
				development components of the other two approaches. Those cells are numbered 
				in parentheses according to the system used within UNESCO (2008c). Note that 
				technology competence also plays a role in several of the nonshaded cells, but to a 
				lesser extent, and in many cases the directives provided in those categories relate to 
				the teacher’s role in developing a technologically proficient citizenry.
			</p>

			<p>
				The concordance is listed in Table 5.4. The numbers in the UNESCO column 
				correspond to the categories in Table 5.3 and are the same ones used in UNESCO’s 
				<em>ICT Competency Standards for Teachers: Implementation Guidelines</em> (2008c).

			<h3>
				Conclusion
			</h3>

			<p>
				This chapter has focused on the ISTE NETS and UNESCO ICT-CST because they are 
				widely recognized internationally. In fact, the previous version of the ISTE NETS 
				provided an important base for considerations that were incorporated into the 
				TESOL Technology Standards. There are and will continue to be other organizational 
				entities—governmental, institutional, and professional—providing standards or other 
				formal guidelines delineating the expectations of teachers and students with regard to 
				technology competence for language learning purposes.
			</p>

			<p>
				Regardless of what other requirements come into play, the TESOL Technology 
				Standards arguably provide the clearest and most consistent link to date between 
				technology and the specific considerations relevant to the tasks and processes 
				of second language learning. Given that teachers and students may be subject to 
				standards from multiple sources, it is critical at an institutional level to be aware of 
				potential conflicts or contradictions among them so that the expectations are clear. 
				It is hoped that the concordances provided here will provide a model for individuals 
				and administrators with a need to reconcile any other standards with the TESOL 
				Technology Standards so that students and teachers may be provided with a coherent 
				and reasonable set of targets to demonstrate their competency.
