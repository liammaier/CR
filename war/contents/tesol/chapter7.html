			<h2>
				Administrators and the Technology Standards
			</h2>

			<p class="chapterSummary">
				This chapter explains how the standards affect administrators of English 
				language programs and programs that include English language 
				learners and teachers. The vignettes give examples of administrators 
				taking action to meet all seven of the goals in the learner and 
				teacher standards.
			</p>

			<p>
				The TESOL Technology Standards offer guidance for administrators in many aspects 
				of decision-making about technology use in their programs. The TESOL standards 
				have a unique focus on language teaching and learning. This differs from other 
				technology-focused standards, e.g., the ISTE National Educational Technology 
				Standards and the UNESCO Information and Communication Technologies 
				Competency Standards for Teachers (see Chapter 5 for a detailed comparison). 
				The standards for language learners provide a baseline for expectations about 
				what students should be able to do with technology while they are learning 
				language in the program. These expectations for learners have strong implications 
				for decision-making about classroom facilities, designing and implementing 
				curriculum, and teaching practice. The standards for language teachers set a baseline 
				for expectations that can be used in hiring and that should be used in professional 
				development. The standards provide elements for administrators to consider when 
				they are designing and assessing facilities and curriculum and evaluating teaching 
				practices. The standards for language teachers also allow administrators to recognize 
				teachers with higher levels of technological ability (“expert” level) and compensate 
				them accordingly.
			</p>

			<p>
				Suggestions from the technology standards are echoed in Witbeck and Healey’s 
				(n.d.) “Technology and the Language Program Administrator.” For effective decision 
				making about instructional use of technology, Witbeck and Healey suggest that 
				administrators must
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Have a basic understanding of technological language-learning tools
					and the ways in which each tool can support (or subvert!) different 
					pedagogical models.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Listen and respond to what teachers say about their classroom needs and
					which tools are needed. 
				</li>

				<li>
					Provide funding for ongoing technical support.
				</li>

				<li>
					Ensure that adequate budget and staff effort are devoted to maintaining and
					regularly upgrading facilities. (p. 253)
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Effective use of technology in instruction requires ongoing professional development 
				for teachers, as well, according to Witbeck and Healey. They point out that
			</p>

			<p class="longQuote">
				institutions need to protect their instructional technology investments 
				by funding initial and ongoing training so that teachers can make 
				effective use of the technology available to them. A teacher skilled 
				in the use of instructional technology can take advantage of free or 
				inexpensive resources and use them well. An unskilled teacher will 
				need help even to reach a basic level of competence, and students will 
				likely be far from satisfied. (p. 265)
			</p>

			<p>
				Administrators who meet the basic standards for teachers (Goal 1 in technology 
				standards for language teachers, in particular) will be better able to make appropriate 
				decisions about funding for technology and about overall technology use in their 
				institutions. Teachers should participate actively in decision-making about technology 
				purchases and curricular use (Goal 2 Standard 1 in the standards for language 
				teachers). When teachers help decide what technology to buy, they are more likely to 
				use it. This is especially important with expensive or complex technology tools. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Technical support is an essential component of technology use. It is reflected directly 
				in Goal 1 Standard 4 of the technology standards for language learners, Goal 2 
				Standard 2 of the standards for language teachers, and indirectly anywhere that 
				technology use is mentioned. Changes are occurring rapidly in hardware, software, 
				and other digital tools and material. Threats from viruses and other malware are 
				ongoing risks. The changes and threats mean that a technology-enhanced activity 
				that worked in class or the lab yesterday may not work today. Teachers do need to 
				have basic troubleshooting skills in order to handle routine problems, typically ones 
				that are resolved by restarting a computer. However, good technical support can be 
				proactive in warding off technology failures before they occur and in dealing with 
				them on the spot, in class or in the lab. Teachers and students who cannot trust 
				technology, at least at some level, are unlikely to use it.
			</p>

			<p>
				The learner standards and the teacher standards have curricular implications for 
				administrators as well. Students require not only basic computer skills but also an 
				ability to use technology-based productivity, skill-building, and communication and 
				collaboration tools. These skills, especially with communication and collaboration, 
				should be integrated into the curriculum. Training for students in how to be more 
				independent in learning with technology should also be part of the curriculum. This 
				implies that learners are not simply left on their own to puzzle out what to use and 
				how to use it in a computer lab. Another consequence is that learners should have

			<p>
				some choices about what to learn and instruction in making good choices. Also 
				essential for students is an awareness of Internet safety precautions.
			</p>

			<p>
				Where possible, administrators should provide technology tools for teachers to use in 
				preparing for class, grading, record keeping, and learner assessment. At a minimum, 
				this will include access to the Internet and to productivity software, such as a word 
				processor and grade book. Wherever feasible, administrators should provide secure 
				digital storage space for teachers and for student work and a mechanism for teachers 
				and students to communicate and share information and material with each other. 
				Teachers will also need legal access to the material they use, which means that 
				administrators should put guidelines and procedures in place to discourage piracy 
				and protect student privacy. Teachers will need access to information and research, 
				and administrators should encourage teachers to conduct their own research, as well.
			</p>

			<p>
				The standards repeatedly emphasize the importance of professional development 
				for teachers. Professional development is at the heart of Goal 1 of the teacher 
				standards, especially Standard 3, and is implied in many of the other goals and 
				standards. Technology changes rapidly, so even someone who is hired with technical 
				skills can quickly become out of date without ongoing professional development. 
				Especially in settings with little money for professional development, it can be 
				cost-effective to use a training of trainers model: encouraging and appropriately 
				compensating one or more of the teachers to provide in-house training for his or her 
				colleagues. It is also very important for administrators to reward teachers who do 
				use technology appropriately, meeting all the basic or expert-level standards. With a 
				system of recognition and rewards in place, teachers will see that administrators take 
				technology use in teaching seriously. When administrators are fully supportive of 
				technology use, teachers are more likely to respond accordingly.
			</p>

			<p>
				The standards deliberately do not make recommendations for use of specific 
				hardware and software. The mandate is for appropriate use of “available” technology. 
				As a result, the standards can be applied equally in high-resource settings and in 
				low-resource settings, though exactly what is “available” will be different.
				In highresource settings, technology should be more extensively used in teaching and 
				learning. Administrators in every setting should work with teachers, learners, and 
				other stakeholders to meet the highest expectations of appropriate use of technology. 
				The emphasis is on quality, not quantity.
			</p>

			<p>
				The standards do assume that almost all teachers and most learners will have access 
				to computers and the Internet to some degree. Access may be at home, in an Internet 
				café, or at work. Even if students cannot use technology directly due to restricted 
				access to computers and the Internet, teachers can generally find a way to access 
				and download useful information and material to bring into the classroom. Free 
				and low-cost resources are available for online file storage and sharing. (Google 
				Docs [Google, 2010a] is an example.) Free email accounts and free websites or wikis 
				are also available. Increasingly, educational content can be delivered and language 
				learners can interact with teachers and other learners on mobile phones and other

				that more technology tools will be available over time in all settings, which provides

				The following vignette helps to exemplify how administrators can implement the 
				TESOL Technology Standards in low-resource, low-access environments; mediumresource,
				medium-access environments; and high-resource, high-access environments.

					Adding Technology Resources

			<section class="subsection" data-number="2" data-name="Background">

				<h6>
					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					The administrator’s institution is discussing adding technology resources to enhance 
					teaching and learning. Having additional technology resources in the school 
					would also address the demands of parents, sponsors, and students who feel that 
					technology must be part of the learning process. The administrator examines the 
					TESOL Technology Standards for guidance as to how to proceed. Teacher Goal 1,
					<em>Language teachers acquire and maintain foundational knowledge and skills in technology for 
					professional purposes</em>, emphasizes the need to ensure that teachers have the necessary 
					skills in order to implement whatever technology resources are added. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Before embarking on a technology-related change, the administrator asks teachers to 
					fill out a CALL questionnaire regarding:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						their current skill level with technology,
					</li>

					<li>
						their access to computers and the Internet at home,
					</li>

					<li>
						how much they have used technology in teaching, and
					</li>

					<li>
						their areas of interest in learning more about using technology in teaching.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					The responses allow the administrator to determine who among those already 
					on staff might be at expert level as described in the technology standards. The 
					administrator also seeks faculty advice about who on staff might be a good lead 
					technology teacher to provide teacher training workshops, demonstrate appropriate 
					pedagogical resources for language learning, advise on design of a lab, and so forth. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Interested teachers form part of a CALL committee, reviewing and sharing 
					information about the one-computer classroom (e.g., Burkhart, 1999; Gaer, n.d.), 
					computer labs and self-access centers (e.g., Healey, 2009; Self-access, 2002), and 
					use of mobile technologies (e.g., Chinnery, 2006). All teachers are encouraged to 
					participate in learning communities related to technology in language teaching, 
					such as Webheads in Action ([2010] http://webheadsinaction.org/), IATEFL Learning 
					Technologies Special Interest Group ([2010] http://groups.yahoo.com/group
					/LearningTechnologiesSIG/), LearnCentral ([Elluminate, 2010] webcasts, http://
					www.learncentral.org/), MERLOT (Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning 
					and Online Teaching [California State University, 2010], http://www.merlot.org
					/merlot/index.htm), and the TESOL CALL Interest Section ([2010b] http://www
					.call-is.org/info/).

				<h6>
					Technology Tasks
				</h6>

				<h5>
					Low-resource, low-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					This environment has very few resources: one computer and a data projector for 
					checkout, but little else available. The administrator encourages teachers to learn how 
					to use free and low-cost resources to enhance the one-computer classroom (meeting 
					Goal 2, <em>Language teachers integrate pedagogical knowledge and skills with technology to 
					enhance language teaching and learning</em>). One of the teachers already has more skills 
					with technology, so she is designated the leader of this effort and is given a stipend 
					for technology work (see Teacher Goal 1 Standard 1 Vignette: New Technology 
					Course for Teachers). The administrator provides the lead technology teacher with 
					funding for professional development. This pays for an online course to start, then 
					attending a conference. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Other teachers receive a small stipend for attending a series of short evening and 
					weekend workshops presented by the lead teacher to colleagues. The workshops give 
					basic information about how to use a one-computer classroom and about online 
					resources that would be appropriate with the school curriculum, including material
					that the teachers can print out to bring to their classes and material to use in
					a onecomputer classroom. The administrator includes attendance at these workshops as 
					part of the teachers’ yearly professional development plans. Teachers are expected 
					to use this information in their classes. The administrator asks for reports from each 
					teacher describing what they have done with the materials as part of the teachers’ 
					annual evaluations. 
				</p>

				<p>
					The administrator equips the teachers’ room with several computers with Internet 
					connections so that teachers have a safe place to practice what they are learning. The 
					computers are also equipped with easy-to-use grade book software or with access to 
					an online grade book program (e.g., SnapGrades [2010], http://snapgrades.com) to 
					help meet Goal 3, <em>Language teachers apply technology in record keeping, feedback, and 
					assessment</em>. Connecting with a wider community of practice through the Internet 
					helps teachers meet Goal 4, <em>Language teachers use technology to improve communication, 
					collaboration, and efficiency</em>. At the same time as professional development is ongoing 
					for teachers, the administrator seeks out grants that would pay for projectors and 
					Internet connections in every classroom.
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					This environment has modest resources available: a small computer lab with 
					Internet access, two computers and projectors to check out, and Internet access in 
					several classrooms. The administrator looks at the results of the CALL questionnaire 
					to determine where the areas of expertise are among the teachers. One teacher is 
					designated as the lead technology teacher and given a stipend for technology work. 
					Using the results of the CALL questionnaire, the lead teacher organizes study groups 
					among the teachers to build pedagogical and technical expertise in their areas of 
					interest. He provides resources and guides the initial meetings of the groups. He 
					encourages teachers to try what they are learning after each session to meet Goal 2, 
					<em>Language teachers integrate pedagogical knowledge and skills with technology to enhance 
					language teaching and learning</em>.

				</div>

<!-- Page 159 -->

				<p>
					In order to meet Goal 3, <em>Language teachers apply technology in record keeping, feedback, 
					and assessment</em>, the administrator has a course management system (CMS), such 
					as the free Moodle ([Moodle.org, 2010] http://moodle.org) or Sakai ([Sakai 
					Foundation, 2010] http://sakaiproject.org), or the commercial Blackboard ([2010] 
					http://blackboard.com) set up on the school’s server. The CMS allows teachers to 
					record their grades and provide students with online access to their grades. Teachers 
					are expected to use the CMS. The administrator makes sure that there are enough 
					computers available in the teacher resource room so that teachers who do not have 
					access at home can use the equipment at school. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Email is used for school communication, part of meeting Goal 4, <em>Language teachers 
					use technology to improve communication, collaboration, and efficiency</em>. In order to meet 
					this collaborative goal, the administrator makes sure that teachers can share their 
					resources with each other on the school server. For student privacy and security, 
					teachers are reminded to use password protection and other security messages in 
					handling confidential information electronically. (See Teacher Goal 1 Standard 4 
					Vignette: Compliance with Privacy Regulations.) 
				</p>

				<p>
					The administrator provides funding for the lead technology teacher to attend an 
					international conference. The lead technology teacher and several others who have 
					been active in using technology in their classes receive funding to attend a regional 
					conference. Teachers are expected to use the information from the conference and 
					other training in their classes. The administrator asks for reports from each teacher 
					about how they have used technology in their teaching as part of the teachers’ 
					annual evaluations.
				</p>

				<h5>
					High-resource, high-access setting 
				</h5>

				<p>
					The school has access to a web server and file server (intranet). The school also has a 
					networked set of 25 netbooks and a computer with a projector or with an interactive 
					whiteboard in most classrooms. (See Davies, Walker, Rendall, & Hewer, 2010; and 
					Dallas ISD, n.d., for more on interactive whiteboards.) The administrator is interested 
					in expanding the technology infrastructure at the school and increasing the use of 
					technology for language teaching. In order to ensure effective implementation, the 
					administrator reviews the results of the CALL questionnaire. She uses the results 
					to create a CALL committee, a group of teachers interested in technology who will 
					work closely with the school’s technical support staff. The administrator requests the 
					committee to gather information about possible improvements to the technology 
					infrastructure and equipment. The committee is expected to discuss the options with 
					all the teachers and build consensus. 
				</p>

				<p>
					As a result of the committee’s work, the administrator decides to upgrade the school 
					server, add wireless Internet connectivity throughout the school, purchase a class 
					set of networked laptops (netbooks), and add a data projector or an interactive 
					whiteboard in most classrooms. Teachers reserve the use of the class set of netbooks 
					online. Teachers with an interest in working with the interactive whiteboards are 
					scheduled to use those rooms. The school server offers web space for each class, so 
					teachers can set up class web pages that are kept secure. All the teachers take part

				<p>
					in ongoing workshops about how to use the class set of laptops, the interactive 
					whiteboards, class web pages, and a one-computer classroom to achieve their course 
					goals (meeting Goal 2, <em>Language teachers integrate pedagogical knowledge and skills with 
					technology to enhance language teaching and learning</em>).
				</p>

				<p>
					The administrator addresses Goal 3, <em>Language teachers apply technology in record 
					keeping, feedback, and assessment</em>, by setting up a course management system (CMS) 
					on the school server. The CMS allows teachers to record their grades and provide 
					students with online access to their grades. All teachers have email accounts and use 
					email for communicating with their students, parents, administrators, and each other. 
					The teachers also share resources with each other on the school server. The use of the 
					CMS, email, and shared resources helps meet Goal 4, <em>Language teachers use technology 
					to improve communication, collaboration, and efficiency</em>. 
				</p>

				<p>
					The administrator encourages teachers to submit proposals to conferences about their 
					use of technology and provides funding for teachers who have a proposal accepted. 
					At least one member of the CALL committee and one technical support staff person 
					are funded to attend a major international conference together. The administrator 
					will use the new ideas that both the teacher and the tech support person see as useful. 
					Improved use of technology is a part of the school’s five-year plan. The administrator 
					uses reports from each teacher about what they have done with technology as part of 
					the teachers’ annual evaluations.

					Conclusion
				</h6>

				<p>
					This chapter has addressed considerations for administrators in applying the 
					technology standards in their programs. A key objective in the technology standards 
					for language learners is to have access to technology for students. At a minimum, 
					access should be at the level of technology that is readily available. Successful 
					use of technology requires technical support for students when they need it. 
					Technical support also ensures that classroom equipment is in good working order. 
					Administrators should address the curricular implications for learners, as well: that 
					courses employ available technology as appropriate, and that students become more 
					skilled users of the technology that is available.
				</p>

				<p>
					To meet the TESOL Technology Standards for Language Teachers, administrators 
					need to hire teachers with the requisite level of technological competence or provide 
					training to bring teachers to that level of skill. Although having technical support 
					available for teachers is necessary, it is not enough to ensure that technology will be 
					used effectively. Ongoing professional development is essential. In order to perform 
					at the highest levels, teachers will also need access to resources: productivity tools, 
					classroom material, and information and research about best practices. Teachers 
					need access to the Internet and a mechanism to collaborate with their colleagues and 
					share information with students, parents, administrators, and other stakeholders. 
					Setting up mechanisms and resources that enable teachers to share information 
					about technology use with each other is helpful and relatively low-cost. Teachers who

				<p>
					are at an “expert” skill level and who use their skills to help their students and their 
					colleagues should be compensated appropriately.
				</p>

				<p>
					The standards recommend that administrators enable teachers to be part
					of decisionmaking about technology purchases and use. Administrators should also encourage 
					teachers to design and manage how they use technology in their teaching. Including 
					assessment of student use of technology in classroom assessment processes helps 
					ensure accountability. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Administrators will find the Program Assessment Rubric in Chapter 9 of this volume 
					useful in setting targets and assessing whether these targets have been met.
