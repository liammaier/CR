				Introduction
			</h2>

			<p>
				This book extends and clarifies the <em>TESOL Technology Standards Framework Document</em>
				(2008). The framework document presented the Technology Standards for Language 
				Learners and the Technology Standards for Language Teachers with the same goals, 
				standards, and performance indicators as in the current document. This book, 
				however, puts the standards into context by providing at least one vignette for each 
				standard, elaborating on relevant research that informed the standards, and adding 
				chapters targeted to teacher educators, administrators, and online teachers. Readers 
				can assess their compliance with the standards by using the checklists for self-assessment
				and program assessment in Chapter 9.
			</p>

			<p>
				This book helps students, teachers, teacher educators, administrators, and researchers 
				better understand the technology standards and how they can be applied in the 
				varied contexts in which language instruction occurs. Throughout this book, there has 
				been a deliberate attempt to ensure that the standards and related information are 
				applicable in a wide range of contexts: foreign language, second language, child, teen, 
				adult, higher education, vocational education, language for specific purposes, and 
				fully online programs; and in settings with low, medium, or high resources and access 
				to communication technologies. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Throughout this book we use the phrase <em>available technology</em> rather than specifying 
				particular resources. This is done deliberately so that those with little access to 
				technology resources can apply the standards in their contexts, while those with a 
				great deal of access to technology are encouraged to do as much as their resources 
				will allow. The vignettes are often more specific in naming and describing resources 
				because this level of detail helps others to understand the context and pedagogical 
				use of technology more clearly. The vignettes attempt to offer free and open-source
				technology alternatives where possible, and in some instances they suggest 
				technology for the physically disabled. We encourage teachers and teacher educators 
				to use the vignettes as examples of how to use technology appropriately in language 
				teaching. Although the vignettes tend to focus on English language learning and 
				teaching, the technology standards can be applied to languages other than English.

				<h3>
					Defining Technology
				</h3>

				<p>
					We use the term <em>technology</em> in this book to refer to systems that rely on computer 
					chips, digital applications, and networks in all their forms. This includes not only 
					desktop and laptop computers but also a wide range of electronic devices such as 
					DVD players, data projectors, and interactive whiteboards. Our use of <em>technology</em> also 
					includes computer-driven mobile devices such as cell phones, smart phones, personal 
					digital assistants (PDAs), and MP3 players. 
				</p>

				<p>
					We also make frequent use of the terms <em>digital</em>, <em>electronic</em>, and <em>CALL</em>, or
					computer-assisted language learning. Although many alternative acronyms have arisen, such 
					as TELL (technology-enhanced language learning) and CALI (computer-assisted 
					language instruction), the acronym CALL has been the most consistently used. It 
					appears in the names of professional associations and special interest groups such 
					as TESOL’s CALL Interest Section, APACALL, EuroCALL, PacCALL, JALTCALL, and 
					WorldCALL. As a result, CALL is the term used consistently in this book to refer to the 
					use of computers and digital technologies in language learning.
				</p>

				<p>
					A glossary and a complete index in Part 4 further assist the reader in understanding 
					the terminology and acronyms used throughout this book.

				<h3>
					Organization of This Book
				</h3>

				<p>
					This book is divided into four major parts.
				</p>

				<h4>
					Part 1: Description
				</h4>

				<p>
					<strong>Chapter 1</strong> introduces the technology standards and provides an overview of the rest 
					of the book. <strong>Chapter 2</strong> references the second language acquisition and
					computer-assisted language learning research that informs the standards. This information 
					comes from a rich and diverse research base that includes investigation into the 
					teaching of individual language skills as well as insight into different environmental 
					and delivery methods that have become common in language teaching and 
					learning. Becoming familiar with the research base will help those who would like 
					to understand why the standards are important for effective language teaching and 
					learning.
				</p>

				<h4>
					Part 2: Implementation
				</h4>

				<p>
					Part 2, Implementation, provides the information needed to begin to implement the 
					standards in teaching and learning.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="hidden">Hidden debug</span><strong>Chapter 3</strong>, Technology Standards for Language Learners, includes three overarching 
					goals, each with two to five standards, plus performance indicators that delineate 
					how the standards are applied. Each standard includes at least one vignette to serve as 
					an example of how the standards and indicators are put into classroom practice in a 
					variety of settings.
				</p>

				</div>

<!-- Page 5 -->

				<p>
					<strong>Chapter 4</strong>, Technology Standards for Language Teachers, includes four overarching 
					goals, each with three to five standards, plus performance indicators and at least one 
					vignette for each standard. The goals and standards are not meant to be sequential. 
					Standard 3 is not intended to be more difficult than Standard 2 nor easier than 
					Standard 4, for example. Instead, the standards are intended to be complementary 
					and, at times, overlapping because each focuses on a different goal.
				</p>

				<p>
					Note: For a quick reference list of the goals, standards, and performance indicators 
					minus the vignettes, see Appendix A.
				</p>

				<p>
					In <strong>Chapter 5</strong>, the TESOL Technology Standards are compared to two other
					well-known technology standards documents: 
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						ISTE NETS: the International Society for Technology in Education’s National
		      Educational Technology Standards
		     </li>

		     <li>
		      UNESCO ICT-CST: the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural
		      Organization’s Information and Communication Technologies Competency 
		      Standards for Teachers
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Although there are many similarities among the three documents, all of which share 
					an interest in technology in education, the TESOL Technology Standards are targeted 
					to an international audience specifically composed of language teachers and learners. 
					There is a clear focus in the TESOL Technology Standards on language pedagogy and 
					learning, rather than solely on technology. Language educators who have used ISTE 
					NETS can take advantage of the concordance to find TESOL Technology Standards 
					that meet the demands of a standards-based curriculum and that are relevant to the 
					more specific context of language teaching and learning. 
				</p>

				<h4>
					Part 3: Integration
				</h4>

				<p>
					Part 3 offers guidance for specific categories of readers who are ready to make the 
					technology standards a central part of their institutions, their teacher education and 
					training programs, and their teaching. Separate chapters address teacher educators, 
					administrators, and online teachers, and the section concludes with can-do checklists 
					for self-assessment and program assessment. 
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="hidden">Hidden debug</span><strong>Chapter 6</strong>, for teacher educators, examines the standards with a focus on 
					implications for teacher preparation programs and in-service teacher training. This 
					overview of the state of teacher preparation provides context for both the teacher and 
					the student standards. 
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="hidden">Hidden debug</span><strong>Chapter 7</strong>, for administrators, addresses ways to implement the standards across 
					the curriculum in a variety of settings. It suggests global needs, such as ongoing 
					teacher development with technology and appropriate compensation for teachers 
					who serve as de facto or recognized technology experts. The vignettes in this chapter 
					demonstrate how administrators in low-, medium-, and high-resource settings can 
					help teachers meet the goals for the learner and the teacher standards.

				<p>
					<strong>Chapter 8</strong> addresses the implications of the standards for fully online teaching and 
					for teaching in a blended/hybrid environment, part face-to-face and part online. The 
					fundamental premise is that good online teaching has the same overall characteristics 
					as good teaching in a face-to-face environment, with a few shifts in focus. After a 
					review of the underpinnings of successful online teaching and learning, the chapter 
					examines the implications of each standard for online learning. 
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="hidden">Hidden debug</span><strong>Chapter 9</strong> provides checklists for self-assessment and program assessment for those 
					who are interested in examining their own practice and settings. The self-assessments 
					consist of a series of can-do statements that serve as behavioral objectives, based 
					on the performance indicators in each standard. The program assessment is geared 
					toward administrators and other stakeholders with an interest in ensuring that a 
					program complies with the standards. These rubrics are designed to be aids to meeting 
					the standards rather than absolute prescriptions, given the wide variety of available 
					technology and pedagogical needs demanded by the different users of this book.
				</p>

				<h4>
					Part 4: Supporting Matter 
				</h4>

				<p>
					Part 4 consists of a variety of supporting information. 
				</p>

				<p>
					The <strong>Glossary</strong> offers brief explanations for many of the technical terms used in the 
					book, both from language pedagogy and from technology. 
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="hidden">Hidden debug</span><strong>Appendix A</strong> is intended as a quick reference for the TESOL Technology Standards. It 
					repeats all the goals, standards, and performance indicators for the teacher standards 
					and the learner standards from Chapters 3 and 4, but minus the vignettes.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="hidden">Hidden debug</span><strong>Appendix B</strong> cross-references three sets of language proficiency definitions referenced 
					by the vignettes:
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						TESOL’s <em>Standards for Adult Education ESL Programs</em> (2003)
					</li>

					<li>
						TESOL’s <em>PreK–12 English Language Proficiency Standards</em> (2006)
					</li>

					<li>
						Council of Europe’s Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) for languages (2010)
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					<strong>Appendix C</strong> lists the vignettes from Chapters 3 and 4 by standard and gives the 
					context, learner profile, and skill/focus area for each vignette, as well as suggesting 
					the types of technology employed. Readers are encouraged to use these vignette 
					tables to find examples of classroom practice in different contexts and using different 
					technologies.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="hidden">Hidden debug</span><strong>About the Authors and Contributors</strong> gives credit where credit is due, recognizing 
					the Technology Standards Task Force that was responsible for the overall content of this 
					volume; the Vignette Team members who edited, organized, selected, and wrote many 
					of the vignettes; and the other individuals who contributed vignettes to this volume.
				</p>

				<p>
					Finally, the <strong>Index</strong> is designed to help readers search quickly for information relevant 
					to their particular contexts and to find specific topics of interest.
