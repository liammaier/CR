			<h2>
				Online Teaching and Learning With the Technology Standards
			</h2>

			<p class="chapterSummary">
				This chapter focuses on ways to apply the standards to online teaching. 
				It indicates the implications of each standard for those involved in 
				online teaching, learning, and administration.
			</p>

			<p>
				This chapter focuses on issues in fully online courses. However, the information also 
				applies to hybrid courses that include both online and face-to-face components. 
				Fundamentally, good online teaching is good teaching. The TESOL Technology 
				Standards apply to all teaching settings, including online environments. That said, 
				certain elements take on added importance in fully online environments. These 
				include creating an effective technology infrastructure, setting the learning environment 
				appropriately, managing time, and establishing teacher and learner presence.

			<h3>
				Technology Infrastructure
			</h3>

			<p>
				In an online course, technology is the infrastructure. Teachers need to fully understand 
				the electronic learning environment and to have a basic level of skill with the tools 
				that they use regularly, such as a course management system or videoconferencing 
				tool. Learners need to have access to explicit instruction in how to use the course tools. 
				This generally includes information in a variety of formats (text, graphics, video). Both 
				teachers and learners need regular, skilled technical support that is available through 
				multiple routes (California State University, Chico, 2009). It does not help a learner 
				to have a tech support website when the Internet is not working; a phone number or 
				other offline means of contact has to be available as well. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Teachers in an online course need to be well aware that a technical problem for the 
				learner can prevent his or her participation in the course. The learner’s frustration 
				grows with each day that the course or a needed component is not available. 
				Learners may be working in isolation rather than as part of a cohort, which feeds the 
				frustration when something does not work. As much as possible, teachers need to be 
				responsive to problems that prevent learners from participating fully in the course 
				(Fish & Wickersham, 2009). These problems can include software upgrades that

			<p>
				prevent a course element from functioning on a learner’s computer, a missing browser 
				plug-in, a file-naming convention that does not work on all types of computers, 
				different versions of word-processing software, and times when the Internet is not 
				available. Blocked websites are a problem in some countries where the government 
				has taken offense or wishes to make a political statement by preventing access to 
				certain websites. (See Helft & Wines, 2010, on Google and China, for example.) Quick 
				responses and flexibility in the face of these obstacles are a must, especially when 
				online learners are in distant settings.
			</p>

			<p>
				Internet safety is a very large consideration in online courses. Learners and teachers 
				need to be on the alert for viruses and other harmful programs (malware) on their 
				computers that could be passed to others through shared files. When email addresses 
				appear on a website or other publicly visible place online, they may become the 
				target of false and fraudulent email messages (spam). Young learners are particularly 
				vulnerable to online predators. Special caution needs to be taken to protect the 
				personal information and photos of young learners online. 
			</p>

			<p>
				One very positive element in online courses is access to adaptive technology, 
				including assistive devices for those with physical disabilities. Screen readers that 
				translate text to speech, speech recognition software, the ability to increase the size of 
				print, and alternative input devices—these and more are available to online learners. 
				For best results, websites and other online information should be created in 
				accordance with the Principles of Universal Design: “the design of products and 
				environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the 
				need for adaptation or specialized design” ([Center for Universal Design, 2010, 
				para. 1] http://www.ncsu.edu/www/ncsu/design/sod5/cud/about_ud/udprinciples
				text.htm). Websites and materials created appropriately can readily be used with 
				assistive devices as needed. 
			</p>

			<h3>
				Learning Environment
			</h3>

			<p>
				A positive learning environment has a number of attributes. Students feel safe 
				to express their ideas in a positive environment, and they feel supported by their 
				classmates, or colleagues, and the teacher. In addition, students are aware of what 
				they are supposed to do, when, and how. Most online environments cannot get by on 
				the force of the teacher’s personality. In many fully online courses, the teacher is not 
				present much of the time that learning is going on. Learners are expected to be getting 
				as much if not more from their collaborations with each other in discussions and 
				on tasks. 
			</p>

			<p>
				For optimum learning, the online environment should be one that supports 
				interaction and collaboration among learners, creating a learning community 
				(Karayan & Crowe, 1997; Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2000). Interaction often takes 
				place through asynchronous online discussion and may also include synchronous 
				tools such as chat, interactive whiteboards, audioconferencing, or videoconferencing. 
				The learning environment should include a method to share resources for lessons

			<p>
				(following appropriate copyright laws) and to collect and share student work. 
				Collaboration can be enabled by file-sharing. Sharing can be enabled through 
				individual email, file-sharing websites (e.g., Google Sites [Google, 2010g] at http://
				sites.google.com), or a school’s file server. The course designer may be working with 
				a standard course management system such as Moodle, Sakai, or Blackboard. The 
				instructor may also include different stand-alone elements to enable asynchronous 
				and synchronous discussion and file- and resource-sharing (Educause, 2010).
			</p>

			<p>
				Teachers need to be aware of how students are using the environment and work 
				actively to promote appropriate use. They should offer opportunities for students 
				to apply different learning strategies, in terms of media, format, and collaboration 
				(Illinois Online Network, 2010; San Juan College, 2008). The teacher sets the stage, 
				provides resources, models interaction, and moves interactions in the learning 
				environment forward in a positive way. In order to be effective, teachers in online 
				learning environments need to be supported with ongoing training, adequate 
				time for preparation and participation, appropriate class size, and appropriate 
				remuneration (Colwell & Jenks, 2004). A class of 50–75 students, whether online or 
				face-to-face, will not have the same learning outcomes as a class of 15–20. A change 
				in platform does not create a change in the work. Fifty essays in electronic format take 
				as long to read and grade as 50 essays on paper.
			</p>

			<h3>
				Time
			</h3>
			
			<p>
				Many adult students are involved in online courses because they need to juggle 
				conflicting demands of study, work, and family. They need a clear timeline so that 
				other aspects of their lives can be scheduled appropriately to the extent possible. 
				Planning ahead is essential in order to provide deadlines that can be met and that 
				learners can count on (Shi, Bonk, & Magjuka, 2006; Fish & Wickersham, 2009). The 
				teacher in a face-to-face class can take a quick look around the classroom to see who 
				is ready to move on from one activity to the next. The quick look is not an option in 
				an asynchronous online class. Some flexibility is possible, but it needs to be built into 
				course descriptions and expectations. Ideally, the teacher will poll students before 
				changing the schedule to make sure the revisions will work for everyone.
			</p>

			<p>
				Synchronous, real-time activities (e.g., chat, collaborative whiteboards, and interactive 
				presentations) are readily available options in settings with geographically similar 
				learners. World Clock ([Time and Date, 2010a] http://www.timeanddate.com) and 
				especially World Clock Meeting Planner ([Time and Date, 2010b] http://www.timeand
				date.com/worldclock/meeting.html) can be very helpful in setting times that will 
				work with geographically dispersed learners. Text chat is generally available even to 
				learners in areas with poor Internet access. Other synchronous tools, however, may 
				be out of the reach of learners outside of areas with high-speed Internet connections. 
				Any synchronous activity requires advance notice and planning so that all learners 
				have an equal opportunity to participate.

			<h3>
				Teacher and Learner Presence
			</h3>

			<p>
				An area of ongoing research in online education is that of <em>presence</em>, typically described 
				as social presence, teaching presence, and cognitive presence. Presence is at the 
				heart of creating a community of inquiry, which is one direction to take in creating 
				a learning environment. The three presences are described extensively in Garrison, 
				Anderson, and Archer (2000). A diagram showing the interaction of the three 
				presences to create the online educational experience is shown in Figure 8.1.
			</p>

			<p>
				The teacher’s role is to set up structures and processes for a successful learning 
				environment. This includes selecting content, setting the climate, and encouraging 
				appropriate discourse (Cini & Vilic, 2004). Learners and teachers work together 
				to create <em>social presence</em> in the course, where learners feel comfortable with their 
				interactions with others. Including a place to share photos, a purely social discussion 
				thread, and other nonacademic options can enhance social presence and the 
				willingness to learn. In a face-to-face class, this would be seen as lowering the affective 
				filter (Krashen, 1981, and many others). 
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>Cognitive presence</em> refers to the teaching and learning components in a course or 
				a community of inquiry. Socializing motivates and intensifies the educational 
				experience and creates the context in which students learn best. However, content 
				also needs to be available for learning to take place. If there is little or no exposure 
				to meaningful language data, language learning is unlikely to happen. The teacher, 
				usually also the course designer, is central to providing cognitive presence in an 
				online course.

			<p>
				<em>Teaching presence</em> is the visibility of the teacher in the community. The teacher is one 
				part of the community. It is relatively easy to replicate a teacher-dominated class 
				online, where the teacher initiates, responds to, critiques, and grades all activity.
				Such a teacher-dominated class offers little chance to develop student autonomy for
				self-sustaining, lifelong learning. The teacher-centered class also does not enable adequate 
				socializing to prepare students for team-based workplaces. On the other hand, 
				students learn better when they feel they have adequate feedback from instructors on 
				their work in the course (Fish & Wickersham, 2009).

				Conclusion
			</h3>

			<p>
				This chapter has examined the implications of the TESOL Technology Standards for 
				online teaching and learning. The technology standards are particularly applicable to 
				online courses because technology is a routine part of teaching and learning in such 
				settings. With hybrid (partially online and partially face-to-face) courses, technology 
				needs to be blended effectively in order to produce high-quality learning. Online 
				teaching is more than transferring a face-to-face course into digital mode. Online 
				educators need to be aware of the effects of having technology as the infrastructure 
				for a course, the centrality of establishing a productive learning environment, and
