			<h2>
				Technology Standards for Language Learners
			</h2>

			<p class="chapterSummary">
				This chapter contains three overarching goals and a total of 11 
				standards. Performance indicators and at least one vignette are included 
				for each standard. The performance indicators and the vignettes pertain 
				to a range of settings, English proficiency levels, and learner ages.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Technology Standards for Language Learners consist of three overarching goals, 
				each with two to five standards. The goals and standards are not listed hierarchically; 
				each standard is independently important. The standards are not meant to be 
				sequential. Standard 3 is not intended to be more difficult than Standard 2 or easier 
				than Standard 4, for example.
			</p>

			<p>
				Each standard includes four to six performance indicators that pertain to a range of 
				settings—including high-access or low-resource; English as a second language (ESL) 
				or English as a foreign language (EFL); face-to-face, hybrid, or fully online; child or 
				adult; and general English or English for specific purposes (ESP), including academic 
				English. Some performance indicators specify a particular setting, such as young 
				learners or fully online.
			</p>

			<p>
				For the examples that appear within the performance indicators, an effort has been 
				made to avoid the use of technical language and the brand names of hardware and 
				software. Using generic references throughout takes into account the rapidly changing 
				nature of technology and enables this book to remain current.
			</p>

			<p>
				The vignettes included with each standard are designed to put a human face on 
				the standards, demonstrating how they are applied in real contexts. Each vignette 
				includes examples of how the standard is applied in low-resource, low-access; 
				medium-resource, medium-access; and high-resource, high-access settings. Across the 
				standards, the vignettes cover a range of English proficiency levels and learner ages 
				(children, teenagers, adults), as well as varied settings (including EFL, ESL, intensive 
				English programs [IEPs], adult workplace English, academic and professional ESP, 
				one-computer classroom, class-lab, and fully online). To be as immediately useful

			<p>
				as possible, the vignettes include examples of current technology applications and 
				websites, as well as reference to recent articles on the pedagogies involved.
			</p>
				
			<p>
				Despite the specific contexts of the vignettes, the concepts and practices they 
				illustrate can be applied over a much wider set of classroom and laboratory contexts. 
				Readers are encouraged to envision how the technologies and activities illustrated in 
				particular vignettes can apply in their own settings.

					<tr>
						<td>
							Learner profile:

			<p>
				The vignettes provide examples and inspiration for teachers, teacher educators, and 
				administrators who would like to do more with technology in language teaching 
				and learning.
			</p>
				
			<p>
				For handy reference, Appendix C contains tables listing the vignettes by goal and 
				standard, along with their language focus and the technology used.

			<p>
				We encourage those who are working with technology in various contexts to continue 
				to contribute their own vignettes to help expand the knowledge base available to 
				educators. Follow the vignettes provided in this book as a template for organizing 
				your vignette. Vignettes can be emailed to Deborah Healey, dhealey@uoregon.edu,

				<h6>
					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					EFL teenage students in a developing country’s English-medium school have received 
					their first computer access. They will be introduced to the computer in an “each 
					one teach one” format, while the teacher and more experienced students become 
					the coaches on the side. Before the lesson starts, the teacher has prepared a paper 
					template of the computer keyboard (or an overhead transparency or slide, where 
					a computer projector is available) with the basic function keys highlighted: e.g., 
					Power switch, Ctrl (the Control key, or the Command key for Apple computers), 
					Enter (Return), Backspace, Delete (sometimes Del), Shift. The teacher reviews these 
					commands before students approach the computer, making sure they know the 
					names in both English and their native language. The teacher has also prepared a 
					“cheat sheet” with common software shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl-S for saving a file, Ctrl-C to 
					copy, Ctrl-V to paste, etc.) for the word-processing or other software to be used. One 
					sheet will be kept next to each computer. After basic commands are mastered, brightly 
					colored posters with information about commands for specific software are hung 
					around the room. These are created by the students themselves and are bilingual to 
					assist in rapid access.
				</p>

				<p>
					Using the paper template, the teacher takes two students to the computer, walking 
					them through the basic commands, including opening and saving a word-processed 
					file. The first student then sits at the keyboard and performs all the functions with 
					oral directions (as needed) from the teacher, who does not touch the keyboard after 
					the initial demonstration. Using the paper template allows the student to work at his/
					her level of comfort and prevents the teacher from inadvertently instilling computer 
					phobia by preempting the initial exploratory movements. The initial essay prompt is 
					to write three sentences in English describing the other student in the pair. This gives 
					the student the opportunity to explore the QWERTY keyboard. The first student then 
					stands behind the other student, who performs all the functions with the first student 
					coaching as needed. Again, the first student must give only oral directions, using the 
					template if necessary. Directions may be given in English or in the native language, 
					depending on the level of the students, but the teacher uses English and encourages 
					the students to coach in English while they are performing at the keyboard. Each 
					student saves the electronic file to a folder created by the teacher on the computer. 
					This folder will be the basis of the student’s electronic portfolio.

<!-- Page 21 -->

				<p>
					During subsequent lessons, students will watch the teacher start the computer, and 
					then log in to their own account (if appropriate), open a word processor or other 
					software used in class, write a short essay or perform exercises as required, save a file 
					to the appropriate folder, and exit the program. Students will be coached by each 
					other in pairs, both orally and using the template, but the student coach will not 
					take the keyboard away from the seated student. The teacher is consulted only when 
					a problem arises, thus providing the teacher much-needed time to give attention to 
					other students in the class who are working on other lessons. Students have multiple 
					opportunities to observe computer operation before undertaking it themselves 
					and have hands-on access with help for troubleshooting. Thus, they can overcome 
					any computer phobia and can begin the process of mastery in a safe learning 
					environment. After all students have used the computer, the teacher presents a short 
					written or oral quiz, asking about the uses of the different function keys. A similar 
					approach may be used each time a new program is introduced, including use of an 
					Internet browser and email program. (For more on getting students started with the 
					Internet, see Gaer, 2007.)

				<h5>
					Low-resource, low-access setting
				</h5>
					
				<p>
					With one computer in the classroom, no Internet access, and no computer projector, 
					students work in rotating pairs at the keyboard with the paper template in the “each 
					one teach one” format described above. Once these two students seem comfortable, 
					the first student returns to the class, and the second now becomes the coach to two 
					new students, one seated at the computer and the other watching, as described 
					above, and so on until the entire class has had a chance to use the computer and 
					coach another student. The teacher creates a paper quiz on keyboard and computer 
					functions. Students in pairs or triads access the classroom computer regularly to 
					create drawings, write short papers, or engage in grammar exercises or games, which 
					the teacher loads with a portable memory stick or creates at the computer with Hot 
					Potatoes (Half-Baked Software, 2010, http://hotpot.uvic.ca) or a similar program.
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting
				</h5>
					
				<p>
					With an overhead or computer projector, and one computer with Internet access for 
					every three or four students, the teacher will introduce the basic activities of logging 
					on, opening an application, typing, and so on, using an overhead projector (OHP) 
					transparency, slideshow, or screencast video to highlight the most important keys 
					and functions. Students will then move to the computers and use the “each one teach 
					one” approach to perform the initial assignments. The teacher creates a short online 
					quiz that students can take when they feel ready. The teacher then has students use 
					their new computer literacy skills while performing a WebQuest (see Dodge, 2007, for 
					existing quests) in which students follow links to specific locations.
				</p>
					
				<p>
					When students are confident in typing links, following a trail of links, and using 
					and creating bookmarks for their finds, they will be introduced to the local email 
					application. They will review the sites they have found and compose email to each 
					other, sending copies to the teacher, describing in brief the sites they have found.

				<h5>
					High-resource, high-access setting

				<p>
					With a set of laptops or a computer lab and a projector, the teacher introduces the 
					whole class to the basic function keys with a slideshow or screencast video (or an 
					electronic whiteboard), highlighting the most important keys and functions within 
					the word processor or other software program. The teacher then takes the students 
					to the computer stations, where they follow the teacher from station to station. After 
					viewing the activity at two or three stations, many students are able to continue on 
					their own computer stations, where they work in pairs using the “each one teach 
					one” approach to complete the assignments as above. The teacher creates a short 
					online quiz that students can take when they feel ready. Students practice their new 
					computer skills as above, using individual laptops to perform parts of tasks, and 
					reporting back as a team.

				<h5>
					Background
				</h5>

				<p>
					In an adult education English language literacy context in North America, students 
					often have access to computers and the Internet and can improve their English 
					literacy skills while learning basic computer operations. Prior to any instruction in 
					this area, the teacher assesses students’ fundamental knowledge about computers. 
					Students have a range from nonliterate in their native language to some functional 
					literacy in English, and some have moderate visual disabilities, so computer skills 
					can be evaluated in a variety of verbal or nonverbal ways such as a self-assessment, 
					functional quiz, or observational activity. In the example below, 20 adult immigrant 
					students representing five different languages are functionally literate in their native 
					language and are enrolled as beginning English language students in conjunction 
					with a life skills/study skills course.
				</p>

				<p>
					Students first watch the teacher perform basic operating functions while the teacher 
					speaks the commands out loud. These include turning the computer on and off, 
					opening the word processor and typing in a new document, cutting and pasting, 
					and saving a file. The teacher also shows how to use keyboard shortcuts to change 
					font size for better readability (especially important for visually impaired students). 
					Each student has a handout of the commands for a visual reference. Next, student 
					volunteers read the commands on the list and watch the teacher perform the 
					functions. Finally, students come up in pairs and perform the functions on the class 
					computer as the teacher calls them out. Students are allowed time to discuss with one 
					another before responding. In the final phase, students volunteer in pairs, alternating 
					between the role of the one who gives the command and the one who performs 
					the task in front of the class. For the visually impaired, the school has provided 
					software (e.g., a text-to-speech reader, such as ReadPlease [ReadPlease Corporation, 
					1999–2005], and a speech-to-text writer, such as Dragon NaturallySpeaking [Nuance 
					Communications, 2010]). By the end of the class session, students are thoroughly 
					familiar with the commands orally, in writing, and as icons on the desktop and 
					within the program. (For more help with tutorials for adult students, see Tips for 
					Using Technology [Hopelink Education, 2009]; http://www.eastsideliteracy.org
					/tutorsupport/Tech/TechTips.htm.)

<!-- Page 23 -->

				<p>
					In subsequent lessons, the students watch video clips of people describing how to 
					perform basic computer operations, including how to use a presentation program. 
					Video tutorials may be found at many sites online, for example, at Microsoft 2007 
					Office Tutorials (Microsoft, 2007, http://www.officetutorials.com/). The teacher 
					can also make her own tutorials at home using free screencast software. The teacher 
					ensures that the tutorials include specific descriptions that will help the visually 
					impaired students, who will also use a screen magnifier purchased by the school. The 
					teacher has loaded these clips from a portable memory device if the Internet is not 
					available in class and is careful to check for download permission first. In groups or 
					pairs, students choose up to six new commands to peer-teach through video clips 
					or graphics (e.g., from clip art or created with a drawing program) that show how 
					the word processor or presentation software works. They use the teacher’s or their 
					own phone video camera, a video camcorder, or a class digital camera, if available, 
					to record video of each other at the computer. They can also create videos with 
					screencast software. The teacher demonstrates how to embed the art and video clips in 
					their presentations. Then the teacher helps, or has more technologically experienced 
					students help, each group complete a three-slide presentation demonstrating a basic 
					computing function command illustrated with clip art, a picture drawn with the 
					computer’s graphics program, or a short video clip. The video demonstrations they 
					create are archived for students in other classes to use as examples.

				<h5>
					Low-resource, low-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					In a classroom with one computer and a data projector, students practice the 
					computer and word processor commands as described above, watching the teacher 
					perform them with the computer and projector. They later take turns in small groups 
					or pairs using the classroom computer for creating their own art- or video-enhanced 
					presentations. While the teacher helps students at the workstation, the other students 
					work on other assignments. When the presentations are complete, the student 
					groups present them to each other, using the class computer and projector with the 
					teacher’s help.
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					In a computer lab with no Internet connection, students follow the teacher’s 
					modeling of the functions and vocabulary as discussed above. After the teacher 
					demonstration, students work in pairs at the computers, giving and carrying out 
					commands for 10 more minutes while the teacher circulates around the class listening 
					in on their activity. After every student has had a chance to type a few words and save 
					a file in the word processor, the teacher provides a second demonstration related to 
					the basic functions of presentation software, as described above. Each pair of students 
					then creates and saves a three-slide presentation, as described above. Students walk 
					around the class, and each pair demonstrates its show in turn.

				<h5>
					High-resource, high-access setting

				<p>
					With Internet access for each student in a classroom lab and a video camera, students 
					benefit from the teacher’s modeling and guiding as above, with the addition of 
					lessons on opening and closing the browser, getting online, using URLs, web safety, 
					and so on. The teacher helps visually impaired students find and open a web page 
					reader (e.g., BrowseAloud [TextHelp Systems, 2010], http://www.browsealoud.com
					/page.asp) and downloads it to one of the workstations for their use. After achieving 
					familiarity with the basic operating functions and associated oral commands, 
					students proceed with word-processing and presentation software, creating their 
					demonstrations, as they work in pairs at the computers over several lab sessions. They 
					use art found on the web or clip art on their computers. They may also go to other 
					tutorial sites to study more advanced uses of software and web tools. They present 
					their work, either through the computer projector or as a gallery walk, as described in 
					the other settings above.

					Background
				</h5>

				<p>
					In an ESL class with 12 students representing four languages, students prepare a 5- to 
					7-minute speech about their favorite native-language song. Before the assignment is 
					begun, the instructor gives a class demonstration on multimedia setup (e.g., how to 
					connect devices by cable or wireless to their computer; how to embed a recording 
					in their presentation as needed) and a short speech on a favorite song to provide an 
					example. The teacher points out how to reference sources and reminds students about 
					appropriate citations.
				</p>

				<p>
					To activate native-language schemata and promote fluency, the instructor asks that 
					students include a summary of the lyrics, why they enjoy the song, and information 
					on the artist. Students will then prepare speeches in English that include this

					with cables or wireless, how to open and close media players, how to run security 
					software, and how to use the computer projector, if available. (For more on using 
					music to teach language, see Beasley and Chuang, 2008.)

					In a classroom with one computer and one set of speakers, students are assigned 
					their presentations as homework. The teacher asks that each student bring a copy of 
					the song via a CD/DVD, MP3 player, or portable memory device. During a student’s 
					assigned turn, he or she will come to the front of the class, load the chosen media 
					(with teacher assistance, if needed), and open the song with the proper media 
					software. Once the speech is finished, the student will be expected to properly close 
					running software and remove the media hardware.
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					In a computer lab with no Internet connection, the instructor assigns students the 
					presentation as homework. The students are to discuss why they enjoy the song and 
					provide photos or video clips that illustrate their feelings or ideas about the music.

					They download the media at an Internet café or from their mobile phones. Students 
					then prepare the summary and biography using presentation software. Each slide 
					will include a short text description or comment. If equipment is available, students 
					may add a short clip from the song via their recorder or MP3 player, with proper 
					attribution. With teacher assistance, as needed, students use the scanner to copy 
					photos and mobile devices to upload clips (e.g., with cables or wireless) as they work 
					in the lab. More experienced students help those who are just beginning to use the 
					media devices and software. Students are required, prior to speaking, to set up their 
					song for play at the end of the speech and to load their presentation, which has been 
					saved to the computer. Four students will be selected to give speeches at computer 
					stations in the four corners of the room, with the remaining students listening to each 
					speech via a gallery walk from computer station to computer station in small groups. 
					Students cycle through turns until everyone has spoken.
				</p>

				<h5>
					High-resource, high-access setting 
				</h5>

				<p>
					In a classroom lab with computers for all students, Internet access, and computer 
					projector, students have been assigned to create an online blog (web + log) that 
					will include media (linked or uploaded from a digital camera, scanner, or mobile 
					device) that presents their interpretation of a favorite song; students are also asked 
					to link their summary and biography to the song or lyrics online. Before the oral 
					presentation, students are asked to post questions or comments on the blogs of three 
					classmates. The teacher assists them with the media, browser, and blog operation, as 
					needed. In class, students show their blog via the computer projector (or in a gallery 
					walk as in the previous section) and explain why they chose particular images or 
					media. After giving their speech and playing their selected song, students answer any 
					remaining questions that have not been posted and answered on their blogs.

				<h5>
					Background
				</h5>

				<p>
					Just as they do with real-life dangers, students learn to assess the risks of accessing 
					Internet sites. They learn to evaluate statements made online, whether people are 
					who they say they are when engaging in online communications, and how much 
					information about themselves they should give. The language teacher gradually 
					introduces Internet security management so that young learners will eventually 
					be able to make appropriate decisions when they are at home or using the web in 
					some other unsupervised location. Lessons begin with highly managed access to the 
					Internet: The teacher creates a set of bookmarks that students are allowed to use. 
					Computers are arranged in the class or lab so that the monitors are visible to the 
					teacher or lab assistant, and student activity can be easily viewed. Young learners are 
					given cartoons showing various situations in which they must determine the real 
					and the false, e.g., the Big Bad Wolf pretending to be Grandmother. The teacher leads 
					a discussion in which students brainstorm safety rules based on typical childhood 
					warnings such as “Don’t talk to strangers” and discuss “What if . . .” situations (e.g., 
					“What if someone online asks for your telephone number?” or “Do people always tell 
					their real name and age on the web?”).
				</p>

				<p>
					These lessons are reviewed whenever students are going to explore the web. The 
					teacher reminds students not to click on ads or commercials. The teacher and 
					students brainstorm rules for safe web use and create colorful posters (these may 
					be bilingual for ease of access) to remind themselves to be cautious. Students are 
					taught to ask for adult assistance whenever a site requests a password or personal 
					information, and parents are given information packets in their home language about 
					Internet safety to use at home. The teacher uses the brochure and posters from the 
					Council of Europe explaining children’s rights (Council of Europe, 2010a) and has 
					students use an online safety game on the Internet, such as Through the Wild Web 
					Woods (Council of Europe, 2009, in 14 languages; http://www.wildwebwoods.org).
				</p>

				<p>
					Whether in a classroom or lab, the computers are placed where the teacher can 
					easily see the monitors, and pairs or triads of students work as a team to perform 
					a WebQuest (a guided search through Internet sites; Dodge, 2007) about Internet 
					safety for children. (For sample links, see Internet Safety: Using Our Seat Belt Online 
					[Najarian, n.d.], http://questgarden.com/81/47/9/090502174626/.) Students take

					notes or print out their findings, if possible, to use in writing their reports. The teacher 
					helps students understand bookmarks and helps them develop an organization for 
					bookmarking the sites that the team finds. 
				</p>

				<p>
					As students become Internet savvy, the teacher will assign them work on an 
					international collaborative project (both email and web-based) at a safe site, such as 
					iEARN (2011, http://www.iearn.org) or GLOBE (UCAR Community Programs, 2010, 
					http://www.globe.gov; the teacher must attend a GLOBE workshop beforehand). 
					The teacher assists students in logging on and in using resources at the main site, 
					demonstrating these processes with a computer projector (where available) to the 
					whole class before students access their computers in pairs or triads to upload 
					materials. The teacher trains students to help each other with site access, as needed, 
					and reminds them not to give out passwords or personal information while browsing. 
					Students are instructed to seek adult assistance whenever a site demands a password 
					or personal information. The teacher assists students in logging off the computers 
					completely so that their data remains safe. Students evaluate their team’s work at the 
					end of each activity. (For a description of the GLOBE program, see Kennedy, 2006.)

				<h5>
					Low-resource, low-access setting
				</h5>
					
				<p>
					With one computer, Internet access, and, if possible, a printer in the classroom, pairs 
					or triads of students take turns performing the WebQuest, taking notes on paper (or 
					printing out their findings, if possible) to use in writing their reports. At the beginning 
					of the rotated computer use, the teacher reminds students of safety precautions. 
					When the WebQuest tasks are completed, students change places with another pair 
					or triad and begin writing their reports at their seats. The teacher monitors the screen 
					occasionally as students work. Students join an international group project as a whole 
					class, with teams performing various parts of their joint task. 
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting 
				</h5>

				<p>
					With a computer projector and several students sharing multiple computers in the 
					classroom or a lab, students are led through the discussions and web search activities 
					previously described, alternating access to the computers in teams with individual 
					work on paper for their projects.
				</p>

				<h5>
					High-resource, high-access setting 
				</h5>

				<p>
					With an interactive whiteboard (or computer and projector) in the classroom and a 
					fully equipped lab with Internet connections, teachers prepare students for access to 
					the projects previously described by leading safety discussions and demonstrating 
					the site access in the classroom before students proceed to the lab. During lab time, 
					students work in pairs or individually, with the teacher monitoring their computer 
					screens. Students take notes in the target language using a word-processing program 
					and/or print their findings to use in writing their reports.

					Management shift employees who work in a fast-food chain attend classes from their 
					place of employment. Innovative multiple-site design allows them to take classes 
					during their regular shift and count them as part of their work hours, which allows 
					them to conveniently access the class and maintain work and personal commitments. 
					The work-based curriculum focuses on critical-thinking skills and problem-solving 
					tasks. Adult students participate in monthly face-to-face training sessions at their work 
					site, where they are first introduced to and then review ways to operate computers, 
					especially log-ins, passwords, and keyboarding skills. Students are taught basic 
					troubleshooting, such as checking for appropriate volume with keyboard controls and 
					accessing the help menu. Students use a typing program on CD for further practice 
					and complete communicative homework assignments, including typical workplace 
					ESL tasks such as answering the phone, taking messages, and asking for clarification. 
					Students practice dialogues using transcripts of typical workplace conversations, and 
					they read and discuss passages from the employee manual. The teacher helps them 
					create individual folders where they can store files recording their progress in writing 
					and speaking. The teacher also helps them understand the differences between the 
					various file types that they are saving into the folders that constitute their portfolios.

					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					Teenagers in an EFL setting are practicing computer skills and learning about safe 
					ways to use the Internet to prepare for a collaborative project at an international 
					educational site, such as iEARN (2011, http://www.iearn.org). While students are 
					already somewhat familiar with computer hardware, they are learning how to do 
					some basic troubleshooting and how to problem-solve with easily accessible tools, 
					such as the computer’s Help menu. They also are learning about Internet etiquette 
					(netiquette) and ways to be responsible online while preserving their own privacy. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Using large paper templates of the computer keyboard and monitor provided by the 
					teacher, students locate the power key of their monitor and of the computer processor 
					itself (in newer machines these may be the same), as well as the function keys to 
					change monitor brightness and sound level. They take turns demonstrating, for 
					example, how to find a file on their computer using the appropriate pull-down menu 
					or shortcut key (Control-F or Command-F) and how to move it to a different folder. 
					They point out the Help function in the menu bar. These templates are then posted 
					on a wall for future reference. 
				</p>

				<p>
					In a separate lesson, students explore the Help menu on their own computers with 
					the aid of a teacher-made set of questions, such as “What do I do if the computer 
					freezes?” (search “frozen” in advance to prepare for such a situation) or “How do I 
					log into/out of my computer?” (search “user information”). In a whole-class session, 
					students discuss when such functions will be needed and what kinds of vocabulary 
					they might use for alternate searches. Where the Internet is immediately available, 
					students demonstrate their knowledge of similar functions on the web, e.g., logging 
					into a password-protected site, shutting down the browser, searching the Help menu 
					of their browser. Students also discuss Internet privacy, how to avoid the temptation 
					of flashing ads, and when not to click on a promising, but dubious, commercial.
				</p>

				<p>
					Students discuss netiquette, the rules of polite, respectful communication across 
					international boundaries (see Netiquette for Kids [Boston Public Library, n.d.], http://
					www.bpl.org/kids/netiquette.htm), and they create a list of important features of 
					netiquette for themselves. They take a netiquette quiz based on their discussion. 
					Students also play a game at Internet Safety for Teenagers (Verschoor, 2010; http://

					which raises their awareness of safety and privacy issues. Students learn to 
					turn off the computer if they cannot get rid of offensive distracters.
				</p>

				<p>
					Students are now ready to join an international collaboration. They use what 
					they have learned to log into the collaborative site, transfer information files to 
					their partner school, and communicate respectfully with partner students in other 
					countries. The teacher helps them decide on a project that they can share with 
					another class at the same or similar language level. Students create a personal or 
					(with the help of the teacher) group log-in identity on the class computer and give 
					the log-in information to the teacher for safekeeping. The teacher reminds students to 
					use what they have learned about safety when they are web surfing at home or on a 
					public computer and to remember to use the rules of netiquette as they participate in 
					the international project. (For more on tasks for collaborative learning, see HansonSmith, 2007.)

					Background
				</h5>

				<p>
					Middle and high school students in ESL classes in North America are often from a 
					wide variety of cultural groups and from different countries of origin. As a four-week 
					project, teachers would like these students to get to know each other by exploring 
					different cultural aspects such as the way people greet each other in different 
					languages (verbally and with gestures and body language). Students use technology 
					in order to find their similarities and differences and to begin the exploration of 
					cross-cultural communication while practicing listening, speaking, reading, writing, 
					and digital literacy. Students create a slideshow using Microsoft’s PowerPoint 
					(Microsoft, 2010a) or a free slide maker such as Impress from Openoffice.org (2010, 
					http://www.openoffice.org) with audio and video files as well as text. They present 
					their findings orally while showing their presentations to an adult audience at family 
					night. The teacher leads a discussion on the classroom conventions of teamwork, 
					such as turn taking, ways to show respect for others’ opinions, and ways to arrive 
					at consensus. Students create a checklist to use in their teams. The teacher models 
					how to use various tools, such as video and still digital cameras, a scanner, and 
					computers, and how to upload files from various peripheral devices. The teacher sets 
					up a student-friendly organizational structure of folders on the computer for each 
					team of students. The teacher explains and demonstrates how to cite Internet and 
					library resources. An I-search format (see Macrorie, 1988) may be used for the team 
					as a whole, indicating what is already known, what needs to be learned, and how 
					information is to be found. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Students begin away from the computer, sitting in mixed language groups and 
					exchanging cultural information concerning the ways people greet each other in 
					various languages, including conventions they use with mobile media and the 
					Internet. Students record each other, creating audio or video files to insert into a 
					slideshow presentation. Away from the computer, they meet regularly, creating a 
					flowchart with their ideas for content presentation and planning what areas will 
					need further research on the Internet and in the library. Students keep notes of 
					their work (either on paper or online), and the teacher checks their notes regularly, 
					assisting them with English and with their presentation plan. The teacher’s

					questioning strategies will help students think about cultural differences and what 
					communication conventions are appropriate both face-to-face and more globally.
				</p>

				<p>
					The students then build the slideshow on their team computer, each student working 
					with one or more slides, inserting video, text, graphics, and audio. Teams also discuss 
					how they will present their show and evaluate what they have learned about other 
					cultures through this experience. The teacher coaches them as they practice their oral 
					presentations in English. Students present the slideshows at family night, explaining 
					orally in English what their group was attempting to accomplish with their show 
					and what they learned through the experience. A recording (e.g., on a CD, DVD, or 
					memory stick) of each show is created as an archive or part of a digital portfolio of 
					each team’s work. (See “Learn Basic Computer Skills: How to Burn a CD in Microsoft 
					Windows” [Safronoff, 2007], http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXn3ha6X3Vg.)
				</p>

				<p>
					In the evaluation phase, the teacher asks students several questions that will help 
					them process the importance of bridging cross-cultural communication differences 
					and assess the value of the various tools they have used: Did you enjoy the creative 
					process? What did you learn from it? How well did the team work together? Did 
					cross-cultural differences prevent you from communicating easily at any point? How 
					could you make communication easier? If you could do the activity again, would you 
					do it the same way or differently? Why?

				<p>
					With one computer in the classroom, one headset, and one digital camera (with 
					video capability) available to the school, student teams take turns creating or loading 
					files onto the computer while other teams plan the sequence of slides and their 
					content or research in the library. The teacher checks students’ written notes regularly 
					as part of their English development and to be sure their plans are workable. The 
					teacher (or students) may find digital images appropriate to the presentations and 
					load them on the computer from a portable disk or through mobile media. If a 
					school computer projector is not available, a computer monitor may be hooked to a 
					TV for viewing at family night. The digital archive recording is created either on the 
					class computer or on the teacher’s computer at home. The evaluation survey is done 
					on paper.

					asked to blog regularly about their group’s work. The teacher regularly checks their 
					notes and blogs, both for language instruction and to help with problems in their 
					plan. The teacher presents the evaluative questions with an online survey tool to 
					collect statistics about the activity.

					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					In an adult EFL setting, the instructor wants students to learn about the conventions 
					of personal interaction in different settings (e.g., at a store, at a family dinner, at the 
					bank). The teacher has students interact with each other first in their native language 
					(if the class is monolingual or has groups from the same native language), taking on 
					different roles. Students then analyze their communication choices and engage in 
					role-plays on the same topics in English. Where possible, the teacher brings a native 
					speaker to class to engage in conversation and to respond to students’ questions 
					about social interactions. Students record their role-plays and have the opportunity to 
					review their own performances repeatedly to revise and correct them as their language 
					capability develops. Where the Internet is available, students take part in tandem 
					learning on one of the many free sites available. (For more on tandem learning, see 
					Lewis, 2003, and Elia, 2006.)

					With access to video or audio recorders or a classroom computer, but no access to 
					the Internet, students watch several video clips with social interactions selected by 
					the teacher. After discussing the key points, which they place on a checklist or rubric, 
					students record their role-plays using digital recorders or recording software, such 
					as Audacity (2010, http://audacity.sourceforge.net), on the class computer. Students 
					review their role-plays and analyze the success of the interaction using the rubric. 
					Students edit and rerecord as needed.

				<p>
					With access to video or audio recorders and limited access to the Internet, students 
					search for examples of introductions and other social interactions in movie trailers, 
					for instance using the Internet Movie Database (IMDb.com, 2010, http://www.imdb
					.com) and video sites such as Real English (Marzio School, 2010, http://www.real
					-english.com). Students work in small groups to analyze their samples; they are 
					then assigned a new topic or setting by the teacher, record their own role-plays, and 
					analyze them, comparing them to their original samples. They upload their role-plays 
					to a class blog or podcast, where their classmates can watch and make comments.

				<p>
					After initiating the topic of social conventions and discussing situations that occur in 
					one or two movie or video excerpts as in the settings previously described, students 
					use Internet and video chat with native speakers in the target culture. Students are 
					assigned to regularly access a free, social, tandem language learning site (e.g., Tandem 
					Server Bochum [BrammertsRuhr-Universität Bochum, 2005], http://www.slf.ruhr-uni
					-bochum.de/index.html, or Palabea [Palabea, 2009], http://www.palabea.net/). The 
					teacher assigns them specific topics to discuss with their native-speaking interlocutors. 
					Students are asked to request permission from interlocutors to record their 
					sessions with a desktop recording device, such as Audacity (Audacity Development 
					Team, 2010, http://audacity.sourceforge.net), so they can archive and review their 
					interactions.
				</p>

				<p>
					In preparation for speaking to native interlocutors, students find online samples, 
					record their own samples, and upload them as already described. They engage in 
					video chat role-plays with native speakers (individuals playing different roles or 
					as part of a tandem learning setting), using the topics suggested by their teacher. 
					Students analyze their interactions, taking notes if they are unable to record 
					the discussion. Once they have collected adequate information, they prepare a 
					presentation for the rest of the class. Their native speaker partner can also be virtually 
					present, if possible, using Internet telephony such as Skype (Skype Technologies, 
					2010; http://www.skype.com), to answer potential questions raised by the rest of 
					the class.

					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					An EFL teacher feels students would benefit from exposure to the ideas and customs 
					of other countries, but teaching in the native culture/country of the students has 
					required the teacher to look to technology to provide access to the cultural customs 
					of different regions that are not available to students locally. This module begins with 
					the class away from technology. The teacher begins class by asking if it is acceptable 
					to put your feet on the table. The teacher then introduces the use of infinitives to 
					discuss cultural norms (e.g., “It’s rude to put your feet on the table”), and the class 
					brainstorms cultural norms of their own country. The students also look at the 
					nuances of modals for making suggestions (e.g., should/shouldn’t, could/couldn’t),
					practicing with each other in role-play pairs. Students then seek out cultural norms 
					from other countries or regions as assigned by their teacher, using information 
					gathered, for example, from Wikipedia’s (2010b) site on cultural faux pas (http://
					en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faux_pas). 
				</p>

				<p>
					Using the think-pair-share strategy, students report back and discuss in groups the 
					differences or similarities between their culture and the other cultures assigned by 
					their teacher. In this activity students first brainstorm ideas alone (think), then they 
					are asked to share these ideas with a partner (pair), and finally the pair presents 
					some ideas to the group (share). Next the groups script out a scenario of a foreign 
					exchange student from their assigned culture coming to their school. The scenario 
					consists of an orientation for the new student regarding what the local community 
					considers public and private information (including visual information) as contrasted 
					with cultural norms in the student’s home country. Students perform their role-plays 
					while recording them for later analysis. The teacher reminds them to incorporate 
					the grammatical forms they have been studying. Eventually each individual student 
					will perform a short, more formal speech summarizing what has been learned about 
					different cultural customs. Classmates will evaluate each other’s performances, 
					including accuracy of speech. (For more on think-pair-share, see Ledlow, 2001.)

					In a one-computer classroom with no Internet access, the teacher prints out several

					(With Internet access at home or in a public place, students take turns and work in 
					small groups to find information on Wikipedia, skimming the articles their teacher 
					has suggested.) Students take notes, and if a printer is available, they print appropriate 
					parts of the Wikipedia article to share with the class. Students use the Wikipedia 
					information in their think-pair-share exercises, role-plays, and speeches (but students 
					are not allowed to read from the notes or printouts during these activities). The 
					oral performances are recorded for later analysis, using recording software such as

				<p>
					In a classroom with several computers, a projector, and Internet access, after students

					differences,” “cultural faux pas,” and the like. The teacher bookmarks these at each 
					computer station (e.g., by emailing the addresses to herself first). After viewing the 
					videos in small groups while taking notes, the students do a think-pair-share exercise 
					on the cross-cultural mistakes that were made. The students then script out a scenario

					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					The Intensive English Program (IEP) offers an elective in which students practice 
					integrated skills by interviewing each other and creating short biographies as part of 
					a class project. They are expected to ask each other about their families, share photos, 
					and create a short biography that describes significant moments in their partner’s 
					life. The elective course includes 19 students from 12 different countries, including 
					countries in Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia, and a wide range of ages. The 
					resulting class biography compilation is very popular and is shared widely around the 
					IEP and in the community as a whole.
				</p>

				<p>
					The teacher brings in photos, short readings, and video clips that can help start 
					discussion about culturally sensitive topics (e.g., people in swimsuits at the beach 
					or a child in the bathtub). The teacher then leads a discussion with students about 
					what might be appropriate for display on the web. As a result of the discussion, 
					the students set ground rules, guided by the teacher, about what kinds of graphics 
					they will use in their biographies and the topics they will address. They realize that 
					standards of modesty and privacy vary a great deal in the class. Since families will 
					also see the biographies, students are careful to double-check with each other before 
					including photos, text, or other information that might be embarrassing. They agree 
					not to send any part of a biography outside of the classroom until after the class as a 
					whole reviews the final project and agrees that it is ready for distribution. (See also 
					Wikipedia’s (2010b) site on cultural faux pas, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faux_pas, 
					which may be used to clarify cultural guidelines.) 
				</p>

				<p>
					For their project, students interview each other in order to create a short biography 
					with photos. They work in groups of three; each student takes a turn as interviewer, 
					interviewee, and note-taker. Students may want to record the interviews, using 
					audio or video recorders, for ease in creating the written text. After interviewing 
					each other to get ideas about significant moments in their lives, the student groups 
					decide together how to structure the biographical material. They use free timeline 
					software such as TimeGlider (Mnemograph, 2010; http://timeglider.com/) or Timelinr 
					(Sundar, n.d.; http://veerasundar.com/timelinr) to help them organize their project 
					and focus on the most significant events in the biographies; the teacher downloads

					and prints timelines where the Internet is not available to students. Once all the raw 
					material is collected, the students work together to interview each other and create 
					peer biographies. Students are encouraged to be creative in their use of illustrations 
					and cover art for the biographies, using free graphics editing software, either on 
					the computer or online. The digitized photos and draft biographies are stored on 
					a private class computer or school website with access only for class members as 
					they undergo review and revision. Students are very careful not to post any personal 
					information about others on their own public social networking sites. Any student 
					can request that a photo be removed from the private site and not included in the 
					public compilation.
				</p>

				<p>
					All class members are expected to view others’ biographies in near-final form and 
					offer comments and suggestions about the information included, coherence of 
					the project, and any privacy issues, following a checklist they have created with the 
					teacher’s help. Students also discuss appropriate ways to make comments about 
					others’ creative work. Once the final versions have been approved by each group and 
					the teacher, they are put onto a CD or DVD and uploaded to the public IEP site for 
					distribution. Students agree not to post any information other than their own on any 
					other public site such as Facebook (2010, http://www.facebook.com). (For more on 
					writing tasks, see Hedge, 2005.)

				<p>
					With one computer in class, students proceed as described in the Background section. 
					They use digital cameras or cell phones with photo capability in class or outside of 
					class to take pictures, and the teacher will scan any photos not in digital form. If there 
					is no private server to protect student information, sharing the information online 
					may not be appropriate. The teacher prints out a timeline template for students to 
					use on paper. Students may use Gimp (Gimp Team, 2010; free download at http://
					www.gimp.org), which the teacher can load on the class computer using a portable 
					memory device. The teacher creates files on the computer for each student team’s 
					project where students can load their photos, work on drafts, and create their 
					biographies, which can be printed out to take home.

					Students have access to computers at the IEP once a week. Internet access is readily

					and check out digital cameras. The teacher prints out timeline templates for student 
					groups to use on paper. Students work in pairs, taking turns interviewing and 
					responding to questions. They use the scanner to scan the photos from home that 
					are not in digital format and edit photos as needed using online tools such as Picasa 
					(Google, 2010h; http://picasaweb.google.com) or Photoshop Express (Adobe, 2010; 
					http://www.photoshop.com). They assemble all their materials into their written 
					biography. Drafts are posted on the class website or wiki for review.

					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					In an elementary ESL context, young learners are working on improving their reading 
					competence by creating and illustrating a story about families. The students have 
					learned basic vocabulary by looking at images of family groups representative of 
					U.S. families and of families from the students’ backgrounds (Mexico, Ukraine, 
					and Somalia) from photos that students have brought to class and from images the 
					teacher has downloaded from the Internet. Depending on the classroom level of 
					access to technology, students themselves use technology-based productivity tools 
					(e.g., Microsoft’s PowerPoint or a free slide maker such as Openoffice.org’s Impress 
					(Openoffice.org, 2010, http://www.openoffice.org) in various ways to aid both their 
					comprehension and their language production as they create an illustrated story 
					about a family. Students from different countries will negotiate meaning and what 
					they feel is important to use in the story.
				</p>

				<p>
					Away from the computer and with the whole class, the teacher first models an 
					example story using photos that the learners have brought to class, then models 
					the sentences they might use, e.g., “This is Tanya” and “She is the [daughter].” 
					(The students finish the sentences orally.) The teacher then uses the computer to 
					demonstrate how to open and use a word-processing file created with key words and 
					phrases related to the lesson on families. Students work in small groups to create 
					sentences for their stories and come to the computer to dictate them to the teacher, 
					who types them with the word processor, adding them to the file with key words. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Subsequently, the teacher demonstrates how to copy and paste these phrases into 
					a slideshow presentation (one sentence per slide) to create sentences like those 
					modeled earlier on the projector. The students help the teacher decide which 
					illustrations to add to each slide by dragging and dropping (or using the >Insert 
					function) from a collection of images from clip art or from the Internet that the 
					teacher has prepared and saved into a folder on the computer. Several students 
					are asked to come forward to use the keyboard and mouse until all students seem 
					confident in what is expected of them in the creation of a presentation and use of 
					the interface.
				</p>

				<p>
					The teacher then puts students into cross-cultural groups of three to create their 
					own presentations. One student is the writer, one student is the decider, and a third

					student is the checker. Students help each other compose descriptive sentences or a 
					short narrative about the family grouping they choose to illustrate using the words 
					and phrases they have just reviewed. They select illustrations to add to the story, 
					and they dictate sentences to each other to type (hunt-and-peck) into the program. 
					Students then use the presentation program and word processor to create and save 
					their presentation, assisted by the teacher or by more technology-savvy students. 
					Each group ends with a story of at least four pictures and at least four sentences. 
					The groups practice reading the final story that they have created, and then present 
					it to the class, each student reading a slide in turn. In a large class, groups pair up to 
					share their stories with their partner group. The teacher later prints the stories and 
					gives them to the student groups so that they can share their illustrated stories with 
					one another to practice reading. (For more about writing stories with children, see 
					Wright, 2003.)

				<h5>
					Low-resource, low-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With one computer in the classroom and a data projector or whiteboard, but no 
					Internet, the teacher models the illustrated story, first with a photo and then with 
					the productivity tools discussed in the previous section. The students work on their 
					demonstrations in triads, and they take turns going to the computer to select an 
					illustration from the teacher’s folder and work on their sentences. Meanwhile, the rest 
					of the class is assigned other activities. If students are already somewhat familiar with 
					keyboarding, the teacher lets them type and copy and paste (or drag and drop) words 
					and images with supervision.
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With a computer and Internet access for every three students, students first watch 
					the teacher’s demonstration and then work in groups of three at the computer, 
					as described, to create their presentations. The teacher circulates among the 
					workstations, helping students find the right phrases and use the keyboard. The 
					students present their stories to the class, and the teacher prints the stories for further 
					practice as in the Background section.
				</p>

				<h5>
					High-resource, high-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With a networked set of laptops, one per learner, and a projector for the teacher, the 
					teacher demonstrations proceed as previously described, with students watching 
					away from the computers. The teacher then sends the demonstration to the students’ 
					monitors for them to use as a model while they work on their own presentations 
					in triads sharing one computer. The students choose and download one or more 
					additional images from the teacher’s folder on the school’s file server to include in 
					their slideshow and add the URL on the final slide. Each pair’s final illustrated story 
					is, in turn, presented to the whole class orally using the lab’s data projector.

					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					Adult learners often have access to technology in labs and school libraries, or at work 
					sites or in their own classrooms. A higher level of technology allows them to access 
					software or online sites developed specifically to meet their need for further skill 
					practice and greater English proficiency. Adult learners with this kind of technology 
					access can utilize interactive language games and exercises more purposefully for 
					out-of-class use with a teacher’s guidance. For example, with the help of the teacher, 
					adult students can create learning objectives and use interactive software or Internet 
					sites that allow them to expand on their textbook and classroom activities, to practice 
					specific language skills, and to develop grammar and vocabulary related to their work 
					experience. They use these learning tools independently and seek other exercises, 
					games, and activities that help them continue language development after their 
					graduation from basic classes. 
				</p>

				<p>
					A series of activities can illustrate how adult learners can use a teacher’s help to 
					maximize their use of technology. First, students can be assisted by the teacher in 
					formulating specific personal objectives (e.g., not just “I want to learn English,” 
					but rather “I will use three new words this week” or “I will write down what I think 
					someone said and ask about it in class”). Students then access the lessons, exercises, 
					or learning games suggested by their teacher. To ensure they have a successful learning 
					experience, the teacher assists students in using the CD/DVD folder or in getting 
					online, registering and using a password, and finding appropriate exercises and 
					games, either with in-class demonstrations with a data projector or whiteboard, or for 
					a wholly online class, with a videoconferencing tool. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Students are asked to use the exercises or games independently (or in pairs or triads, 
					if they use a lab during class times) about 30 minutes per day, viewing the videos or 
					other prompts several times, reading with the script and performing the exercises, e.g., 
					writing a short essay. Students speak out loud with the dialogues even if they don’t 
					have a microphone to record and compare. Students keep a learning journal with 
					new expressions and bring questions to class or post them to the class discussion 
					forum. At frequent intervals throughout the term, the teacher leads a whole-class 
					discussion on what students are finding in the exercises and any problems that may

					have arisen. The teacher uses a visual checklist to help students express their problems 
					nonverbally if needed. Students are encouraged to evaluate their lessons, games, and 
					tools and choose those that give them the right kinds of practice for their needs. The 
					teacher develops short tests and quizzes (either paper or online) to supplement the 
					programs and to ensure that learners access them at regular, frequent intervals. The 
					teacher also confers with students individually (either face-to-face or, in a distance 
					class, online) to see if they need further help in meeting their objectives. For more 
					on using comprehensive video programs, see the U.S.A. Learns Webcast at http://
					www.usalearns.org/teacher/webcast.html; requires free teacher registration, or 
					available through the Outreach and Technical Assistance Network (OTAN, 2010b).

				<p>
					With access to classroom computers or a lab, students in pairs or triads use the CDs/
					DVDs that accompany their textbooks. The teacher helps students select the exercises 
					that will benefit their learning goals and assists them with the activities described in 
					the Background section. The teacher also creates a paper self-report checklist and a 
					quiz for each unit or set of exercises that students complete. If students have access 
					to the Internet outside of class, the teacher also recommends that they use one of the 
					many free Internet sites for further exercises, such as Randall’s Cyber ESL Listening 
					Lab (Davis, 2010, http://www.esl-lab.com/) or Real English (Marzio School, 2010, 
					http://www.real-english.com; with many job-related videos), or games and podcasts 
					at Interesting Things for ESL Students (C. Kelly and L. Kelly, 1997-2010; http://www

				<p>
					With headsets and stable bandwidth in the school lab or classroom, or with easy

					www.usalearns.org; for low-level students) or English for All (OTAN, 2003; http://
					www.myefa.org/; for higher-level beginners), both of which have vocabulary and 
					integrated skills activities focused on work and job-related scenarios. Students use 
					the program individually or in pairs to complete exercises. The teacher downloads 
					and prints free supplemental text materials, or the school may purchase the videos 
					on CD and print materials from the Outreach and Technical Assistance Network 
					(OTAN, 2003, 2010a) in order to use them at free-standing workstations, as well as 
					individually. The teacher monitors student activities using a paper self-report checklist 
					and quiz for each unit, or uses the program’s management system to see which 
					activities students are completing and how often they access the program. Students 
					may also access the programs as independent learners. Students access language 
					games at Interesting Things for ESL Students (C. Kelly and L. Kelly, 1997–2010; http://
					www.manythings.org/) suggested by their teacher to provide further practice and 
					motivation in learning vocabulary and grammar items.

					(See the ANVILL Webinar at https://anvill.uoregon.edu/anvill2/node/4255 for full 
					information.) The teacher creates a course designed specifically for the class. Lessons 
					are centered around the practice of oral/aural language but incorporate voiceboards 
					(both audio- and video-capable), live chat, oral quizzes, and so on. Students use 
					the tools to chat with each other, and the teacher encourages them to analyze body 
					language and gestures as well as oral pronunciation as they work. The teacher records 
					(or finds) and places audio- and video-based lessons at the class site (e.g., linked from 
					the discussion board) using the online resource to expand on classroom materials. 
					Students respond interactively with voice or writing to readings and activities, for 
					example, embedded videos from elsewhere on the web, and they build their own 
					audiovisual projects using the simple recording tool. The teacher can also insert audio 
					corrections into students’ speech recordings. The teacher creates voice chat rooms to

				<h6>
					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					In a primary EFL classroom, the teacher guides students in using appropriate 
					dictionaries so that students can improve their own vocabulary and develop learning 
					strategies that can help them independently improve their learning over time. If the 
					class is large, the teacher will have aides or parents assist in the classroom or lab. 
					The teacher sometimes uses one or two students who are very good in technology as 
					classroom helpers.
				</p>

				<p>
					Students are asked to decide in pairs or groups what they think the key vocabulary 
					items were in the unit they have just covered, relating to the theme of “home.” The 
					teacher brings to class a poster-size picture of, for example, a room in a house or a 
					cutaway house as a visual aid, or displays the poster on the class computer projector. 
					Once the key vocabulary items are identified, the students are encouraged to include 
					them in their personal picture dictionaries. The children write each vocabulary 
					item in their personal word-processing file and include a picture that illustrates 
					the meaning of the word, copying or dragging and dropping from clip art files on 
					the desktop, or from a folder of images created by the teacher. Depending on their 
					language level, students also add a sentence or phrase that includes the new item 
					or word.
				</p>

				<p>
					Next, students are asked to point to pictures of other objects in the poster whose 
					names they would like to learn but that were not included in the unit they studied, 
					thus allowing for personalization of learning and development of learner autonomy. 
					These might be additional furniture items, for example, or objects similar to those 
					students have in their own rooms. The teacher or other students help identify the 
					names of these items in English, and the students then research them in digital 
					dictionaries, adding the items to their personal journals with illustrations and 
					short sentences. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Finally, students work in pairs or groups to prepare activities using the additional 
					vocabulary items they have learned, for example, a short dialogue or narrative, or 
					vocabulary games. Vocabulary activities can be used later by their classmates. (For 
					more on using dictionaries for vocabulary learning, see Gu, 2003.)

				<p>
					In the review of the lesson, the teacher asks the children to evaluate the print and 
					e-dictionaries they used. The students individually complete the rubric shown in 
					Table 3.1 and then join in a class discussion that concludes with a ranking of the 
					dictionaries used.

				<p>
					In a classroom with one computer but no Internet connection, after deciding on 
					the key vocabulary items for the unit or thematic area, the students work to include 
					these items in their personal picture dictionaries. They can either draw pictures or 
					find pictures to represent the vocabulary items from clip art collections on their class 
					computer or pictures from CD/DVD dictionaries.
				</p>

				<p>
					Later, when students choose the additional vocabulary they would like to learn within 
					the specific unit, they use personal or school print picture dictionaries or CD/DVD 
					dictionaries from the school library. Once they choose the words they would like 
					to learn, they write them in their personal picture dictionaries and illustrate them 
					with pictures as described in the Background section. The pairs or groups take turns 
					designing this section of their personal dictionaries using mind-mapping software—
					such as Kidspiration (Inspiration Software, 2008) or FreeMind (2010)—installed on 
					the class computer.
				</p>

				<p>
					Finally, the teacher uses the students’ vocabulary journals to create activities that can 
					help them practice the new vocabulary items. The teacher installs software on their 
					computer downloaded from the Internet to a portable memory device (e.g., XWord 
					Interactive Crossword Puzzles [Greaves, 2010], http://vlc.polyu.edu.hk/XWord/xword
					.htm) or creates games online and prints them (e.g., from PuzzleMaker [Discovery 
					Education, 2008], http://puzzlemaker.discoveryeducation.com/). Once the activities 
					are ready, they are photocopied and given to the whole class as homework or saved as 
					additional resource activities to be used by fast finishers. Some of the pairs or groups 
					may be technologically ready to use the class computer to prepare electronic versions 
					of their activities themselves.

					.com/) to write and illustrate the new vocabulary items they have selected, and they 
					return to Kidspiration or a similar program in order to create the pages for their

					makers, such as Quia (2010, http://www.quia.com/web, if the school has purchased 
					it) or free programs such as Puzzlemaker (Discovery Education, 2008, http://
					puzzlemaker.discoveryeducation.com/) or Tools for Educators (2010, http://www
					.toolsforeducators.com/) to design simple activities, games, or puzzles with which to 
					practice their selected vocabulary items. They use instruction sheets with clear step-by-step
					directions illustrated with a number of screenshots, which they can refer to 
					if they need help. The class has aides they can address for help as well as the teacher. 
					The students may complete their evaluation rubrics online, but they bring their results

					In a classroom where the students have their personal laptops connected to the 
					Internet, the children away from the computers discuss the key vocabulary items 
					of the unit as described. The children then add the key items in their personal 
					e-dictionaries and use clip art, drawings, online resources recommended by their 
					teacher, or illustrations saved for them in a folder to illustrate the meanings of 
					the words.
				</p>

				<p>
					The students then use a range of online dictionaries to further investigate the specific 
					thematic area (e.g., “home”) and choose new words they would like to learn. They 
					add the words to their personal e-dictionaries, writing and illustrating them as 
					described. Finally, they work with easy interactive exercise or puzzle makers (e.g., 
					Puzzlemaker, Quia, or Tools for Educators) to design simple activities or worksheets 
					with which to practice their selected vocabulary items as described. 
				</p>

				<p>
					The teacher then uploads the activities the students have prepared to the class 
					section of the school website so that the rest of the class can access them. The 
					children are asked to complete some of their classmates’ activities as homework. 
					Finally, the children are asked to choose some of their work (either e-dictionary 
					pages or vocabulary activities) and upload it to their online portfolios. The students 
					complete their evaluation rubric online and bring a printout of it to class for the final 
					discussion and evaluations.

					Background

				<p>
					Adult learners need to become aware of various resources within their community, 
					such as information and services from city hall, the local library, or the employment 
					office. The teacher organizes learners in groups and assigns each group a task based 
					on a community resource, for example, calling their phone line to get information. 
					Students practice dialogues before making an appointment to connect with a service 
					representative. The teacher helps them use appropriate greetings, body language, 
					and eye contact. They also practice phrases to ask for clarification of information 
					and to respond when their respondent doesn’t understand them. Students make 
					note of what phrases they will need to know and pool their knowledge, with the 
					teacher’s help, about politeness formulas. The teacher uses these questions to form 
					the basis for grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation exercises. Where the Internet 
					is available, the students also do research online, visiting the community resource’s 
					website to gather more information about the service provided. Eventually, students 
					visit the community resource location to gather brochures and pamphlets and to get 
					information in person. They then create presentations in their groups and share with 
					the whole class what they have learned about the services offered. The class discusses 
					the best ways to obtain community information. (For more on using community 
					resources, see Jewell, 2006.)

				<p>
					Students in an intermediate EFL class are encouraged to consider how technology 
					can be used to assist the needs of language learners like themselves and provide 
					opportunities to use English outside their textbooks. The students are encouraged to 
					use English to navigate new technology via menus and instructions, and to practice 
					writing, thinking, and speaking skills while they take learning a step further toward 
					technology incorporation in their studies. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Students first examine advertisements (either in paper or on the web) for various 
					types of technologies (such as digital cameras, MP3 players, presentation software) 
					to analyze the language and visual presentation of ads and commercials. They 
					then use this analysis as the basis for creating their own presentation or sales pitch, 
					describing the merits of a particular technology for collaborative language learning. 
					Students use graphics programs, audio technology, and, in a high-access setting, 
					video, to create their commercials. The class debates the relative merits of the various 
					technologies to create collaborations, and they discuss technical, creative, and oral 
					skills aspects of their project, creating a checklist or rubric as they proceed. Once the 
					projects are completed, students present their work at an in-class exposition or awards 
					competition which is judged using their checklists. Students also mount their work 
					at online sites and invite other classes to view the presentations. (For more on using 
					podcasting and video projects, see Yeh, 2007.)

				<p>
					In a computer room with five computers, microphones, and speakers for each, and 
					Internet access outside of class, students work in groups with a choice of technology 
					(or are sent to websites with illustrations of the technologies) and are assigned the 
					task of creating a radio sales pitch for their product that emphasizes its function as 
					an aid in collaborative communication. After submitting a script to the teacher to 
					check for language and appropriateness, the students record their radio commercials, 
					either at a podcast site such as PodOmatic (2010, http://www.podomatic.com), if the 
					Internet is available, or on their local computers. Upon completion of the project, 
					the class listens to the commercials and hosts an awards ceremony with awards such 
					as best pronunciation, best grammar, best voice actor/actress, and so on, using their

					In a computer lab with a computer for each student, Internet, and a computer 
					projector, plus video or digital cameras available, students watch a variety of video 
					commercials at YouTube (YouTube, 2011, http://www.youtube.com), for example, or 
					at product websites and discuss in small groups their opinions of the ads. Each group 
					is then given a piece of technology (or is sent to websites with illustrations of the 
					technologies) and assigned the task of brainstorming ideas on how it could be used 
					to assist collaboration among language learners. Following this activity, the students 
					are asked to create a commercial of their own, pitching the ideas brainstormed using 
					digital cameras, mobile phone video, or webcams, as available, to create video/
					audio products. Upon completion of the project, one class is devoted to “Oscar 
					night,” when students view the commercials with the computer projector and vote 
					on awards, using their checklists, in categories such as grammaticality, best actor/
					actress, most creative use of assigned technology, and overall best commercial. If the 
					commercials are mounted at a blog or video site like Vimeo (2010, http://vimeo

				<p>
					Students in an online English for Architecture class are learning to use the Internet 
					for research and to evaluate and present information as if they were working on 
					an architectural team in a prospective place of employment in their field. Their 
					assignment helps them practice English while learning about a period of architectural 
					style. They find images from a particular architectural style, either on the web or 
					by taking pictures of specific buildings with their own cameras or mobile phones, 
					and assemble a presentation to be given in English wholly online for peers and 
					invited guests. Planning and execution of the presentation mimic the kinds of team 
					effort and language skills students will be required to use in their projected future 
					employment. Students work in groups of three to five to prepare a research plan in 
					English, which is checked at frequent intervals by the ESP instructor, who helps with 
					English vocabulary and structure as well as checking on progress. Team members 
					choose various roles with differing responsibilities, such as text editor, image editor, 
					assembly editor. (Roles will change in various team configurations throughout the 
					course; if students are widely dispersed globally, the teacher may need to create 
					groups that are geographically compact.)
				</p>

				<p>
					The students’ instructor helps them find image resources and related professional 
					reference material. Students consult an online dictionary of technical terms, such 
					as Archiseek (Clerkin, 2010, http://www.archiseek.com/), to ensure they are using 
					appropriate vocabulary. Students are given examples of correct ways to cite online 
					resources in their field, and they document all their materials. Individual students 
					use blogs to describe their work processes and any difficulties they may encounter as 
					they work in a team, so that the teacher can monitor their interactions and assist in 
					vocabulary and other English skill development as needed. A practice presentation 
					at an online venue (e.g., Wiziq [AuthorGEN, 2010], http://www.wiziq.com) gives the 
					teacher the opportunity to correct students’ oral language efforts without the pressure 
					of the final performance. (If students and audience are widely dispersed, they may 
					need to present several times in order to include everyone.)
				</p>

					While watching the practice presentations, students take notes critiquing each 
					other’s oral performance, which they share in their online forum. Following the

					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					Students in a college IEP setting come from various countries, but this is their 
					first experience in the United States. They have some competencies in analyzing 
					the credibility of a text, but these vary, depending on their prior learning. During 
					class discussion, students are given a short time to critically analyze print items 
					representing a spectrum of reliability, such as The Washington Postand The National 
					Enquirer. They discuss which is a good news source and which is not, and start a 
					checklist of criteria. Students in groups are then given copies of the New York Post, 
					USA Today, andThe New York Timesand continue to work on their criteria. Then the 
					class comes together and discusses the criteria and what makes a good resource. (For 
					more on search strategies, see Google for Educators: Google Web Search [Google, 
					2010d], http://www.google.com/educators/p_websearch.html.)
				</p>

				<p>
					In a subsequent session, students compare printouts of several web pages, some from 
					sources similar to those above and some from less reliable sources, such as extremist 
					groups or groups with vested commercial interests. Using the criteria they have 
					created, students decide in groups whether particular sites are reliable or not. The 
					class then comes together and discusses what is important about evaluating websites, 
					as compared to print resources. Discussion includes points such as what the domain 
					names mean (.org, .edu, .gov, .com, and others), who owns a site (private individual, 
					research institute, school district, etc.), whether hyperlinks are active, time stamps of 
					last updates to the website, the amount of advertisement on a given site, whether the 
					site is copyrighted, and whether a contact can easily be found. Students learn how 
					to find out who owns a site (e.g., at easyDNS, 2010,, http://www.easywhois.com) 
					and look at previous versions of the site at the Internet Archive: WayBackMachine 
					(Internet Archive, 2010; http://www.archive.org). Printouts or screenshots of results 
					from these sites are shared with the class. Students also look at what sites are linked 
					to and from the site they are evaluating, and discuss what this implies about the site’s 
					reliability. In groups, students continue to develop their checklists to include website 
					evaluation comparable to their ideas for evaluating texts. Then they use the new 
					criteria to examine websites within the framework of the technology access they have. 
					Students make their own paper copies of the reliability criteria the class devises, and 
					keep their copies with them as they access the Internet when they are doing research. 
					The teacher gives them a handout with appropriate referencing formats, which they 
					discuss during the course of their research so that sources will be accurately cited.

					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					The teacher is aware of the importance of vocabulary development in a sheltered 
					Science Concepts class and wants to empower students to use technology for 
					knowledge and self-efficacy. The teacher also knows that technology is motivating for 
					adolescent students. The students have access to CD/DVD dictionaries in the school 
					lab and library, but the teacher also introduces open-source software and websites 
					because students can access them freely from home or community computers. 
					Open-source online Wiktionary (Wikimedia, 2010; www.wiktionary.org) is useful 
					to preview a lesson and to allow students to learn vocabulary in a comprehensive 
					way. By becoming aware of the information offered by Wiktionary as well as its ease 
					of access, students become more self-sufficient in accelerating their own vocabulary 
					development and become aware of a lifelong learning tool.
				</p>

				<p>
					In addition, the teacher attempts to encourage a community of learners, in which 
					students and teachers share information and skills. As students read their science text, 
					they make notes about the words they are not sure of or would like to know more 
					about. In class, students work in pairs, looking up the words they are both unsure 
					of and cross-checking those they agree on. Classmates take notes and ask questions 
					when each pair reports back to the class. Students keep their notes and a record of the 
					new words, e.g., in a vocabulary journal, and are expected to use the new vocabulary 
					in subsequent writing assignments and oral discussions/presentations. If students 
					are unable to find a particular word or phrase in Wiktionary, they write a description 
					of it, using the required format, to submit for publication. Students are encouraged 
					to explore linked references from the Wiktionary pages as well. Eventually, students 
					use their vocabulary journal to help write a paper on an assigned subject or to 
					work on a collaborative project with their peers. (For more on vocabulary journals 
					and notebooks, see Board of Education, San Diego County, 2007; and Feldman & 
					Kinsella, 2005.)

				<h5>
					Low-resource, low-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With Internet access outside the classroom, the teacher prints and copies key 
					vocabulary from Wiktionary for an upcoming lesson. The teacher models analysis of 
					the information from Wiktionary by presenting a few examples and demonstrates 
					on an overhead projector (or chalkboard) the pronunciation using IPA, the part 
					of speech, and the number of different meanings. The teacher asks students which 
					meaning may be relevant to the upcoming lesson. Pairs of students then use a 
					printout of one key word in a matrix and prepare a presentation of each aspect: the 
					pronunciation in IPA, the part of speech, the number of different meanings, and 
					which meaning is relevant to the upcoming lesson. Before each pair of students 
					presents its key word to the class, the partners practice their presentation with teacher 
					assistance—especially the pronunciation of the word, which each student should 
					master. (If Internet access is available at home or in the school lab, students may also 
					use an online talking dictionary, such as HowJSay.com, Boyer, 2010, http://www
					.howjsay.com/, for pronunciation help.)
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					With one computer in the classroom, Internet access, and, if possible, a computer 
					projector or electronic whiteboard, the teacher models the uses of Wiktionary 
					by demonstrating how to look up key vocabulary, discussing the importance of 
					precise spelling, showing the multilingual translations and the academic definition, 
					and, if possible, clicking on the pronunciation. Each feature, such as spelling and 
					translations, is documented on the board for reference. Students in pairs take turns 
					at the computer and look up key vocabulary while discussing each feature listed 
					on the board. They present their findings to the class and save their notes for their 
					vocabulary journals. 
				</p>

				<h5>
					High-resource, high-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					In a networked computer lab, with one computer and a headset for each student, 
					the teacher models the uses of Wiktionary before students go to the computers. The 
					teacher posts a list of key vocabulary from the students’ textbook on the wall or 
					board or hands out copies. The teacher then shows how to access and use Wiktionary 
					in a step-by-step process. At each step, the teacher involves students’ awareness and 
					engages them. The procedure is modeled, discussed, and documented on the board 
					for reference. The teacher discusses the information on the site, focusing on two 
					aspects: the audio file and translations. At the computers with headsets, students click 
					on the audio file and practice pronunciation. Students in pairs are assigned one or 
					more words and subsequently collaborate to present their words to the class.

					Background
				</h6>

				<p>
					An advanced IEP class is coming to a close, and the teacher wants the students (a) to 
					recognize the range of English that is used around the world by native and nonnative 
					speakers and (b) to recognize how technology can help them expand their own 
					understanding as well as contribute to others’ understanding of the variations of 
					English. The instructor has decided to use maps as a visual platform for students to 
					conceptualize the use of English worldwide and to contribute their own reflections 
					about language variation to a collaborative, publicly accessible forum. There are 15 
					students in the class representing six nationalities. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Working in groups, students are assigned a country and then locate places of interest 
					in their assigned country, which might include their or their parents’ hometowns. 
					They create maps with placemarks indicating places worth a visit in their assigned 
					country, using either a graphics program on the computer, or, where the Internet is 
					available, Google Earth (Google, 2010b, http://earth.google.com). Their placemarks 
					will include short descriptions in English and will demonstrate at least one example 
					of a phrase or sentence in a local variety of English. Students find these examples by 
					locating local online newspapers, stories, or blogs by local people written in English. 
					After creating their maps, students display them to their classmates, who help with 
					peer editing and ask questions that can be clarified in later revisions. The groups 
					then return to the computer for revision and editing. Once the maps and edited 
					placemarks are finalized, they are displayed again. 
				</p>

				<p>
					In a culminating discussion, students analyze the map project and what they have 
					learned about other countries (and their own), about their classmates, and about 
					English variation. They also discuss the strengths and limitations of the technology 
					they have used and how it can increase opportunities for communication with other 
					English speakers around the world. The electronic versions of the maps, both first 
					and second drafts, are included in each student’s personal e-portfolio. (For more on 
					educational uses of Google Earth, see Herring, 2008; and Google, 2010c.)

				<h5>
					Low-resource, low-access setting
				</h5>

				<p>
					In a classroom with one computer and no Internet access, using personal access to 
					the Internet, the teacher downloads map images of countries around the world on 
					a portable device and uploads them to the class computer for students to work on 
					in groups. After brainstorming the places they will describe, each group uses the 
					computer’s drawing program to mark four places on their map that would be of 
					interest to their classmates. If the teacher has access to a scanner, the students bring 
					in photos to add to their map. They write on the map graphic a brief description 
					in English of each place, using a print dictionary or an electronic dictionary on 
					the computer. The teacher brings in printouts from online sources and leads a 
					discussion on aspects of local Englishes. The teacher also prints out pictures students 
					have brought from home, using the school’s printer if one is not available in the 
					classroom. If audio sources are available (CDs or student recordings), they can also 
					be used, giving the students the chance to hear varieties of English. Next, the student 
					groups place their maps on the wall, and the class does a gallery walk in which 
					students write notes (on sticky notes) as the groups take turns presenting their map 
					and pictures. In order not to interrupt the presentations, the audience members later 
					tag other students’ maps with their questions, comments, or edits. The student groups 
					then revise their maps to address their classmates’ questions. The finalized maps are 
					placed on display around the room for the culminating class discussion.
				</p>

				<h5>
					Medium-resource, medium-access setting 
				</h5>

				<p>
					In a fully equipped computer lab that is only available twice a week, with reliable 
					Internet access, students in groups perform the brainstorming and begin writing 
					their descriptions on paper away from the computer. In the next class, held in 
					the computer lab, students do an online search for pictures, videos, or audio 
					samples to accompany their descriptive passages, or they record their own video 
					testimonials using audio software like Audacity (Audacity Development Team, 
					2010, http://audacity.sourceforge.com). In subsequent lessons, the instructor gives 
					a demonstration on making placemarks on Google Earth (Google, 2010b, http://
					earth.google.com) and then circulates around the room as students create their own 
					placemarks using the photos, videos, and audio files. The next lesson is held in a 
					standard classroom, and the class works on organizing speeches, with the task of 
					creating a speech that ties all their placemarks together. Meeting once again in the 
					computer lab, the students record their speeches into a Google Earth tour (using 
					free downloadable software). When the class meets in the lab again, the students 
					watch the tours. Students then hold their culminating discussion back in their 
					standard classroom.
				</p>

				<h5>
					High-resource, high-access setting 
				</h5>

				<p>
					In a fully equipped computer lab with Internet and computer projector, following 
					a teacher demonstration, students are asked to make a series of placemarks tags on 
					Google Earth for their assigned countries, including all aspects described in previous 
					sections. Students include photos, video or audio clips, and writing. Over the next

					week, as students collect their material, the teacher helps them piece it all together in 
					a Google Earth tour. For their final class, students watch each other’s tours and see, 
					via Google Earth, the reach of their potential English-language network, as they hold 
					their culminating discussion.
