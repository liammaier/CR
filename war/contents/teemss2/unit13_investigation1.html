				<h2>Thinking About The Question</h2>

				<p class="red"><span class="first-sentence">What keeps populations stable?</span></p>

				<p>A "population" is a collection of individual organisms that can interbreed, such as a single species of gray squirrels or
				a species of dandelion.</p>

				<p>In the natural world, such populations of animals and plants go up and down with changing environmental conditions.
				For example, the squirrel population changes from year to year depending on the availability of nuts, which in turn
				may depend on rainfall or temperatures.</p>

				<p>Over time, however, many populations are relatively stable. They don't grow forever, and they don't disappear. For
				instance, the squirrel population in an area might fluctuate from year to year between 1000 and 4000, but it would
				rarely be more or less than this.</p>

				<p>Take the example of deer in a forested part of the country. List at least three factors that you think could affect the size
				of the deer population from year to year. Explain your reasoning.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>If the area where the deer lived started to be developed with houses and roads, would it affect the deer population?
				What factors would cause the change?</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<p><span class="first-sentence">As you may have discovered while thinking about deer, there are a great number of factors that affect the size
						of a population.</span> We can often only guess what their influence really is. To explore how these systems work,
						you will use a simplified population model with only a few factors.</p>

						<p>Picture yourself as a rancher with a large field of sheep. You start with an equal number of males (horns) and
						females (no horns). They live for six years. The sheep move around the field and eat grass, which grows back
						at a certain rate. The patch is green if there is grass there, and brown if there is no grass. In the model, the
						sheep move and eat during the year. They use up energy as they move, and gain energy from eating grass. If
						their energy goes to zero, they die.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Once a year, from age 3 to age 6, each female gives birth to a baby. How many babies could a female produce
						in its lifetime?</p>
