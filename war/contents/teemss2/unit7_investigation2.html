				<h2>Thinking About The Question</h2>

				<p class="red">Can you combine several simple machines to make work easier by changing the size or direction of an applied
				force?</p>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">Look around your neighborhood and identify any kind of machinery that helps make work easier.</span> Besides levers,
				pulleys, and inclined planes, you may notice other simple machines. These gadgets (wedges, screws, and wheel and
				axles) are really just different forms of pulleys and inclined planes. A wedge is a modification of an inclined plane that
				moves. It is made of two inclined planes placed together. A screw is also really an inclined plane that curves around a
				shaft or pole. A wheel and axle is a modification of a pulley. A wheel is fixed to a shaft called an axle. The wheel and
				axle move together to be a simple machine.</p>

				<p>Some common everyday machines are shown above. Do any of these gadgets consist of more than one simple
				machine? This would qualify them to be listed as a compound (or complex) machine. If so, which ones? Be prepared
				to discuss your thoughts with the class.</p>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">With the Drawing Tool you can make and label drawings.</span> The tool palette for the Drawing Tool appears below,
					followed by a more detailed description of the features and function of each tool.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig1-3.png">
					</figure>

					<p>Freehand tool. The freehand tool lets you draw freehand. When you draw, a selection rectangle appears around your
					drawing. You can use this rectangle to move your freehand drawing, change its color or delete it. To learn more about
					changing an object's color, read the Color Tool description below. To learn more about deleting an object, read about
					the Delete button below.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig1-4.png">
					</figure>

					<p>Line tool. The line tool lets you draw lines. Click and drag to create a line. After the line is created, you can click on it
					to select it, move it, change its size, shape, color or delete it.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig1-5.png">
					</figure>

					<p>Rectangle tool. The rectangle tool lets you draw squares and rectangles. Click and drag to create a rectangle. After a
					rectangle is created, you can click on it to select it, move it, change its size, shape, color or delete it.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig1-6.png">

					<p>Oval tool. The oval tool lets you draw circles and ovals. Click and drag to create an oval. After an oval is created, you
					can click on it to select it, move it, change its size, shape, color or delete it.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">8</span></div>

					<figure>
						<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig1-7.png">
					</figure>

					<p>Text tool. The text tool lets you write text for descriptions or labels. Click to create a note. Once a note is created,
					click on the lower right hand corner of the note to see a menu that lets you edit, change color or delete a note. Once a
					note is created, you can always select it and move it around.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig1-8.png">
					</figure>

					<p>Color Palette. If any object is selected -- a freehand drawing, line, rectangle, etc. -- you can change its color using the
					color palette. Click on the tool to see a full palette of colors. Select the color of choice and click OK.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig1-9.png">

					then the true weight of the object is 15 - 2 = 13 N.</p>
