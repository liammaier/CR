				<h2>Thinking About The Question</h2>

				<p class="red"><span class="first-sentence">Do you have what it takes to be a scientist?</span></p>

				<p>One very important skill in science is the ability to design experiments and take measurements. You may have a
				theory about how something works, but for this idea to be called scientific, you must devise an experiment that
				supports your theory. Furthermore, until other people can repeat your experiment, the scientific community may not
				be confident about your findings.</p>

				<p>With your group, choose something to measure, using one of the sensors available to you. Discuss how you will do it.
				Here are some suggestions, but you can also invent your own.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Measure how long a ball is in the air between bounces, having been dropped from 2 meters (option: compare
					two balls of different bounciness).</li>

					<li>Measure how high you can jump (option: compare two people).</li>

					<li>Measure how long you can stay in the air, when you jump straight up (option: compare two people).</li>

					<li>Weigh something that's too heavy for the force sensor, without hurting the force sensor (example: a gallon of
					water).</li>

					<li>Weigh something that's too light for the force sensor (example: a paper clip).</li>

					<li>Find a way to record the period and height of a pendulum swing (option: compare different lengths of
					pendulum).</li>

					<li>Measure the humidity above water and how it is changed by the water temperature (Note: hurricanes form by
					the evaporation of water from warm tropical oceans).</li>

					<li>Make an earthquake detector that can detect someone hitting a table. How lightly can the table be hit and still
					be detected?</li>

					<li>Measure the cooling time of a cup of hot water and how it is affected by wind speed.</li>

					<li>Measure light intensity using a temperature sensor.</li>

					<li>Measure the cloudiness of a liquid sample.</li>

					<li>Measure the maximum falling speed (terminal velocity) of a coffee filter.</li>

					<li>Measure how fast a penny can be heated by rubbing.</li>

					<li>Measure the force needed to throw a tennis ball 3 meters.</li>

					<li>Measure the force needed to tear different kinds of paper.</li>

					<li>Measure the wet strength of different brands of paper towels.</li>

					<li>Measure the transparency of different materials (glass, plastic).</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Write down what you have chosen: one from the list or your own idea.</p>

					<li><span class="first-sentence">For each experiment, form a panel consisting of the original group and the repeating group.</span> The rest of the
					class has the responsibility of offering "peer review." This is the term used when fellow scientists look at their
					colleagues' work and decide if it meets the scientific community's standards for rigor and accuracy.</li>

					<li>
						<p>First, the original group presents its experiments and findings to the class, covering the following points:</p>

						<ol>
							<li>Describe your experimental setup.</li>

							<li>Describe your procedure.</li>

							<li>
								<p>Present your results.</p>

							</li>

							<li>Summarize your findings.</li>

					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Next, the repeating group reports on its efforts to reproduce the results.</p>

						<ol>
							<li>Did you measure what you intended to measure?</li>

							<li>Could you understand and follow the procedure?</li>

							<li>Did you get the same results? If not, how different were they and why?</li>
						</ol>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>The class can then question the presenters on their findings and experiences. Below is a list of questions
						scientists might ask:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Could you repeat the measurement and get the same result?</li>

							<li>If there is variation in the results, how do you explain that?</li>

							<li>How accurate are the results? Do you have a way to verify this? Can you describe another way to do
							the same measurement?</li>

							<li>How could the experiment be improved?</li>

							<li>What did you learn from the measurement process?</li>

							<li>How could you improve your written procedure?</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

						<p>After the presentations, answer the following questions about YOUR presentation below.
						Did you measure what you intended to measure?</p>
