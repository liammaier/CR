				<h2>Thinking About The Question</h2>

				<p class="red"><span class="first-sentence">How do you make a measurement you can trust?</span></p>

				<p>Measuring things is a central activity of scientists, because it helps them think about and understand the world. New
				theories often come about because something new can be measured, or because a measurement becomes more
				accurate. But measurement comes up everywhere, not just in science: medicine, sports, cooking, games, and building
				things.</p>

				<p>Engineers and manufacturers constantly rely on measurements to make products that are reliable and safe. If the
				measurements are not reliable, there can be a lot of trouble! In the case of testing the strength of concrete in a bridge,
				people's lives could be at risk.</p>

				<p>Think of an example where measurements are important for things you use every day, and explain the consequences if
				the measurements aren't correct. Be specific about the measurement that is needed. Be prepared to discuss your
				thoughts with the class.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>Think about what it means to "trust" a measurement. What evidence would make you confident that a measurement
				was a good one? Be prepared to discuss your thoughts with the class.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>Scientists make a distinction between the <span class="bold">precision</span> and the <span class="bold">accuracy</span> of a measurement. Precision has to do with the
				repeatability of the measurement and accuracy has to do with the closeness of the measurement to an accepted value.
				This is a difficult distinction to explain. Here is an example.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">2</span></div>

				<p>Suppose you are shooting at a target with a bow and arrow. You aim very carefully. The arrows always hit the target
				about four inches below the bull's-eye. Your aim is very precise, because you always hit the same spot. But it is not
				accurate, because you don't hit the bull's-eye. In science, your error would be called a <span class="bold">systematic</span> error, because it is
				always in the same direction.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig29-2.png">
				</figure>

				<p class="bold">systematic error, precise (clustered) but not accurate (not near the center)</p>

				<p>One day you are tired and rushed. Your arrows hit all over the target. Your aim is neither precise nor accurate. In
				science, your errors would be called random errors, because they are in many different directions. If you averaged
				the positions of all the arrows, you might be able to infer where the bull's-eye is, even if you didn't hit it reliably. The
				average of many measurements can sometimes produce an accurate result.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig29-3.png">
				</figure>

				<p class="bold">random errors, not precise (not clustered), individual points not accurate but the average of many points may
				be accurate.</p>

				<p>Finally, one day you figure out that you should always aim a little higher than the center, to allow for the arrow's drop
				along the way. Then your shot becomes both accurate and precise.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig29-4.png">
				</figure>

				<p class="bold">precise (clustered) and accurate (near the center)</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">3</span></div>

				<p>A real measurement can never be perfectly precise and accurate. For example, measure the width of a tabletop to the
				nearest centimeter. Does everyone in the class agree? What about to the nearest millimeter? To the nearest tenth of a
				millimeter?</p>

				<p>All measurements include a range of error that indicates how accurate the scientist thinks the measurement is. You
				should always include this range of error when you report measurements. For example, the generally accepted age of
				the earth is 4.4 to 4.6 billion years, or 4.5 billion years plus or minus 0.1.</p>

				<p>Pick a tabletop in the room and have individuals or students measure its width <span class="bold">independently</span>. Record all of the
				measurements on the board. What is the range of measurements? Record the class average and the range of error.</p>

					<li>
						<p><span class="first-sentence">Here is one more experiment to try before you invent your own measurement project (Investigation 2).</span> You
						will determine the density of an object and compare the results of different ways of doing it.</p>

						<p>"Density" is a measure of how much mass there is in a given volume of a material. For example, a cubic meter
						of steel is heavier than a cubic meter of wood, so steel is denser than wood. A liter of water is heavier than a
						liter of air, so water is denser than air. In general, gases are less dense than liquids.</p>

						<p>Density is measured as the ratio of mass to volume (called "mass per unit volume"). In this section, it is
						measured in grams per cubic centimeter or g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

						<p>A cubic centimeter of water has a mass of one gram. What is its density?</p>

						<div class="short-answer"></div>

						<p>10 cm<sup>3</sup> of aluminum have a mass of 26 g. What is the density of aluminum?</p>

					<li>
						<p>Water is a useful material to compare with other materials, because its density is 1 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Also, if a solid

							<li>Its volume is somewhere between a ping pong ball and a baseball.</li>

							<li>It is a size and shape that you can suspend in a bowl of water.</li>

							<li>It should weigh between 200 and 500 g (2 to 5 N).</li>

							<li>Its geometry is simple enough so that you can measure it and calculate its volume (i.e., spheres,

						</ol>

						<p>Describe the object you have chosen.</p>

						<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

						<p>To find the density of your object, you will first measure the weight of the object using a force sensor and

						will choose the best value for the volume and calculate the density as mass / volume.</p>
					</li>

					<li>First you need to measure the weight of your object hanging in air. Connect the force sensor. Refer to
					<strong>Technical Hint: Connecting the Vernier force sensor</strong> to connect the force sensor. Zero the force sensor. See

						<p>The graph may be irregular. Pick the value for the weight that you think is the most accurate. Note that the

						<div class="short-answer"></div>

						<p>Calculate the mass of the object in grams, using the fact that 98 g = 1 N.</p>

						<div class="short-answer"></div>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Second, you need to find the volume of your object. You will use three different methods, outlined below.
						Using different methods to measure the same thing is a common way for scientists to check the accuracy of a
						measurement.</p>

						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold">Method A:</span> Weigh the object when it is fully submerged in water. Objects in water experience a
							buoyant (upward) force depending on their volume. An object less dense than water will float; an
							object more dense than water will appear to weigh less. The difference between weight of the object
							in air and the object in water is equal to the weight of the displaced water. Since 0.01 N is equivalent
							to 1 g or 1 cm<sup>3</sup> of water, you can figure out the volume of water displaced by the object.</li>

							<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">14</span></div>

							<li><span class="bold">Method B:</span> Find a container that has a spout or lip. Fill so that it just overflows. Then lower the object
							into the container and collect the displaced water in a cup. Weigh the cup to find the weight of the
							water displaced, and hence its volume.</li>

							<li><span class="bold">Method C:</span> Measure the size of the object and use volume formulas to calculate its volume in cubic
							centimeters (cm<sup>3</sup>).</li>
						</ol>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p class="bold">Method A: Buoyancy</p>

						<p>Prepare a jar or bowl of water that is large enough to have your object fully immersed in water. Connect the
						force sensor. Refer to <strong>Technical Hint: Connecting the Vernier force sensor</strong> to connect the force sensor. Zero
						the force sensor. See <strong>Technical Hint: Zeroing the Force Sensor</strong> to zero the force sensor.</p>

						<p>Measure and record the weight of your object immersed in water. If the object floats, push it into the water
						with the force sensor and measure the force upward.</p>

						</figure>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Calculate the weight of the displaced water, which is equal to the <span class="bold">change</span> in downward force.</p>

						<p>If the object sinks, this is (weight in air minus weight in water).</p>

						<p>If the object floats, this is (weight in air plus buoyant force upward on the force sensor).</p>

						<p>The weight in air, which you measured earlier, is:</p>

						<p>You just measured the weight in water. Calculate the difference.</p>

						<p>Difference between weight in air and weight in water:</p>

						<div class="short-answer"></div>

						<p>Convert this weight in Newtons to mass in grams (1 N = 98 g).</p>

						<div class="short-answer"></div>

						<p>Convert this mass to cm^3 of water (1 g of water = 1 cm<sup>3</sup>), which is the volume of your object.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p class="bold">Method B: Displacement</p> 

						<p>Find a container that will drip into a cup when it overflows, and fill the container
						to the brim with water. Make a handle for the cup so that you can weigh it.</p>

						<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">16</span></div>

						<figure>
							<img class="center" src="/contents/teemss2/images/butterfly.png">

						<p>Slowly lower the object into the water and collect the displaced water. Weigh the cup with the water. Then
