				<p>Get together with your group members and generate a list of places where water is found (for example, in a lake,
				stream, clouds, etc.) Write your list below.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>In your list, what places have water in the form of a liquid, solid (ice or snow), or a vapor? Sort your list above into

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>Water moves around the earth in what is known as the water cycle. You've listed where the water is on earth. What do
				you know about how it moves around? Be prepared to share your understanding with the class.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>Most of the water on earth is contained in the world's oceans. In the Drawing Tool below, a giant puddle of water is
				shown, which represents all the water in the oceans. If all the snow and ice in the world melted into a puddle next to
				this one, how big would this other puddle be? Next to the graphic of the ocean water, use the Drawing Tool to draw
				what you think the size of this snow and ice puddle would be in relation to the ocean. Refer to <strong>Technical Hint: Using
				the drawing tool</strong> to use the Drawing Tool.</p>

				<figure>
					<img class="center" src="/contents/teemss2/images/butterfly.png">
				</figure>

				<p>Now check your prediction. A stamp has been added to the Drawing Tool that represents all other water on earth in
				the form of snow and ice. Use the stamp to display this amount of water. Refer to <strong>Technical Hint: Using the drawing
				tool</strong> to use the Drawing Tool.</p>

				<figure>
					<img class="center" src="/contents/teemss2/images/butterfly.png">

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">3</span></div>

				<p>Although snow and ice only account for 2% of all the water on earth, they store the majority of the earth's fresh water.
				How did the size of the stamp compare with your predicted size?</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>Now use the Drawing Tool to make four more puddles each representing all the water on earth contained in:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>lakes</li>

					<li>rivers</li>

					<li>the air or atmosphere</li>

					<li>biological material (plants, animals, and humans)</li>
