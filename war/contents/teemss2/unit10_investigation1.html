						<p>The Greenhouse Effect refers to how changes in the earth's atmosphere affect how much it is heated by the
						sun. The heating effect is greater if certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, are in the atmosphere. Burning oil
						and coal increases the carbon dioxide level. There is great concern that as we burn more oil and coal, the earth
						will heat up.</p>

						<p>Research the Greenhouse Effect on the Web. How is the process like or unlike a real greenhouse? In what
						ways could our environment change as a result of the Greenhouse Effect?</p>
