					<h3>Technical Hint - Learning how the motion sensor works</h3>

					<figure>
						<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig10-8.png">
					</figure>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Bats fly back and forth in a cave at night to find their food.</span> While flying at night, a bat emits squeaks that reflect off
					the walls of caves and flying insects. These squeaks return to the bat's nervous system and are used as clues to
					determine the location and shape of the objects. The bat can tell where the next meal is and when to avoid other
					objects.</p>

					<p>A motion sensor (also called an ultrasonic detector) uses technology for a similar purpose. A motion sensor uses a
					motion detector that sends out high frequency sound waves to a target object and waits for the sound wave to come
					back. The motion sensor measures the time needed for the wave to leave and return to the detector. What is so unique
					about a motion sensor is that software can determine and display the distance a wave covered based on the speed of
					sound in a graph.</p>

					<h3>Technical Hint - Zeroing the Force Sensor</h3>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">The force sensor may not read zero when there is no force on it.</span> The software for zeroing the force sensor is not ready
					yet. For now, when you take a force measurement, subtract the starting force from that measurement to obtain a true
					reading.</p>

					<p>For example, if you lift an object and the force sensor reads 15 N, and it reads 2 N before you have lifted anything,
					then the true weight of the object is 15 - 2 = 13 N.</p>
