				<p>Discovery Question: How can I describe and illustrate motion?</p>

				<p>Students use a motion sensor to track and make graphs of their own motion. They predict the graphs that go with
				given motions and motions that go with given graphs. They explore the relationship between position and speed.</p>

				<h2>Thinking About The Question</h2>

				<p class="red"><span class="first-sentence">How can I describe and illustrate motion?</span></p>

				<p>Some objects fall over when they are pushed or pulled while other objects move freely. Think about a tree blowing in
				the wind. The upper branches of the tree move with the wind. Once the wind stops, the tree sways back and forth until
				it comes to rest at its original position. This type of repeated motion occurs often in other situations. While you are
				playing with a yo-yo, the toy moves up and down and up and down. When a car is stuck in the snow or mud, the
				driver rocks the car forward and backward until it is freed. A tiger pacing in a zoo pen also shows repeated motion.
				Can you think of at least two more examples of repeated motion? Discuss this question with your group and write
				down some of your examples of repeated motion to share with the class.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>Observe the following graph made by a motion sensor. Refer to <strong>Technical Hint: Learning how the motion sensor
				works</strong> to learn how a motion sensor works.</p>

				<p>How can you tell from the graph that the motion is repeated?</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>How long does it take to repeat the motion? Write your answer below, in seconds.</p>

				<div class="short-answer"></div>

				<p>Think about the motion of a Slinky when you release one end and allow it to drop to the ground. The loose end of the
				Slinky drops and then bounces back. In fact, the Slinky will continue to move up and down in a repeated pattern for
				some time. Describe another object's motion that might produce a wave-like repeated pattern of motion.</p>

						<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig10-8.png">
					</figure>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Bats fly back and forth in a cave at night to find their food.</span> While flying at night, a bat emits squeaks that reflect off
					the walls of caves and flying insects. These squeaks return to the bat's nervous system and are used as clues to
					determine the location and shape of the objects. The bat can tell where the next meal is and when to avoid other
					objects.</p>

					<p>A motion sensor (also called an ultrasonic detector) uses technology for a similar purpose. A motion sensor uses a
					motion detector that sends out high frequency sound waves to a target object and waits for the sound wave to come
					back. The motion sensor measures the time needed for the wave to leave and return to the detector. What is so unique
					about a motion sensor is that software can determine and display the distance a wave covered based on the speed of
					sound in a graph.</p>
