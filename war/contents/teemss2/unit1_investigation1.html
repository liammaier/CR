				<p>Discovery Question: How can we describe sounds?</p>

				<p>Students explore the characteristics of sound by using a microphone and software that displays sound waveforms.
				They study how the waveform is changed by changing loudness, pitch, and other qualities of the sound.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>It's sometimes hard to describe sounds! One way to explore them more carefully is to display and observe the sound
				vibrations on a graph. When something vibrates, it moves back and forth in a regular way, often so fast that you need
				a computer's help to see the pattern. This is what you will observe in this investigation.</p>

						<p>Most sounds have many frequencies in them, and not just one, even though they sound like one pitch. The
						Sound Grapher has a special "Frequencies" feature to display these frequencies. Try making different kinds of
						sounds and look at what frequencies are present in them. Refer to <strong>Technical Hint: Frequency Grapher</strong> to use
						the Frequencies feature of the Sound Grapher.</p>
