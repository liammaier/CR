				<h2>Thinking About The Question</h2>

				<p class="red"><span class="first-sentence">How do populations adjust to changing environments?</span></p>

				<p>In the natural world, the environment is constantly changing. The weather in a region may get wetter or drier. A plant
				species that some animal depended on for food may be crowded out by another plant species. A new predator or
				competing species may spread into the area.</p>

				<p>Suppose a region gradually has less and less rainfall over many years. It has a mixture of plants, some of which are
				more tolerant of drought than others. Describe what you think will happen to the plant life in the region over these
				years. Be prepared to discuss your thoughts with the class.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>Suppose that the seeds of a certain kind of cactus in that region are not all the same. Some of them sprout even if there
				is little rain. Others produce plants whose leaves conserve internal moisture better when it gets dry. Others have
				slightly deeper root systems. Describe how you think that cactus species might change over many generations.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">2</span></div>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>An individual cactus can't "learn" to have a deeper root system. Yet over many generations, this species may develop
				a deeper root system if it helps with survival in times of drought. How do you think this is possible? Be prepared to
				discuss your thoughts with the class.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>"Adaptation" -- how plant and animal populations change in response to their environment -- is possible because of
				this process, which is called natural selection. Natural selection occurs when organisms with certain traits tend to
				survive and reproduce more than organisms without those traits. They pass those traits to their offspring. In time, a
				larger percentage of the population has those traits. If a trait is favored by the environment in this way, it is said there
				is a "selection pressure" for that trait. The selective breeding of domestic animals -- for example, choosing cows that
				give more milk or sheep that have better wool -- uses human-caused selection pressure.</p>

				<p>The model of sheep and grass will help you explore the process of adaptation through selection -- both natural
				selection and selective breeding.</p>

				<h2>Trial 1 - Better teeth</h2>

				<ol>
					<li><span class="first-sentence">Picture yourself as a farmer with a large field of sheep.</span> You start with an equal number of males (horns) and
					females (no horns). They live for six years. The sheep move around the field and eat grass, which grows back
					at a certain rate. The patch is green if there is grass, and brown if there is no grass. In the model, the sheep
					move and eat during each year. They use up energy as they move, and they gain energy from eating grass. If
					their energy goes to zero, they die.</li>

					<li>
						<p>Open the Sheep Adaptation model. See <strong>Technical Hint: Running NetLogo</strong> to run and save the NetLogo
						model.</p>

						</figure>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Here are the features of this model:</p>

						<p>The sheep have one variable trait -- the quality of their teeth. The ones with better teeth get more energy from
						the grass they eat, so they are less likely to lose energy and die as they wander around the field. This trait is
						turned on if SELECTION? = ON. It has no effect if SELECTION? = OFF.</p>

						<p>There are three levels of teeth:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>TEETH = 1.2 better</li>

							<li>TEETH = 1.0 standard</li>

							<li>TEETH = 0.8 worse</li>
						</ul>

						<p>The quality of better teeth is an example of a trait that is favored by the environment, because sheep with
						better teeth are more likely to survive and reproduce. This is called <span class="bold">selection pressure</span>.</p>

						<p>Once a year, from age 3 to age 6, each female sheep gives birth to a baby. The baby inherits its TEETH trait
						from both its parents.</p>

						<p>If SELECTION? = ON, what do you think will happen to the average value of TEETH over time?</p>

						<p>Here's a challenge, designed to test our theory that the sheep population gradually has better teeth over several
						generations because the ones with worse teeth starve to death more often. If that's true, think about the effect

						would happen to how fast the trait of better teeth would become common in the population?</p>

						<ol>
							<li>Better teeth would become common more quickly.</li>

						<p>People use the word "adaptation" in many ways. In this situation, the individual sheep does NOT adapt,

						<p>Create a short story of deer that become separated by a large desert that they don't like to cross. They live
						separately in two somewhat different habitats. One is mainly forest and the other is mainly grasslands. How
						might the two groups be different after 10,000 years?</p>

						<p>Instead of a rancher removing some sheep each year, imagine natural predators, such as wolves. How would
						this have the same or a different effect on the genetic features of the sheep, compared to selection by a
						rancher? (Hint: what are the features of a sheep that a rancher or a wolf is most likely to remove?)</p>

						<p>Think about these two theories about how giraffes acquired long necks.</p>

						<p>Theory 1: As they grew up, giraffes stretched out their necks to reach higher in trees for leaves. The babies
						inherited their parents' longer necks. This was repeated every generation until all giraffes had longer necks.</p>

						<p>Theory 2: There were different neck lengths in the giraffe population, due to natural variations and mutations.
						The giraffes with longer necks were more successful getting food because they could reach higher into the
						trees. They were more likely to reproduce, and their babies inherited their longer neck feature. Gradually there
						were more giraffes with long necks than short necks. Over many generations, the average neck length of
						giraffes increased.</p>

						<p>Which theory do you think is more correct, and why?</p>
