				<h2>Thinking About The Question</h2>

				<p class="red"><span class="first-sentence">How can you extract water from the air?</span></p>

				<p>As you discovered in Investigation 1, much of the water cycle is visible, both in the form of liquid water (oceans,
				rivers, lakes, precipitation such as rain) and in the form of solid water (ice or snow, precipitation such as falling snow
				or hail). However, a fraction of the water in the water cycle is invisible in that it is held as a gas in the air. This
				invisible amount of water accounts for about 0.001% of all water on earth. What do you think would happen to the
				water cycle if this "invisible" water did not exist? Get together with your group members and discuss this question.
				Write your thoughts below.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>Think of situations where water goes from invisible to visible and vice versa. Get together with your group members
				and create a list of instances when this occurs. Be prepared to discuss your ideas with the class.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>One situation when this occurs is when dew forms on grass. At what times of the day does dew typically form and
				why?</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">2</span></div>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>The formation of dew has to do with temperature, specifically a temperature called the "dew point." This is the
				temperature at which air becomes saturated with water and produces condensation such as dew. From your past
				experience, when do you think dew forms? Does it form when the temperature of a surface drops, or when the
				temperature of a surface rises? Be prepared to share your answer with the class.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>One key to the formation of dew and other types of condensation such as rain, sleet, and snow is that air of different
				temperatures can hold different amounts of water. Warmer air can hold more water and colder air can hold less water.</p>

				<p>If you had a cubic meter of air at 10 degrees C and a cubic meter of air at 20 degrees C, and both volumes of air were
				holding as much water as they could hold, which would be holding more water?</p>

				<h2>Further Investigations</h2>

				<ul>
					<li><span class="first-sentence">Describe how water can move from the ocean to land using your understanding of evaporation, air
					temperature, dew point and precipitation.</span> Draw a schematic picture of this.</li>

					<li>Evaporation is one way in which water goes into the air. Transpiration -- plants giving off water -- is another.
					Research the process of transpiration. How much of the water in the earth's atmosphere is a result of
					transpiration? How much water does an average tree transpire into the air per day?</li>

					<li>Track temperatures, dew points, humidity levels, and weather patterns in your local area over several months.
					(<a href="http://www.weather.gov/">http://www.weather.gov/</a>)</li>

					<li>Research the question: Does water evaporate in space?</li>

					<li>Figure out what the water density is in various places -- in your classroom, outside on a field or playground, or
					at home. Does it differ in various places? Why?</li>
