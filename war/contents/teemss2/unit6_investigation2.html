				<p>As we discussed earlier in Investigation 1, changes in water temperature affect fish. Like water, air is a fluid, and
				changes in air temperature affect you! Most likely you have felt a room or a car warm up from air coming out of a
				heating vent, or you have felt the temperature change from opening a window. You will investigate what happens to
				temperature when you open a window.</p>

				<p>Using the Drawing Tool, make a sketch of what you think will happen to the temperature in the room when you open
				the window. Refer to <strong>Technical Hint: Using the drawing tool</strong> to use the Drawing Tool.</p>
