				<p>How does breathing support life?</p>

				<p>We can survive several weeks without food, several days without water, but only a few minutes without air. Breathing
				is a constant cycle of intake and exhaust. To demonstrate this, have one member of your group use a paper towel to
				clean and dry a small hand mirror. Have them hold the mirror near, but not touching their mouth. Have them exhale
				onto the mirror two or three times. Examine the surface of the mirror. What happened to the mirror? Be prepared to
				share your results with the class.</p>

						<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>If one were to look at the anatomy of a leaf, one could see how these elements are absorbed by the leaf so that
						they can form food. Leaves have a structure called a stoma by which this transfer of ingredients occurs. The
						stoma provides an opening to the inside of the leaf. These stomata (plural of stoma) are most numerous on the
						underside of the leaf. They can open and close, depending on the conditions. CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) and H<sub>2</sub>O
						(water) from the surrounding atmosphere are transported to and from the plant. Light shining on the leaf
						provides energy for the chemical reactions. The whole process of turning light energy into chemical energy
						for the plant is called photosynthesis.</p>
