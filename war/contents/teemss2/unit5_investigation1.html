				<p>Later in this activity, you are going to design and build playground equipment for an egg! To help you investigate this
				equipment, you are going to use a force sensor. A force sensor measures "pushes" and "pulls." Why would it be
				important to know how much your egg is being pushed and pulled in your playground?</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>As a playground designer, it is also important to learn about motion. By using a motion sensor, you can get an idea of
				how far and how fast your egg is going. Why would this be important?</p>

					<h3>Technical Hint - Zeroing the Force Sensor</h3>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">The force sensor may not read zero when there is no force on it.</span> The software for zeroing the force sensor is not ready
					yet. For now, when you take a force measurement, subtract the starting force from that measurement to obtain a true
					reading.</p>

					<p>For example, if you lift an object and the force sensor reads 15 N, and it reads 2 N before you have lifted anything,
					then the true weight of the object is 15 - 2 = 13 N.</p>
