				<p><span class="red">How do we make sounds and how do we hear sounds?</span></p>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">Sounds come from things that vibrate.</span> A vibration is something moving back and forth in a regular way. Some things
				vibrate and make sounds that we can hear. All musical instruments have some part of them that vibrates and makes the
				musical sound.</p>

				<p>You can see how sounds are vibrations by building a model. Build a balloon drum by stretching a balloon over one
				end of a tin can that has both ends open. Working together, stretch the balloon tight and hold it in place by putting a
				rubber band around the edge.</p>

				<p>Talk into the open bottom of the tin can while touching the balloon.</p>

				<p>c. How do you think the vibrations get from your mouth to the drum?</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>Talk into the open bottom of the tin can after placing a paper clip on the drumhead. Can you make the paper clip

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">3</span></div>

				<p>Your voice makes the drumhead vibrate up and down. These vibrations are very fast, and they make sounds that we
				can hear. The drum you have built is a good model of the eardrum.</p>

				<p>Explain how you think the sound of your voice moves the paper clip. Be prepared to share your ideas with the class.</p>
