					<p>Freehand tool. The freehand tool lets you draw freehand. When you draw, a selection rectangle appears around your
					drawing. You can use this rectangle to move your freehand drawing, change its color or delete it. To learn more about
					changing an object's color, read the Color Tool description below. To learn more about deleting an object, read about
					the Delete button below.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig1-4.png">
