				<p class="bold">Graph, describe, and duplicate motion</p>

				<p><span class="bold">sensors:</span> motion</p>

				<p>Discovery Question: When am I changing velocity or accelerating?</p>

				<p>Students observe already existing motion graphs and describe the motions needed to make the graph and test their
				descriptions by reproducing the original graphs while using a motion sensor. The students calculate velocity at various
				locations on motion graphs and explore the relationship between velocity and acceleration while tracking their own
				motion.</p>

				<h2>Thinking About The Question</h2>

				<p class="red"><span class="first-sentence">When am I changing velocity or accelerating?</span></p>

				<p>Imagine you are a marine biologist and you want to track the movements of whales in the ocean. What information
				about the movements of the whale would you want to know? Where is the whale? What is the whale's position? How
				fast is the whale traveling? How does the motion of the whale relate to other moving objects?</p>

				<p>Think about other professions. A racecar driver wants to know how fast she can reach a certain speed. A baseball
				player wants to know how fast a pitcher throws a fastball. What information about the movements of other objects in
				motion are you interested in finding out about? Discuss these questions with your group and write down some of your
				examples and questions to share with the class.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>There is technology that helps scientists to answer questions about motion. For example, many ships use sonar to find
				objects at the bottom of the ocean and to view objects, like whales, as the ship draws near them. A motion sensor (also
				called an ultrasonic detector) uses technology for a similar purpose. Refer to <strong>Technical Hint: Learning how the motion
				sensor works</strong> to learn how a motion sensor works.</p>

				<p>Observe the following graph.</p>

				<p>This graph shows the movement of a car on a 4-meter straight race track as displayed by a motion sensor. What facts

					<li>
						<p>Why would changing velocity, otherwise known as acceleration, be shown as a curve on the graph? The black
						lines, called tangents, meet the curve at a single point and show the slope of the curve, and hence the velocity,
						at that point. Notice that if the line is curved, the slopes of the tangents are constantly changing. Hence the
						velocities are changing as well.</p>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Bats fly back and forth in a cave at night to find their food.</span> While flying at night, a bat emits squeaks that reflect off
					the walls of caves and flying insects. These squeaks return to the bat's nervous system and are used as clues to
					determine the location and shape of the objects. The bat can tell where the next meal is and when to avoid other
					objects.</p>

					<p>A motion sensor (also called an ultrasonic detector) uses technology for a similar purpose. A motion sensor uses a
					motion detector that sends out high frequency sound waves to a target object and waits for the sound wave to come
					back. The motion sensor measures the time needed for the wave to leave and return to the detector. What is so unique
					about a motion sensor is that software can determine and display the distance a wave covered based on the speed of
					sound in a graph.</p>
