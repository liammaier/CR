				<p class="red"><span class="first-sentence">How do you inhale and exhale with your lungs</span>?</p>

				<p>To investigate this question, you are going to use a model.</p>

				<p>Have you every made a paper airplane or played with a toy car or doll? These are models, which in some way
				resemble their real counterparts. Have you ever used a flight simulator? Again, this is a model made to help people
				learn how to fly an aircraft. Often scientists make models, picking and choosing what aspects are most important to
				include in the model.</p>

				<p>Look at the paper airplane below. How does this model resemble or behave like the real thing?</p>

						<p>For a fixed amount of air, establish that PV=constant. You can use a syringe connected to an air pressure
						sensor and take pressure readings at various volumes.</p>

						<p>If you use the volume of a sphere to estimate the volume of a balloon, you are using the sphere volume
						equation as a mathematical model for balloon volume. How accurate is this model? Try performing several
						experiments with various diameter balloons. Calculate the volume of the balloon and then measure the volume
						of the balloon. Make a chart of balloon diameters, measured volumes and calculated volumes.</p>
