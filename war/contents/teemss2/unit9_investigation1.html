				<div class="short-answer"></div>

				<p>Slowly turn your whole body to the left (counterclockwise). Describe where you are facing so that it is sunset, then
				midnight, then sunrise for the person on your nose. Be prepared to demonstrate this to the class.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>The earth rotates once every 24 hours. Pretend that one second is an hour. The teacher will count out 24 seconds. Start
				at midnight, and turn your body very slowly so that it ends up at midnight again, 24 seconds later. What time of day is

				<p>The teacher will show you a globe, and point out some features of its geometry. Observe them carefully and then look
				at the picture below. Draw a line from each label to that feature on the earth, using the line tool. See <strong>Technical Hint:
				Using the drawing tool</strong> for using the Drawing Tool. Here are the definitions of these features:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The <span class="bold">earth's axis</span>: the line around which it rotates</li>

					<li>The <span class="bold">north pole</span>: one end of the axis</li>

					<li>The <span class="bold">south pole</span>: the other end of the axis</li>

					<li>The <span class="bold">equator</span>: the circle halfway between the north and south poles</li>

					<li>The <span class="bold">prime meridian</span>: the half-circle running from the north pole to the south pole through Greenwich,
					England.</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="essay-answer">drawing:</div>

				<p>There is a standard way of locating points on earth, called <span class="bold">latitude</span> and <span class="bold">longitude</span>.</p>

				<p>Latitude measures your distance north or south of the equator. It is measured in degrees. The equator is 0 degrees
				latitude. The north pole is 90 degrees N, and the south pole is 90 degrees S.</p>

				<p>On the classroom globe, find the approximate latitude of your town. Be prepared to discuss your findings with the
				class.<br/>
				Your latitude =</p>

				<div class="short-answer"></div>

				<p>Longitude measures your distance around the earth. It is measured east or west of a line from the north pole to the
				south pole, through Greenwich, England. It is called the prime meridian, and it is 0 degrees longitude. Longitude
				circles run from the north pole to the south pole. America is west of England, so the longitudes of places in America
				have values like 90 degrees W. India is east of England, so the longitudes of places in India are values like 75 degrees
				E.</p>

						<p><span class="first-sentence">Measure how the intensity of reflected sunlight changes as the sun gets higher or lower in the sky.</span> On a piece
						of stiff white card, at least 20 x 20 cm (8 x 8 in), mount a vertical screw or toothpick about 2 cm (3/4 in) long.
						Pick a day with a clear sky and bright sunlight. Measure the surface brightness with the light sensor compared
						to the length of the shadow. As the sun gets lower in the sky, the length of the shadow will increase, so the
						length of the shadow is a way to measure the height of the sun in the sky. If the light is too bright for the range
						of your sensor, cover the sensor with layers of masking tape until it does not reach its maximum even when
						pointed at the brightest reflecting surface.</p>

						temperature sensor to the back of a dark piece of paper. Move the paper from shadow into full sunlight, each
