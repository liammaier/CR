				<p class="red"><span class="first-sentence">How do I mix water in a fish tank to adjust the temperature?</span></p>

				<p>Think about the two situations below.</p>

				<p>A cold mountain stream flows into a large, warm lake. What effect does the cold mountain stream have on the
				temperature of the lake? Discuss this question with your group and write down your answers.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>A pet store manager adds a liter of cold water to a warm 50-liter fish tank to replenish the water supply. What effect
				does the added water have on the temperature of the tank water? Discuss this question with your group and write
				down your answers.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>In both cases, the temperature affects the fish and other underwater plants and animals. Which situation do you think
				would be more difficult to investigate and why? Put a mark in the check box of the more difficult situation and

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>In a scientific investigation, it's often good to start with simpler situations. You will start by mixing two cups of water
				at different temperatures. This is like the fish tank example above. Can you think of at least two other situations like
				this? Discuss this question with your group and write down your answers.</p>

				<h2>Analysis</h2>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<p><span class="first-sentence">Trying to find patterns or trends in your data can be puzzling.</span> Sometimes it seems like a jumble until you find
						a good way to display or arrange your data. As a scientist, you have many tools you can use, like tables and
						charts, plus your math abilities. One way to look at the data from the table in Trial 2 is as follows: If you
						mixed one canister of water at temperature 1 and one canister of water at temperature 2, the final cup holds
						two canisters of water at temperature 3. The illustration below shows this. (The two 'temp 3' canisters would
						actually be mixed together.)</p>

						<p>Using the Drawing Tool and the drawing of canisters below, fill in your temperature values from the Mixture
						1 line of your table. Refer to <strong>Technical Hint: Using the drawing tool</strong> to use the Drawing Tool.</p>

					<li>
						<p>Create the same type of drawings for the Mixture 2, 3, and 4 lines in your table. Refer to <strong>Technical Hint:
						Using the drawing tool</strong> to use the Drawing Tool.</p>

						<p>You can use the "rubber stamps" on the Drawing Toolbar to create canisters.</p>

					<li>
						<p>Do you see any patterns that could help you predict Temperature 3 for each mixture and, if so, what is the
						pattern? You can use text, drawings or symbols, or anything else you think would help best describe what you
						see.</p>

				<h2>Further Investigations</h2>

				<ul>
					<li><span class="first-sentence">Can you come up with an equation that could help someone else accurately predict the final temperature for
					three different volumes of water mixing, while only knowing the initial temperatures and volumes?</span></li>

					<li>You have a bathtub that has 60 liters of 30 degrees Celsius water in it and you want to bring the temperature
					up to 40 degrees Celsius. What is the least number of readings you can make with the temperature sensor to
					get your desired final temperature? Note: you can try this with a bathtub at home, or do it on a smaller scale
					using cups of water in the classroom.</li>
