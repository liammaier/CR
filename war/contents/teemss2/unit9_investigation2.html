				<ol>
					<li>
						<p><span class="first-sentence">To test this question, you will lay out a model of the earth's real orbit.</span> The earth's distance from the sun varies
						from 147 million kilometers to 152 million kilometers. Your model will have 1 cm representing 1 million km,
						so the earth's distance will vary from 147 cm to 152 cm.</p>

						<p>Use the CD that was taped on the floor in Trial 1 to represent the sun. Tape down sheets of plain paper in four
						directions from the CD. Their centers should be about 150 cm from the CD. Use two meter sticks together to
						measure 150 cm.</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig18-5.png">
						</figure>
					</li>

					<li>Remember that the earth moves counterclockwise around the sun. Draw an arrow on each sheet of paper to
					indicate which direction the earth is moving, as shown.</li>

					<li>
						<p>On each sheet of paper, mark three distances from the CD: 147 cm, 150 cm, and 152 cm.</p>

					<li>On one of the sheets of paper make a bold line through the 152 cm mark. Label it "aphelion" or "farthest
					distance" and "July 4." On the sheet opposite it make a strong line through the 147 cm mark. Label it
					"perihelion" or "nearest distance" and "January 4." These are approximate dates. Perhaps you are surprised
					that the earth is farthest away from the sun on July 4!</li>

					<li>
						<p>On the other two sheets of paper make a bold line through the 150 cm mark. Label them "April" and

					<li>In Trial 1 you found that the brightness of your "sun" changes dramatically as the distance changes from 150
					cm to 25 cm. In reality the earth's orbit is almost round. Its distance changes a small percentage during the
					year, from 147 million km to 152 million km. Now you will measure the change in light level due to this
					small change in distance.</li>

					<li>Connect the light sensor to the computer. Refer to <strong>Technical Hint: Connecting the Vernier light sensor</strong> to
					connect the light sensor.</li>

					<li>The teacher will set up a bare light bulb on the CD at the center and darken the room.</li>

					<li>
						<p>Around the circle, there may be variations because the light bulb isn't equally bright in all directions. So take
						your measurements at one of the four sheets of paper around the circle. Point the light sensor directly at the
						light bulb, a few inches (10 cm) above the floor. Measure the brightness at each of the three distances marked
						on the sheet of paper. Refer to <strong>Technical Hint: Recording a single measurement</strong> to record a single
						measurement. Note: Your light sensor may look different from this picture. Refer to Refer to <strong>Technical Hint:
