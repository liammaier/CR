				<h2>Thinking About The Question</h2>

				<p class="red"><span class="first-sentence">What happens to a living plant throughout the day and night?</span></p>

				<p>How does the 24-hour day/night cycle affect the release of water vapor by plants?</p>

				<p>The turning of the earth on its axis causes a regular and predictable daily cycle of light and darkness. Animals, plants
				and even microbes have built-in timepieces that help them know when to eat, when to rest, and when to wake up.</p>

				<p>How does the day differ from the night? Think about differences in light, temperature, humidity, and other things that
				might matter to a plant.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>Draw your impression of a 24-hour day/night cycle. Label your drawing to show the lightest and darkest parts of the
				daily cycle. Label the warmest and coolest parts of the daily cycle. Refer to <strong>Technical Hint: Using the drawing tool</strong> to
				use the Drawing Tool. Be prepared to share your drawing with the class.</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">drawing:</div>

				<p>Draw three graphs showing the changes in light, temperature and humidity over a 24-hour period. Use a different

				<h2>Trial 1 - Leaves and light</h2>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<p><span class="first-sentence">In Investigation 1 you observed that leaves give off water vapor when they "breathe" just as humans do.</span>
						Do leaves transpire (give off water vapor) all day and all night, or just part of the time? Show what you think
						the cycle is by drawing a graph of transpiration from a leaf over a 24-hour period. The start of the graph is
						midnight, and the middle of the graph is noon.</p>

						<figure>
							<img class="center" src="/contents/teemss2/images/butterfly.png">
						</figure>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>One of the big changes between day and night is the amount of light. How could light level affect the amount
						of transpiration from a leaf? Be prepared to discuss your ideas with the class.</p>

						<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>To see if light level has an effect on transpiration, you will bag a leaf with a relative humidity sensor and then
						observe it for a full 24 hours. In this trial you will set up this experiment and do a "practice run".</p>

						<p>Divide your class into two different groups for a 24-hour test. One group will monitor the relative humidity
						near a living leaf for 24 hours. The other group will monitor the light level falling on that leaf. If you have
						enough equipment, form several pairs of groups.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Choose a potted plant and place the plant near a window with plenty of daylight. Each plant will need one
						humidity group and one light-level group.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Pick a broad healthy leaf or two. Bag the leaf with a clear plastic bag. <span class="bold">Leave the bag slightly open</span>, so that air
						can circulate slowly in and out of the bag. This is so that when the leaf stops transpiring, you will detect it
						because the humidity will drop down.</p>

						<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">6</span></div>

						<figure>
							<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig16-2.png">
						</figure>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>If you are with the humidity group, place the relative humidity sensor in the bag with the leaf. The opening in
						the sensor that reads humidity should be close to the underside of the leaf, because that is where the leaf
						stomata are the most numerous. Refer to <strong>Technical Hint: Connecting the Vernier relative humidity sensor</strong> to
						connect the relative humidity sensor.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>If you are with the light-level group, place the light sensor near the bagged leaf, pointing upward so that the
						sensor and the leaf receive about the same amount of light. Refer to <strong>Technical Hint: Connecting the Vernier
						light sensor</strong> to connect the light sensor.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Start recording with the relative humidity sensor and the light sensor. See <strong>Technical Hint: Recording a series
						of measurements</strong> to record a series of measurements.</p>

					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Stop recording after 15 minutes. Discuss your findings and compare them with other groups. Could you detect
						transpiration from the leaf? Do you think the humidity sensor is close enough to the leaf to obtain a good
						reading? Do you think the bag is too open or too closed? Is the light sensor giving you the true light level that is falling on the leaf? Be prepared to share your observations with the class.</p>

						<p><span class="first-sentence">Think about the stomata openings we learned about in Investigation 1.</span> The stomata are the plant's 'lungs'. It
						uses them to breathe and exchange gases like we do. They are most numerous on the underside of the leaf.

						<p>Guard cells surround the stomata openings. In light the guard cells swell, causing the pore to open. In the dark
						or under drought conditions the guard cells close the stomata and no photosynthesis takes place. Opening of
						the stomata allows CO<sub>2</sub> to move and spread into the leaf, and it also allows water vapor to move out of the
						leaf. The release of water from leaves through their stomata is called transpiration.</p>
