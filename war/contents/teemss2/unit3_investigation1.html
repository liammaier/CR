				<p><span class="first-sentence">In this investigation, you will use an electronic sensor to measure temperature.</span> It's a kind of thermometer. Your
				teacher will demonstrate the electronic temperature sensor and a regular thermometer side by side. They give about
				the same result.</p>

				<p>Our skin is very sensitive to temperature. We often use our fingers to sense how hot or cold something is. What if you
				couldn't feel hot or cold? What problems would that create for you?</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>Suppose you touched two things and it felt like they were different temperatures, but a thermometer measured the
				same temperature for both. Which would you believe, your finger or the thermometer?<br/>Choose one.</p>

				<p class="indented">I would believe my finger.</p>
