				<h2>Thinking About The Question</h2>

				<p class="red"><span class="first-sentence">Can you design a greenhouse to maintain a good environment for different plants?</span></p>

				<p>Over the centuries, people have developed many plants as sources of food. Farmers continuously select new varieties
				that are more productive, tastier, more resistant to diseases, or more suitable to the market in one way or another. Each
				species has its unique personality. It prefers particular conditions that the farmer must provide in order to get the best
				crop.</p>

				<p>For example, tomatoes and cucumbers love warm temperatures and lots of sunshine throughout their growing season.
				They also need continuous watering for best fruit production. By contrast, lettuce is a cool-weather crop. It does well
				in spring and fall. If temperatures are too hot, it will "bolt," which means it makes a hard stalk and has bitter leaves. It
				should be in the shade in hot weather.</p>

				<p>Here is a diagram of a typical greenhouse. The dotted line shows the daily path of the sun. Using the text tool, label
				the area in the greenhouse that has each of the following conditions over the course of the day. Refer to <strong>Technical
				Hint: Using the drawing tool</strong> to use the Drawing Tool.</p>

				<p>BRIGHT<br/>
				SHADY<br/>
				VERY SHADY<br/>
				HOTTEST<br/>
				MODERATE<br/>
				COOLEST</p>

				<figure>
					<img class="center" src="/contents/teemss2/images/butterfly.png">
				</figure>

				<p>Using the Drawing Tool, sketch the lettuce and tomato plants where you think they would thrive. You can use the
				lettuce and tomato "stamps" on the Drawing Tool palette. Refer to<strong> Technical Hint: Using the drawing tool</strong> to use the
				drawing tool.</p>

				<p>What modifications could you make to the greenhouse to help these vegetables grow even better? Be prepared to
				discuss your ideas with the class.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">2</span></div>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>In Investigation 1, you explored how a greenhouse can protect plants from low temperatures and large changes in
				temperature. This is the main purpose of a greenhouse.</p>

				<p>In this investigation, you will explore how conditions can be different in different locations in a greenhouse. This is
				also an important design issue, because different plants prefer different conditions.</p>

						<p>In this trial, you are going to design and build a greenhouse that includes different zones to satisfy different

						greenhouse, which is also an important issue. You can work as a class or in groups, but your design should
						address the following criteria:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Temperature: One area is 4-8 degrees C warmer than another area.</li>

							<li>Light: One area receives half as much light as another area.</li>

							<li>Relative humidity: One area has a greater relative humidity than another area.</li>
