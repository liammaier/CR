				<h2>Unit 11 - Air pressure - Investigation - 1 - Exploring air pressure</h2>

				<p class="bold">Explore soda bottles, balloons and lungs</p>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">This unit addresses NSES standards for inquiry and physical science at grades 5-8 and NCTM standards on Algebra
				and Data Analysis at grades 6-8.</span></p>

				<p><span class="bold">sensors:</span> gas pressure</p>

				<p>Discovery Question: What can you do with air pressure?</p>

				<p>Students use an air pressure sensor to measure air pressure in the classroom and in empty juice boxes. Students use the
				differences in air pressure to investigate net forces and explain the behavior of the juice box.</p>

				<h2>Thinking About The Question</h2>

				<p class="red"><span class="first-sentence">What can you do with air pressure?</span></p>

				<p>What is pressure? Have you or anyone in your group ever stepped on a small sharp rock with your bare feet? How
				does it feel?</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig21-2.png">
				</figure>

				<p>Why do you think it feels this way? The answer has to do with pressure. Normally, when you take a step, the force of
				your step is spread out over the entire size of your foot. Your foot is used to this kind of pressure -- you experience it
				all the time. But if you step on a small rock, all that force is concentrated on a small area. If the rock surface is 100
				times as small as your foot, what you feel is 100 times more force on that area of your foot -- 100 times the pressure!</p>

				<p>Clearly the weight of your body puts pressure on your feet, but does air have pressure? Look at the pictures below.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">2</span></div>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig21-3.png">
				</figure>

				<p>Tires, balls, and dive tanks are just a few of the things that people use that rely on air pressure. Choose one item and
				describe how air and air pressure help the item function.</p>

				<p class="indented">Tire</p>

				<p class="indented">Basketball</p>

				<p class="indented">Dive tank</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>Air is actually exerting pressure on you right now. You are at the bottom of the earth's atmosphere, and about 400
				miles of air is pushing on you! But you have air in your body, which is pushing back, so you don't feel the pressure.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">3</span></div>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig21-4.png">
				</figure>

				<p>Has anyone in your group ever experienced ear popping when taking off or landing in a plane, or when driving up or
				down a mountain?</p>

				<p class="indented">Yes</p>

				<p class="indented">No</p>

				<p>This is another example of air pressure effects. When the air pressure outside your body is different than the air
				pressure inside your body, your body tries to adjust to the outside air pressure. These adjustments create a popping
				sound in your ear.</p>

				<p>Can you think of other examples where air pressure is apparent? Discuss with your group situations or objects affected
				by air pressure and list these below. Be prepared to share your ideas with the class.</p>

					changing an object's color, read the Color Tool description below. To learn more about deleting an object, read about
					the Delete button below.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig1-4.png">

					<p>Line tool. The line tool lets you draw lines. Click and drag to create a line. After the line is created, you can click on it
					to select it, move it, change its size, shape, color or delete it.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig1-5.png">
