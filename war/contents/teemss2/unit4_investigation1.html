				<h2>Thinking About The Question</h2>

				<p><span class="red">What types of clouds make rain or snow?</span></p>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">Think about a glass of ice water sitting outside on a hot, humid day.</span> What forms on the outside of the glass of ice
				water?</p>

				<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

				<p>Temperature is the major factor affecting the amount of invisible moisture air can hold at any given time. Cooler air
				cannot hold as much water in the gaseous form as warmer air. As the air cools around the glass, the water vapor in air
				changes from a gas to a liquid to form water droplets on the side of the glass. This change of the water from a vapor to
				liquid water is called condensation.</p>

				<p>This is not unlike what happens in clouds. Clouds form when warm, moist air rises and cools. For clouds to form, the
				water vapor must have something to condense around. There are all sorts of very small (microscopic) particles in the
				air like dust, soot, pollen, bits of rock, salt from the sea, and smoke from car exhaust or factories. What we see as fog
				or clouds is tiny droplets of water that have condensed onto these particles.</p>

				<p>Clouds may look solid at a distance, but up close they are just like fog.</p>

				<p>Your teacher is filling the bottom of a small glass bottle with around 2 cm of very warm water. He or she will check
				that the temperature of the water is between 40 and 80 degrees C by using a temperature sensor. Refer to Technical
				<strong>Hint: Connecting the Vernier temperature sensor</strong> to connect the temperature sensor. Refer to <strong>Technical Hint:
				Recording a single measurement</strong> to record a single measurement.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>Your teacher will light a match and after it burns for a couple of seconds, he or she will blow it out. Your teacher will
				place the match in the opening of the bottle so that the smoke drifts into the bottle or he or she may gently blow the
				smoke into the bottle. Your teacher will then place a small piece of clear plastic wrap on the top of the smoke-filled
				bottle and secure the wrap with a rubber band. Observe and describe below what happens inside the bottle when an ice
				cube is placed on top of the plastic wrap.</p>

						<p>High altitude winds affect cloud movements that bring changes in weather. The direction of these winds can

						<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

					<li>
						<p>At higher altitudes, winds can move considerably faster and in a definite direction. A convex mirror marked
						with the points on a compass (i.e., N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) helps you safely view clouds and indicates
						the direction of the cloud movement. This type of device is easy to make. Obtain a round convex mirror.
						Notice that the mirror is not flat. This will help you see clouds across the full sky.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Place and attach the convex mirror in the center of a piece of poster board. Most mirrors of this type have

				<h2>Trial 2 - Classifying clouds</h2>

				<ol>

					<li>
						<p><span class="first-sentence">There are many different types of clouds.</span> Observing the shape, color, and altitude of clouds can sometimes
						tell us about what the weather will be like in the hours and days ahead. Let's look at the different ways to
						classify clouds.</p>

						<p><span class="bold">Shape</span>: There are two different shapes or forms of clouds. They are either "heaped" (cumulus) or "spread
						sheeted" (stratus).</p>

						<p>The dense, huge masses of varying heights are called cumulus clouds.</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig7-4.png">
						</figure>

						<p>Cumulus<br/>
						http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Bluesky2.jpg</p>

						<p>The low, horizontal sheets of layered, lifted fog are called stratus clouds.</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig7-5.png">
						</figure>

						<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">9</span></div>

						<p>Stratus<br/>
						http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Stratus.jpg</p>

						<p>Clouds that are both heaped and spread out in layers are called stratocumulus clouds because they're a bit like
						stratus and a bit like cumulus clouds.</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig7-6.png">
						</figure>

						<p>Stratocumulus<br/>
						http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Stratocumulus-cylinders.jpg</p>

						<p><span class="bold">Color:</span> When the color changes from a fluffy white to a dark cloud, the word nimbus is added to the beginning
						or ending of the cloud form. For example, a dark cumulus cloud with a dark base that is threatening to rain or
						hail is called a cumulonimbus cloud.</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig7-7.png">
						</figure>

						<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">10</span></div>

						<p>Cumulonimbus<br/>
						http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Big_Cumulonimbus.JPG</p>

						<p>A dark gray horizontal stratus cloud that is threatening to snow, rain, or drizzle is called a nimbostratus cloud.</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig7-8.png">
						</figure>

						<p>Nimbostratus<br/>
						http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Nimbostratus_praecipitatio.JPG</p>

						<p><span class="bold">Height:</span> The altitude above the ground can also describe clouds. Usually clouds are classified as low, medium,
						or high. Towering layered clouds that may extend to over 20,000 meters in height form a separate category
						called vertical clouds. Vertical clouds that have strong updrafts of air are associated with sometimes
						dangerous precipitation, winds, storms, and even tornadoes. There can be very strong rain and hail from these
						clouds.</p>

						<p><span class="bold">Low:</span> Clouds that range in height from 0 to 2000 meters are classified as low clouds. When many cumulus
						clouds appear in a layer over a large area of the sky these clouds are called stratocumulus. When the prefix
						strato- is used with the word cumulus it means a layer of cumulus clouds.</p>

						<p><span class="bold">Medium:</span> Clouds that range in height from 2000 to 5000 meters are classified as medium clouds. Often the
						prefix alto- is used to indicate a specific medium height cloud. Altocumulus clouds often show up in regular
						patterns of rolls or puffs.</p>

						<p><span class="bold">High:</span> Clouds whose bases are above 5000 meters are classified as high clouds. Often the prefix cirro- is used
						to indicate a specific high cloud height. Cirrus clouds are high level clouds that develop in filaments or wispy
						patches. Cirrocumulus clouds have a spotty appearance created by the many small patches. All of these clouds
						are so high and the air so cold that when water vapor condenses, it forms tiny ice crystals instead of water droplets.</p>
