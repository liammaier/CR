				<h2>Thinking About The Question</h2>

				<p class="red"><span class="first-sentence">How can simple tools called simple machines decrease the amount of force you need to move objects?</span></p>

				<p>Before engines and motors were invented, people had to do things like lifting heavy loads by hand. Using an animal
				could help, but what they really needed were some clever ways to either make work easier or faster. Ancient people
				invented simple machines that would help them overcome forces and allow them to do the desired work against those
				forces.</p>

				<p>The ancient Egyptians, for example, used such inventions to help them build the pyramids. They used levers to pick
				up large blocks of stone. They put those blocks on rollers to move from one area to another. Then they used ramps to
				move the blocks up to the top of the pyramid they were building. The ancient Romans used catapults to throw stones
				at their enemies. The catapult was a large lever. They used a pulley to pull down the arm of the catapult. The device
				was set on wheels, an advanced version of rollers, to move it from place to place.</p>

				<p>We still use simple machines today.</p>

				<p>For example, suppose you stumble upon a large boulder in the middle of a field. There happens to be a large hole in a
				nearby rock fence that the boulder will help to fill. Think about different methods that you might use to move the
				boulder. Does it involve using different tools? Be prepared to share your methods with the class.</p>

					<li>
						<p><span class="first-sentence">In order to lift up a heavy object, such as a huge rock, the lever was invented.</span> A lever is a rigid rod or bar that
						pivots around a fixed point called a fulcrum. When you apply a force on one part of a lever, the lever pivots
						on the fulcrum and another part of the lever moves an object (or person) on the other part of the lever.</p>

						<p>We still use levers today to lift things. For example, a playground seesaw can be used to lift a person. Draw a
						playground seesaw and identify its fulcrum on your drawing. Refer to <strong>Technical Hint: Using the drawing tool</strong>
						to use the Drawing Tool.</p>

						<div class="essay-answer">drawing:</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>There are three different types of levers.</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig13-2.png">
						</figure>

						<ul>
							<li><span class="bold">First class levers</span> are ones in which the fulcrum is placed between the force and the object or load
							you want to move. An example includes scissors. You apply a force by squeezing your hand and the
							load is the paper where the blades are cutting it.</li>

							<li><span class="bold">Second class levers</span> are ones in which the object you want to move is placed between the force and
							the fulcrum. An example includes a nutcracker.</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">5</span></div>

						<p>Which type of lever is the seesaw? How do you know?</p>

						<div class="essay-answer">essay answer:</div>

					</li>

					<li>
						<p>The force sensor is a very interesting device that can be used to measure how simple machines make work
						easier. The force sensor has the ability to measure force either by pushing or pulling on its hook (usually an
						eye bolt). The hook is connected to a rigid beam inside the force sensor that bends a little when you push or
						pull. As you pull on the hook, the beam inside the force sensor bends in the direction you are pulling. The
						electronics inside the sensor convert the amount of bend into a signal sent to the interface where it is
						converted into a number for the software. When you push the hook, the beam bends the other way and the
						signal is reversed. You can tell whether you push or pull on the hook by the sign of the force displayed. One
						will be positive (+) and the other negative (-) on the numeric readout and graph. Try it out. <strong>Refer to Technical
						Hint: Connecting the Vernier force sensor</strong> to connect the force sensor.</p>

						<figure>
							<img src="/contents/teemss2/images/fig13-3.png">
						</figure>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Every sensor affects measurement in some manner. Therefore, the force sensor should always be zeroed
						before you run your experiment in order to remove measurement errors associated with the small forces
						caused by the weight of the hook and the internal beam. Try zeroing your force sensor. Refer to <strong>Technical
						Hint: Zeroing the Force Sensor</strong> to zero the force sensor.</p>

					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Start taking force measurements. Refer to <strong>Technical Hint: Recording a series of measurements</strong> to record a
						series of measurements. Before pushing or pulling on the hook, does the force now read zero? Push and pull
						on the hook to observe the force. Press the stop button to save your results, or clear to try again.</p>

						<p>A pulley system usually acts as a force magnifier. That is, the applied force can be smaller than the load that it lifts. But there's a trade-off: the force sensor must be pulled a longer distance than the load. If the force is less,
						the distance is greater. For example, if the pulley system reduces the force from 400 N to 100 N, you will need
						to pull in 4 m of rope to move the load only 1 m!</p>

						<p>Make sure to think about:</p>

						<p>How does the applied force compare to the weight of the potatoes? Test this idea. Build a pulley system such
						that the force sensor moves 20 cm in order to raise the potatoes 10 cm.</p>

						<p>An inclined plane usually acts as a force magnifier. That is, the applied force is less to pull a load uphill along
						a slope than if the load were lifted straight up. But there's a trade-off: the load must travel a longer distance to
						get to the same height. If the force is less, the distance is greater. For example, the Egyptians used long
						gradual ramps to drag very heavy stones to the tops of the pyramids.</p>
