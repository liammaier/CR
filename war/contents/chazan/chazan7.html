            The ancient mound, or tel, of Jericho is a powerful lure to archaeologists. The famous walls of Jericho, toppled in the biblical book of Joshua, are exactly the type of concrete evidence archaeologists should easily be able to identify and recover. The British archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon sank massive trenches through the tel of Jericho, documenting the stratigraphic sequence and revealing the history of the site. Surprisingly, Kenyon recovered no evidence of a settlement dating to the biblical period. Why these remains are absent is unclear. Perhaps the story of Joshua is more myth than reality. Or maybe the settlement of Jericho described in the book of Joshua was in a different, as yet undiscovered, location.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Kenyon penetrated the deepest archaeological deposits at Jericho, she uncovered a wall and a tower that astounded the archaeological community (see Figure 7.1). These constructions were far older than Joshua; in fact, they were the oldest known monumental architecture ever discovered. The tower and wall at Jericho were built 12,000 years ago, during the Early Neolithic period.
          </p>

          <p>
            The tower of Jericho is only one of a string of discoveries that have shed dramatic light on the origins of agriculture in the Middle East. In this chapter, we examine the shift from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies in the Middle East. The domestication of plants and animals in this region took place within the context of large and dense villages. The adoption of agriculture resulted in a transformation of all aspects of life. These profound changes affected not only social relations between people, but also the way people conceived of the supernatural. In the last section of the chapter, we explore the spread of domesticated plants and animals into Europe.

        <p class="skimmable">
          <span class="first-sentence">The Middle East includes a wide range of climates.</span> A ribbon of Mediterranean climate extends today from Israel and Jordan in the south, up into Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon in the north, and stretches to the east into northern Iraq and western Iran. Together, these regions form an area known as the <b>Fertile Crescent</b>, characterized by dry summers and winter rains with enough precipitation to support vegetation ranging from woodlands to open-park woodlands. Along with trees such as oak and pine, large stands of wild cereals, including wheat, barley, and rye, dot the countryside. To the south and the east of the Fertile Crescent, the Mediterranean open-park woodlands grade into steppe environments that in turn grade into true deserts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The archaeological record clearly shows that the shift to an agricultural way of life in the Middle East was a process rather than a revolution. The transition to agriculture can be traced through a number of stages (see Table 7.1):

Soon after it was abandoned, the encampment at Ohalo was submerged beneath the waters of the Sea of Galilee. Because the deposits were not exposed to air, the preservation of organic remains is extraordinary. A recent period of drought led to an unprecedented lowering of lake levels that exposed the site. Archaeologists were able to open up a horizontal 2,000-square-meter area at Ohalo and unearth the remains of six brush huts that could be traced as shallow oval depressions in the ground between 3 and 4.5 meters in length.

          Burials from the Kebaran and Geometric Kebaran sites are rare.

          surprise (Stock et al. 2005). The individual at Wadi Mataha was a young adult male buried with his face pointed down and his arms and legs "hogtied" behind his back. A stone bowl with the bottom broken out was found with the human remains, as was a long flint blade. The man's skull had been broken open sometime soon after death, leaving a large hole slightly above the forehead.

          Kebaran periods. The burial at Ohalo, located within the camp, would fit with a burial ritual that serves to form a spiritual link between a group and its place of habitation. The situation at Wadi Mataha is quite different, and it is difficult not to see the burial as a violent event. Art objects from either period are rare; the only known examples are two crudely incised pebbles.

The most common mammal bones are gazelles, but the remains of deer, wild pig, wild goat, hare, red fox, and wildcat are also found. From a single hut, nearly 10,000 fish bones, mostly of carp and cichlids, were found. The remains of over 77 species of birds, including grebes, ducks, geese, quail, and birds of prey, were also found at Ohalo.

        We are still far from understanding the causes underlying the innovations found in the Natufian period. It is possible that an increase in population led to an increase in the size and complexity of settlements, but even if this was the case, we are left to question the reasons for an increase in population. Toward the end of the Natufian, coinciding with a period of climatic stress known as the Younger Dryas, there was a reduction in the size and number of Natufian settlements.

The characteristic shape of tools in the Natufian is a crescent-shaped bladelet known as a <b>lunate</b> (Bar-Yosef and Valla 1991). It is assumed that, like the bladelet tools of the preceding periods, lunates served as elements in hunting tools or as parts of tools made up of many small pieces (see Figure 7.5). At the site of Wadi Hammeh in Jordan, a series of bladelets was found mounted in a bone haft of what appears to be a knife or a sickle (Edwards 1991).

          Natufian sites are mortars, pestles, and grooved stones known as shaft straighteners (see Figure 7.6) decorated with a simple meander pattern. In some cases, the tools have been found far from the source of the stone, indicating that they were traded across long distances. Long-distance trade is also indicated by the abundance of Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea shells and shell beads found on Natufian sites, which are often quite distant from the sea.

          <span class="first-sentence">The transition to village life began during the Natufian.</span> Structures consist of undressed stones piled to form walls that are often preserved to a height of up to 1 meter. The structures are oval or open semicircles. The floors of the structures are covered with refuse, including stone tools and debris and animal bones (see Figure 7.7). It is hard to imagine these surfaces being used as houses for families, although it is not clear what other function they might have had. It is usually suggested that the stone walls would have supported a superstructure made of wood and brush.

          Burials are commonly found on Natufian sites, often under the floors of houses.

          <span class="first-sentence">Unfortunately, it has rarely been possible to recover plant remains from Natufian sites.</span> An important exception is the site of <b>Abu Hureyra</b>, located on the Upper Euphrates River in Syria. Abu Hureyra is a site with multiple levels of occupation that span the sequence from the Natufian through the Neolithic. Excavations in the earliest levels at Abu Hureyra uncovered a culture parallel to the Natufian, but with subtle differences. For example, the houses at Abu Hureyra were sunken pits rather than built walls. An ambitious program of flotation for burnt seeds at Abu Hureyra was richly rewarded with a spectacular assemblage of botanical remains. The analysis of the recovered seeds indicates that the people living at Abu Hureyra, like the people at Ohalo, exploited a wide range of plants. Such a broad-spectrum strategy is not surprising, as it is an effective way for hunter-gatherers to minimize the risk that any particular resource will be temporarily scarce. The plant species do not show clear evidence of having been domesticated.
          </p>
          <p>
          With some exceptions, the animal bones found on Natufian sites are dominated by gazelle bones. At Abu Hureyra, 80 percent of the bones identified were from gazelle. At the same time, Natufians continued to hunt a wide range of animals, including wild sheep, goats, and cattle. At sites such as Mallaha, which is located near a marsh, birds were hunted as well.
          </p>
          <p>
          The Natufians did not domesticate any herd animals. (Gazelles have actually never been completely domesticated.) Interestingly, there is evidence that Natufians had domesticated, or at least tamed, dogs. At two sites - Hayonim Terrace and Mallaha - dog skeletons were found buried with human remains (see Figure 7.8). These burials signify that dogs were brought into human society. There is also some indication that the snouts of dogs found on Natufian sites are smaller than the snouts of wild dogs (Dayan 1994). This change in morphology is consistent with the early stages of domestication.

          <span class="first-sentence">For archaeologists, the major marker that distinguishes the Early Neolithic from the Natufian is a gradual shift away from tools made on bladelets to a tool kit made on blades with a particular emphasis on arrowheads (see Figure 7.9).</span> By the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, arrowheads were made on skillfully manufactured blades. Blades are also used for sickles, as is indicated by the frequent presence of sickle polish. Ground stone axes and adzes suit-able for working wood or clearing trees are an important addition to the Early Neolithic tool kit. Grinding stones used for processing grain are also found in extremely large quantities on Early Neolithic sites.

          The use of plaster is highly developed during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period. Manufacturing plaster involves burning large quantities of limestone. Plaster was used to line the floors of houses and for ritual purposes that will be described shortly. In some cases, plaster was used to build simple basins and bowls.

          <span class="first-sentence">During the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A, the size of settlements increased and the first evidence of communal structures appeared.</span> Houses continued to be circular, but settlements were larger than Natufian ones. At the site of <b>Netiv Hagdud</b> in the Jordan Valley, the remains of at least three houses were found in an excavation covering 500 square meters, less than 10 percent of the total area of the settlement (Bar-Yosef et al. 1991). Although population sizes are difficult to estimate, it seems likely that Netiv Hagdud housed somewhere between twenty and thirty families. Beyond the size of the settlement, there are other contrasts between Netiv Hagdud and large Natufian sites such as Mallaha. A rapid accumulation of sediments on Early Neolithic sites points to the extensive use of mud brick architecture. At Netiv Hagdud, there was a buildup of close to 4 meters of sediment over a period of two to three hundred years. The floors of the structures on Early Neolithic sites are well maintained, and debris tends to be concentrated in refuse pits. Storage pits, which are rare on Natufian sites, are common at Netiv Hagdud and other Early Neolithic sites.

          The appearance of communal structures is the most striking aspect of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A. The most spectacular of these structures is the tower discovered in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A levels at Jericho. The 9-meter-high tower is made of undressed stones and mud brick and is attached to the inside of a massive wall. A staircase built inside the tower runs from the base to a hole in the flat platform at the top. The <b>Jericho tower</b> is the earliest known large-scale piece of architecture in the Middle East. Estimates for the time taken to build the tower and the attached wall range between 10,000 and 15,000 working days (Bar-Yosef 1986). Kenyon (1981) interpreted the tower as part of a defensive wall, which she thought ran around the Neolithic village. Because only a small portion of the Neolithic site was excavated, there is no way of knowing whether the bit of wall found attached to the tower does in fact run around the site. In any case, it seems extremely unlikely that the tower could have served a military purpose, as it is built on the inside of the wall. The

          <p>
          interpretation of the tower is made more difficult by the fact that twelve skeletons were found at the base of the staircase. The skeletons were inserted when the stair-case began to collapse. Among the suggestions for the purpose of the tower are (1) that the tower and the wall served for flood protection, and (2) that the entire installation had a cultic function, as its construction and use appear to have been a community effort.
          </p>
          <p>
          Excavations on Pre-Pottery Neolithic A sites in Syria have also uncovered evidence of communal structures. At the site of <b>Jerf el Ahmar</b>, on the Upper Euphrates River in Syria, the excavators found that although the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A houses appear to be located somewhat randomly across the site, there is a sense of community planning, with groups of houses distributed around a central structure (Stordeur 1999). As Figure 7.10 shows, this central structure is larger than the others and is built into the ground rather than on its surface. These semi-subterranean buildings are round, with a large central room surrounded by a series of small cubicles. The excavators suggest that the buildings played a central communal role in the small Early Neolithic village at Jerf el Ahmar. In one case, the skeleton of an individual lying splayed on his back with his head removed was found in the central chamber of a semi-subterranean house. Soon after this person died, the building was destroyed and burnt. The discoveries at Jericho and Jerf el Ahmar indicate that the organization of Pre-Pottery Neolithic A society allowed the community to act as a group. It is intriguing that much of the evidence of community level activity is found in structures with ritual functions associated with evidence of violence. We are left to question the role that ritual and violence played in knitting these early communities together.

          <p>
          During the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period, there was a shift from round houses to rectangular ones and the size of settlements increased significantly. The shift to rectangular houses allowed sites to be more densely packed than they had been in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A. The villages of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B are quite large and often show a high degree of planning. Excavators estimate that in the Early Neolithic levels of Abu Hureyra there were up to 1,440 houses with a population of about 5,000 people (Moore 2000). As seen in Figure 7.11, the houses in the areas excavated were closely packed together and had a regular orientation. There is no evidence that the site was protected by a defensive wall.

          Estimates for the size of Abu Hureyra place it at the high end of Early Neolithic sites in the Middle East. However, sites that could have easily housed hundreds or even thousands of people are common. Excavations at the site of Badja in southern Jordan have shown that houses during the later part of the Early Neolithic were two or even three stories high (Gebel et al. 1997). At Badja, the size of the settlement was limited by its rather precarious setting on cliffs above a deep gully. It appears that people responded to this limitation by crowding their houses closely together and building upwards. Why people chose to live in such an inaccessible setting is an intriguing question.

          During the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, people lived in dense villages where their social life and interactions were constrained within a grid of houses. Life in these villages also required institutional structures to maintain social order. Hunter-gatherer societies, which are highly mobile, can resolve disputes simply by breaking into smaller groups, or "fissioning." The people living in villages like Abu Hureyra would not have had this option. Moreover, life in a densely packed village would have led to inevitable tensions over issues of inheritance and property rights. Discovering how Early Neolithic societies resolved these conflicts is a challenging archaeological problem, but one that is essential to resolve.
          </p>
          <p>
          It is somewhat surprising that there is no real evidence for a social hierarchy in early Neolithic villages. Most houses look more or less the same, as do most burials. There is no sense that the regular layout of the sites reflects the decisions of a central authority.

          <p>
          <span class="first-sentence">Jacques Cauvin has eloquently called the Early Neolithic period the "birth of the gods," and a staggering array of symbolic artifacts has been found on Early Neolithic sites.</span> Ritual objects appear to have operated at many levels, including everyday household objects and objects of display found in sacred precincts or temples. Within both houses and temples there was also a domain of bodies and objects built into walls and buried under floors. It seems clear that as they walked the streets of their villages, these people negotiated not only a world of constructed architecture, but also a world charged with deities, both visible and hidden. The archaeological evidence for Early Neolithic ritual activity can be broken down into three broad categories (based on ideas in Verhoeven 2002 and Naveh 2003): hidden, displayed, and daily life.
          </p>
          <p>
          HIDDEN RITUALS. Many of the ritual objects found on Early Neolithic sites are hidden away in pits or under floors. The most striking hidden objects are <b>plastered skulls</b>. The removal of skulls from human skeletons is found as far back as the Natufian. On Pre-Pottery Neolithic B sites, excavators have discovered skulls on which a plaster face has been modeled. Both plastered and unplastered skulls are found below the floors of houses or in small caches.

          An analysis of one of the skulls from the site of Kefar Hahoresh has provided a particularly detailed picture of the process of creating a plastered skull (Goren et al. 2001). In most cases, the mandible or jawbone was removed before the face was modeled. The first stage was to plug up the recesses in the skull, including the eye sockets and nasal passages. The face was then modeled onto the skull but the

          position of the features was adjusted upwards. Thus, the eyes were built up on the forehead, the nose over the eye sockets, and the mouth over the nasal passage. As a result, the faces of the plastered skulls have an oddly shortened appearance. The analysis of the Kefar Hahoresh skull has shown that the process of modeling a plaster skull took place in several stages and included a range of types of plaster as well as other materials (see Figure 7.13).

          <p>
          Careful stratigraphic analysis has indicated that in some cases plastered skulls were removed from their hiding places below the floors of houses and then carefully redeposited. Some archaeologists argue that this practice was an aspect of ancestor worship and that it was through reverence for the ancestor that Early Neolithic societies maintained cohesion. However, a number of sites appear to challenge this interpretation. At Kefar Hahoresh, much of the excavated area is taken up by a dense deposit of human skeletal remains, hardly consistent with a normal habitation site. The excavator of Kefar Hahoresh has argued that it was a ritual site serving to bring together various communities in the region.

          At the site of Ain Ghazal in Jordan, a collection of plaster figures - one of which is shown in Figure 7.14 - was discovered in two pits (Rollefson 1998). How these figures relate to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B plastered skulls is an enigma. Another puzzling site is a small cave known as Nahal Hemar, located in a remote region south of the Dead Sea (Bar-Yosef 1985). In this cave, a wide range of artifacts was found, such as beads, bone tools, and arrowheads. Due to the dry conditions, textiles, including the remains of a cap and a bag, were recovered, along with a painted stone mask and a skull on which the face was not decorated, but a net pattern had been applied to the cranium. What the function of this collection of artifacts was and, perhaps more importantly, how they got to where they were found are two questions that remain difficult to answer.

          DISPLAY RITUALS. The Pre-Pottery Neolithic A tower of Jericho and the central structure at Jerf el Ahmar were meant to be seen. It seems quite likely that, regardless of their practical functions, these structures also stood as visible symbols of the community. During the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, visibly special buildings are found on a number of sites.
          </p>
          <p>
          At the site of G&#353;bekli Tepe, on the Euphrates River in eastern Turkey, a series of buildings has been found built around monumental t-shaped pillars quarried as a single block from the bedrock. Some of these pillars are carved with either human or animal figures (Schmidt 2001). At the nearby site of Navali ori, a series of large stone sculptures has been uncovered that includes depictions of humans, birds, snakes, and birds combined with humans. Most of these sculptures come from a structure identified as a temple.
          </p>
          <p>
          The majority of the display items found in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B would not have been visible from any great distance. They are thus quite different from the Jericho tower. Many authors have argued that the context for display in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B was within temples or sacred precincts. This is a very important point, because it suggests that access to visible signs of divinity was controlled. Perhaps the elite of Early Neolithic society was a ritual elite.
          </p>
          <p>
          In some cases, there is evidence for the display of skulls, objects that are normally found in hidden contexts. At the site of Cayanu in eastern Turkey, the remains of 450 individuals have been recovered from a single structure known as the skull room, mostly from pits (Schirmer 1990). However, 49 burnt skulls were also found in contexts which suggest that they fell off shelves when the building was burnt.
          </p>
          <p>
          RITUALS OF DAILY LIFE. On several Early Neolithic sites, a large number of simple clay figurines have been found. Although some archaeologists suggest that the statuettes were children's toys, it appears more likely that they had symbolic meaning. These objects are usually found distributed among houses, together with domestic debris.

For agriculturalists, it is desirable to have a plant with a tough rachis so that the seed remains on the plant until it is harvested. A plant with a tough rachis is truly domesticated in that it depends on human intervention for successful reproduction.

          <p>
          Although the discovery at Netiv Hagdud was interpreted at first as evidence of domesticated plants in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A, it now appears that this conclusion is not warranted (Bar-Yosef et al. 1991).Within wild populations of barley, a small percentage of plants have a tough rachis, so the small number of remains of apparently domesticated barley found at Netiv Hagdud could have been collected from wild stands along with a wide range of wild plants.
          </p>
          <p>
          Harvesting of grains did take place during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A, as is attested by botanical remains, grinding stones, and sickles. However, it does not appear that these plants were farmed. The wild forms of plants, including wheat and barley, were harvested, but there is no indication that seeds were stored and planted. In accordance with the criterion developed by Rindos (see page 170), cereals exploited during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A were not domesticated, in the sense that the plants did not depend on their relationship with humans for protection or reproduction. There is no evidence of domesticated animals other than dogs during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A. Gazelles remained the main species hunted, together with a wide range of other animals, including fish and birds.
          </p>
          <p>
          A series of dried figs recovered from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A site of Gilgal, located in the Jordan Valley near Netiv Hagdud, provides the earliest compelling evidence of plant domestication in the Middle East (Kislev et al. 2006). Figure 7.16 shows a scanning electron microscope photo of one of the figs. These figs, like modern domesticated ones, are not capable of reproduction without human intervention. Although this intervention is simple, involving merely the cutting and planting of branches, it clearly meets the definition of domestication.
          </p>

          <p>
          Farming developed across the Middle East during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B. A wide range of domesticated crops is found, including cereals (emmer wheat, einkorn wheat, and barley), pulses (lentil and pea), and legumes (bitter vetch and chick pea). The domesticated grains show an increase in the size of individual grains and a shift to a tough rachis.
          </p>
          <p>
          Animal domestication developed somewhat later than plant domestication. The later part of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B shows evidence of the domestication of sheep and goats. Sheep were domesticated in the northern mountainous regions of Turkey, Iraq, or Iran, their natural habitation zone. Establishing the location and timing for the domestication of goats is quite complex, as wild goats are found across the entire region of the Middle East. By the end of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, pigs and cattle were domesticated. The evidence for domesticated animals in this phase includes a reduction in animal sizes, an overrepresentation of the bones of young males, and the discovery of animals such as sheep outside of their natural range. The domestication of sheep and goats appears to have followed a falloff in gazelle populations.
