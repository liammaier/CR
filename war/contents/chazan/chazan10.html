				Easter Island is a speck of land thousands of miles from any other inhabited island. The monumental stone heads known as Moai that dot the island embody the enigma which is at the heart of this chapter (see Figure 10.1). Easter Island has never had large cities or even large populations. The island has no particular material wealth, and its inhabitants were not in contact with any of its neighbors until Europeans reached there in 1722. So how - and perhaps more importantly, why - did the people of Easter Island construct these massive monuments? What motivated them to quarry the rock laboriously, drag the massive stones across the island, and set them up on elaborate platforms? Archaeological research on Easter Island has gone a long way toward providing an answer to these questions. Competing leaders erected the Moai during periods of prosperity. Competition between chiefs fueled a cycle of construction of monuments. Some archaeologists argue that in the fragile island ecology of Easter Island this competitive cycle had disastrous consequences, resulting in deforestation and the decimation of resources (Flenley and Bahn 2003). During the subsequent period of ecological distress, the construction of Moai ceased and appears to have been replaced by increased levels of violence.

				Societies that have developed a degree of political complexity but lack a fully developed state bureaucracy often produce archaeological sites that strike us as enigmatic or even mysterious. These sites are frequently characterized by elaborate and well-planned construction yet yield little evidence of a ruling elite. In this chapter, we examine the archaeological record of Stonehenge, Chaco Canyon, and Pueblo Bonito. All of these sites are the ruins of structures built by societies that Fried would define as ranked or stratified and Service would describe as chiefdoms. None produce evidence of the centralized bureaucracy that characterizes the state. In this chapter we explore these spectacular sites in order to gain insight into the social life of pre-state complex societies.

			The construction of Stonehenge has been variously attributed to Romans, Druids, Danes, and Greeks (Castleden 1993). For some, Stonehenge is the product of mystical forces or "earth mysteries" (Chippindale et al. 1999). Archaeological research has demonstrated that Stonehenge is not a single monument, but rather the site of a sequence of monuments built over a period of more than 1,000 years. Research on the region surrounding Stonehenge has documented an entire landscape upon which monuments were constructed. As a result, Stonehenge can now be grounded

				<h3>The Development of Stonehenge</h3>
				<p>
				<span class="first-sentence">Archaeological research at Stonehenge has demonstrated that the site developed through a series of stages beginning in the Late Neolithic (5,000 years ago) and ending in the Early Bronze Age (3,500 years ago)</span> (Souden 1997; Cleal et al. 1995). Understanding Stonehenge requires an understanding of the long process through which the site came into being.Figure 10.3 on the next page illustrates the major stages of construction of Stonehenge.
				</p>
				<p>
				<strong>PHASE 1: THE EARTHWORK CIRCLE.</strong> The first monument at Stonehenge was a round ditch excavated to enclose an area 110 meters in diameter. Slight embankments were built up on both the inside and outside of the ditch. Wooden posts were erected in a ring of holes known as the Aubrey holes, which were dug along the inside of the ditch. Animal bones, including a cattle jaw and an ox skull dating to Phase 1, were found buried in the ditch. Phase 1 dates to the Late Neolithic, roughly 5,000 years ago.
				</p>
				<p>
				<strong>PHASE 2: BURIALS AND A TIMBER STRUCTURE.</strong> During Phase 2, the ditch and the Aubrey holes were largely filled in. Human remains dating to Phase 2, including remains from cremated burials, are found in the fill of both the ditch and some of the Aubrey holes. A structure of standing timber posts was constructed near the center of the monument. Phase 2 dates to the Late Neolithic, between 5,000 and 4,500 years ago. The recent reappraisal of the site (Parker Pearson et al. 2009) suggests that most of the burials actually date to Phase 1.

				<p>
				<strong>PHASE 3: STONE MONUMENT.</strong> The monumental standing stones that are the most impressive aspect of Stonehenge were erected in a series of six subphases during the Early Bronze Age between 4,500 and 3,500 years ago.
				</p>
				<p>
				<strong>Phase 3a: The Bluestones.</strong> The <strong>bluestones</strong>, shown in Figure 10.4, were set up in either a circular or semicircular formation at the center of the monument in a series of holes known as the Q and R holes. The bluestones, which stand between 2 and 2.5 meters high, are not the most impressive stones at the site, but they do raise many questions. The geological source of these stones is not in the vicinity of

				Stonehenge; it lies in the Preseli Mountains in Wales, over 240 kilometers away. Moving these stones from Wales to the Salisbury Plain would have required an enormous effort. Some archaeologists have argued that the bluestones had been transported to southern England by glacial activity during the Pleistocene. How-ever, it remains possible that the stones were transported from Wales as part of the construction of Stonehenge. Why these particular stones would have had a value to justify such an effort remains an open question. Recent research suggests that the bluestones might have been brought to Stonehenge as early as the first construction phase (Parker Pearson et al. 2009).

				<p>
				<strong>Phase 3b: Sarsen Circle and Trilithons.</strong> The <strong>Sarsen Circle</strong>, constructed of massive blocks, was set up in the central area of the site. The blocks were of sarsen stone, a very hard sandstone found 30 kilometers from Stonehenge. In a staggering triumph of engineering, the circle of sarsen stones was capped by lintels made of solid blocks. These lintels and their supporting stones were fit together with carved joints. Inside the Sarsen Circle, another set of sarsen monoliths known as the <strong>trilithons</strong> were set up in a horseshoe arrangement oriented toward the northeast. The trilithons were set up in five pairs, each capped by a lintel. The trilithons are truly massive, reaching a maximum height of 7 meters.
				</p>
				<p>
				<strong>Phases 3c-f: Rearranging Bluestones and Digging Holes.</strong> The construction of the Sarsen Circle and the trilithons was the most intensive phase at Stonehenge. There followed a series of three phases in which the bluestones were reorganized and a series of holes was dug in concentric circles around the site. In the final configuration, one set of bluestones was set up in the shape of a horseshoe on the inside of the trilithons and another was erected between the trilithons and the Sarsen Circle. Two concentric rings of pits were excavated around the outside of the monument.

				<span class="first-sentence">Stonehenge was not an isolated monument. Numerous different types of earthen mounds and enclosures were built on the Salisbury Plain during the Late Neolithic and the Early Bronze Age (see Figure 10.5).</span> One of the most impressive features is the Avenue, a path bounded by ditches and embankments that runs for over a kilometer between the Avon river and Stonehenge. Although the function of the Avenue appears to have been to guide people towards Stonehenge, other features on the site have a less clear purpose. The most massive of these is the Cursus, a slightly raised earthen platform that runs for almost 3 kilometers in an east - west alignment. The entire landscape of the Salisbury Plain was sculpted by these massive earthen constructions (Thomas 1991). New excavations at the Cursus have shown that this feature might actually predate the first phase of construction at Stonehenge (Thomas et al. 2009).

				<h3>The Context of Stonehenge</h3>
				<p>
				<span class="first-sentence">Stone monuments constructed during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age are found in many parts of western Europe.</span> However, even within this context, Stonehenge stands out as a marvel of engineering and a true enigma. What was its function within the lives of the people who built it? Many have argued that the monument is aligned to allow for the prediction of celestial events. It seems beyond question that it was a construction of religious significance. Almost no domestic remains have been discovered during excavations at the site. Moreover, in the region as a whole, domestic remains are limited to small pits with artifacts and refuse and the faint traces of houses built of wooden posts (Hunter and Ralston 1999).The people who built Stonehenge were agriculturalists who raised wheat and grazed cattle. There is botanical evidence that in the Late Neolithic the Salisbury Plain became an increasingly open landscape used mostly for grazing. Recent excavations at the site of <strong>Durrington Walls</strong>, located 2.8 kilometers from Stonehenge, have revealed the exciting discovery of a series of houses that appear to be part of a village dating to the Late Neolithic (Parker Pearson et al. 2005).
				</p>
				<p>
				The construction of Stonehenge required the ability to organize a large group of people for work beyond their basic subsistence activities. This labor force had to be coordinated and guided by clear planning. The accomplishment of transporting and erecting the 7-meter-high trilithons and then capping them with a lintel stone is quite impressive. These feats of engineering and organization were achieved by people who did not live under a state bureaucracy. The leaders who directed these projects are invisible to us today. Their authority would have rested not on an absolute control based on force, but rather on the "soft power" that comes from the redistribution of surplus goods and the status that comes from holding an inherited position in society.
				</p>
				<p>
				Colin Renfrew (1984) has argued that Stonehenge was built by people living in chiefdoms and that the increasing scale of the monument over time reflects the increasing size of territories controlled by a single chief. Renfrew recognizes that a critical weakness in his argument is the absence of "direct evidence among the artifacts found for personal ranking, as indicated by distinctive dress, ornament, or possessions" (Renfrew 1984, 243). However, in 2002, archaeologists working on a rescue excavation before a housing development was to be constructed found a pair of burials that fulfill Renfrew's prediction: The people who built Stonehenge did include elites marked by ornaments and possessions.

				<p>
				The <strong>Amesbury Archer</strong>, as the main burial came to be known, was found 3 miles from Stonehenge (see Figure 10.6). He lived during the Early Bronze Age, corresponding to Phase 3 in the construction of Stonehenge. A recent program of radiocarbon dating indicates that the Amesbury Archer lived during Phase 3c-f, after the Sarsen Circle and trilithons had been erected (Parker Pearson et al. 2007). Objects found with the burial include two slate wrist-guards, a bone pin, two copper knives, five pots, boar tusks, a cache of flints, arrowheads, a shale belt ring, and two gold earrings. No other burial with a similar wealth of grave goods has been discovered from this period. Nearby, a second burial was found of an individual with more modest grave goods that include gold earrings. The goods found with these two burials are precisely the kind of display items that Renfrew would expect in the burials of the leaders of a chiefdom. However, the Amesbury Archer also raises questions. Isotopic analyses of the skeletal remains indicate that the Archer grew up, not in the vicinity of Stonehenge, but rather far off in the Alps. Why did he move such a long distance? How did he gain status in a society he was not born into?

				<span class="first-sentence">It might seem that there must be an explanation for Stonehenge, that it is a mystery waiting to be unlocked. There is no lack of explanations for the monument; they range from the construction of a "prehistoric observatory" to fantasies of a Druid sanctuary</span> (Chippendale et al. 1990). Certainly, there is some truth behind these ideas: Stonehenge must have had a ritual function, and many aspects of the arrangement of the standing stones correspond to celestial orientations. However, Barbara Bender (1992) has criticized such explanations as attempts to "freeze" the past that lack a sense of an ongoing historical process. Bender's critique is particularly relevant to the site of Stonehenge, a monument that came into being as part of a process lasting over 1,500 years. According to Julian Thomas, "Stonehenge never had a meaning" (Thomas 1996, 62). Over more than 80 generations, Stonehenge became the land-scape within which people lived. The essential explanation of the monument is that it does not have a single explanation; rather, it must be understood as the long-term unfolding of a society's relationship to the landscape.
				</p>

				<p>
				But can we say <i>anything</i> about what Stonehenge meant? Determining the meaning of ancient monuments is treacherous terrain, since we are essentially trying to gain insight into prehistoric beliefs. Ian Hodder has placed Stonehenge within the broader context of monument building in the Neolithic of western Europe. He sees the emergence of large monuments as part of the expansion of the household to include a larger group of people spread over a wider area. For Hodder (1990), Stonehenge is one of many monuments that recreate the household at the level of a regional landscape. Bender (1992) takes a somewhat different approach, seeing the scale of construction at Stonehenge and the surrounding area producing a fusion of nature and culture. Over the generations, the constructions at Stonehenge became elements of a developing landscape, where the lines be-tween nature and culture were blurred. One intriguing idea is that, for Stonehenge and the surrounding earthworks, such as the Avenue, the act of producing and experiencing the landscape was as important as the enduring monument. Bender points to the digging and refilling of holes and the way the earthworks would have channeled peoples' movements. She also suggests that the shaping of the landscape might have expressed and strengthened conceptions of gender and power in society.
				</p>
				<p>
				Mike Parker Pearson and Ramilisonina (1998) have developed an interpretation of Stonehenge that builds on recent research at the site of Durrington Walls (see Figure 10.7 on the next page). Like Stonehenge, Durrington Walls sits on the Avon River, but in every other respect these sites are opposites. At Durrington Walls there is evidence of occupation, including houses, while at Stonehenge no domestic debris has been recovered. Durrington Walls has three monumental circles, but these were built of timber rather than standing stones. Radiocarbon dating now shows that Durrington Walls and Phase 3b at Stonehenge, the period of the construction of the trilithons and Sarsen Circle, are contemporary. Parker Pearson and Ramilisonina have suggested a connection between the two sites, saying that Durrington Walls was the land of the living while Stonehenge was the domain of the ancestors. At Stonehenge, the wood circle at Durrington Walls was transformed into stone, a material that represented the builders' ancestors. If Parker Pearson and Ramilisonina's

				<p>
				interpretation is correct, it might explain why the builders of the Sarsen Circle used mortise and tenon as well as tongue-and-groove joints to fit the lintels onto the up-right stones. These are techniques used in woodworking and their use at Stonehenge is puzzling. Perhaps the explanation of this feature is symbolic rather than technological - perhaps Stonehenge was built as a stone replica of a wooden structure. Parker Pearson and Ramilisonina believe that Stonehenge would have stood empty after its construction, that "its inhabitants were the spirits of the ancestors" (Parker Pearson and Ramilisonina 1998, 319).
				</p>

				<h3>Summing Up the Evidence</h3>
				<p>
				Archaeological research has demonstrated that Stonehenge came into being over a period of more than 1,500 years. It is therefore very unlikely that the site has a single meaning or explanation. The source of power underlying the construction of the site did not rest on control based on force, as is often found in state societies. The Amesbury Archer provides the first direct evidence of the elites of Early Bronze Age society in the region. Although the cultural context of Stonehenge remains enigmatic, the new excavations at Durrington Walls have opened up a promising new line of research on the cultural landscape of Stonehenge.

			The current environment of Chaco Canyon "does not exactly correspond to most people's concept of Eden" (Sebastian 1992, 9). Chaco Canyon covers an area 30 kilometers long and between 0.5 and 1 kilometer wide and is between 90 and 180 meters deep. Rainfall, vegetation, surface water, and game are all sparse (see Figure 10.9). The inhabitants of the canyon responded to this challenging environment by developing dams and canals to control runoff water from torrential summer rains.

				Archaeological research at Pueblo Bonito has demonstrated that the massive Great House was built up over centuries (Windes 2003). The excellent preservation of wooden beams in the dry environment of Chaco Canyon has allowed archaeologists to use dendrochronology, or treering dating, to develop a tight sequence of events. The construction of Pueblo Bonito began around 1,200 years ago (A.D. 800) and the complex reached its full size over the next 200 and 300 years (A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1100). Subsequently, there was a reduction in the extent of occupation, and building activity slowed before the site was abandoned about 750 years ago (A.D. 1250).

				<h3>The Function of Pueblo Bonito</h3>
				<p>
				<span class="first-sentence">Archaeologists working at Pueblo Bonito have struggled to determine the function of this impressive site</span> (Neitzel 2003). The construction of a complex of hundreds of rooms suggests that the site was a very large settlement and population estimates for the site have ranged as high as 1,200 people. However, excavations have uncovered a surprisingly small number of fireplaces and few remains of domestic activities. These observations, along with the layout of the site and the large number of kivas, have led some to argue that Pueblo Bonito was essentially a ceremonial center and that it rarely had a population of much more than 100.
				</p>

				Two large mounds of cultural debris and earth reaching 6 meters in height and located in front of the plaza are an important source of information on the function of Pueblo Bonito (Cameron 2002). Similar mounds, known as berms, are a common feature of Great Houses from the Chaco period. A unique feature of the Pueblo Bonito berms is that they were plastered, so they could have served as a platform for ceremonies. Excavation of the berms here and at other sites has produced massive quantities of ceramics. The types of vessels found suggest that they are the refuse of ceremonial feasting rather than of normal daily activities.
				</p>
				<p>
				The function of Pueblo Bonito might have changed over time (Neitzel 2003). Its initial occupation conforms to the size and organization of a residential site. It is possible that between A.D. 800 and A.D. 1000 it was the residence of an elite group. With the expansion around A.D. 1000, the focus of the site shifted toward ceremonial function. Of course, it is possible that throughout its occupation Pueblo Bonito served as both an elite residence and a ceremonial center; it appears that at A.D. 1000, the balance of activity shifted toward the ceremonial aspect. The connection between an elite residence and a ceremonial center indicates that the elite's power was at least partly the result of their special role in religious ceremonies.

				<span class="first-sentence">The sheer scale of the construction at Pueblo Bonito suggests some form of political leadership.</span> To get a sense of the size of the undertaking, consider that over 200,000 trees were used to make the floors and roofs of the Great House. One estimate places the amount of labor involved in its construction at 800,000 person hours (Metcalf 2003).
				</p>
				<p>
				Archaeological evidence for social inequality at Pueblo Bonito is restricted largely to the finds made in two small rooms at the north end. Although a number of rooms at the site included burial remains, those at Room 33 are unique (Akins 2003). Here, the disarticulated remains of sixteen individuals were found above a wooden plank floor. Below the floor, two male burials were found together with lavish offerings. Altogether, the burial offerings found in Room 33 included over 50,000 pieces of turquoise in the form of beads, pendants, and mosaic inlays. Such a concentration of turquoise is unknown in any contemporary context. Not far away, in Room 38, a rich deposit of beads, pendants, and mosaic pieces made of jet, a hard black stone, was discovered (see Figure 10.12). Although no human burials were found in Room 38, it also contained fourteen skeletons of macaws, colorful birds native to the Gulf Coast of Mexico.

				<p>
				The discoveries in Rooms 33 and 38 at Pueblo Bonito make it clear that wealth was not equally distributed among members of society. It is interesting that turquoise, jet, and macaws were traded over very long distances. The concentration of large quantities of these objects in two rooms suggests that the elite of Pueblo Bonito society exercised some degree of control over trade networks.

				<span class="first-sentence">The large number of trade items found in Rooms 33 and 38 at Pueblo Bonito indicate that the site was part of a larger network. Within Chaco Canyon, archaeologists have identified a system of roads connecting the Great Houses. </span>Research using satellite imagery has provided clear evidence that the system of roads stretched far beyond the limits of the canyon www.ghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/archeology/chaco.html). A series of photographs taken by NASA with a Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS) detected over 200 miles of roads radiating out from Chaco Canyon.
				</p>
				<p>
				The road system links Chaco Canyon with sites covering a large part of what is today the Four Corners region of the American Southwest. Sites in this region tend to share similarities in architecture which, together with the road system, suggest that they were linked into what has been called the <strong>Chacoan Network</strong>. Although Chaco Canyon was clearly the center of this network, there is no evidence that the people living there had control over the outlying settlements. However, more than just high-status trade items such as turquoise, jet, and macaws flowed into the Great Houses at Chaco. It has long been recognized that much of the pottery recovered at Chaco Canyon was not produced locally, but was brought to the site from outlying areas in the Chacoan Network. A study of maize kernels suggests that some of the food consumed at Chaco Canyon was not grown locally. By looking at the isotopes of the element strontium in maize kernels found at Chaco Canyon, researchers have shown that at least some of the maize was grown in areas over 80 kilometers away (Benson et al. 2003).
				</p>
				<p>
				The riddle of the Chacoan Network is, What made it run? What compelled people to bring food and pottery into Chaco Canyon from surrounding areas? What gave the people living at Pueblo Bonito the ability to control large quantities of high-status trade items? One possibility is that these items were brought to Chaco Canyon as taxes collected by a central authority backed by the threat of force. The problem with such a scenario is that there is no evidence of such an authority or even of very large populations in Chaco Canyon. Another possibility is that the power of the people living at Chaco Canyon was the result of the centrality of the canyon in the ritual and religious life of the people living within the greater Chacoan Network. The flow of goods into Chaco Canyon might have been the result of cycles of ceremonial feasting in which large groups of people congregated in the canyon for very brief periods, bringing from their homes food and utensils that were then discarded in the refuse piles such as the berm in front of Pueblo Bonito.

				<h3>The Rise and Fall of Chaco Canyon</h3>

				<p>
				<span class="first-sentence">The location of the elaborate structures like Pueblo Bonito in the highly arid environment of Chaco Canyon has led archaeologists to look for a connection between fluctuations in climate and the rise and fall of the Great Houses. </span> The relationship between climate and the end of the occupation of these houses is clear and direct (Sebastian 1992). A devastating drought beginning in A.D. 1130 made continuing intensive occupation untenable. As a result, construction of the Great Houses came to an end and occupation was abandoned. By the time the drought had ended, the Chacoan Network had collapsed and Chaco Canyon never regained its central role.
				</p>
				<p>
				The link between climate and the rise of Chaco Canyon is more complex than the connection between climate and the end of its occupation. A number of archaeologists have suggested that the Chacoan Network developed as a means of buffering risk in an uncertain environment. Given the low rainfall in the region around Chaco Canyon, there was always a risk of local crop failure. If each group lived in isolation,
				</p>
				
				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">269</div>

				<p>
				then crop failure would lead to starvation. However, if groups were linked through a network in which exchange regularly took place, any group that experienced a failure of its crops could trade for food with other members of the network whose crops had not failed. The existence of a network for the redistribution of food and other goods thus acted as a buffer between the uncertain environment and local communities.
				</p>
				<p>
				Lynne Sebastian (1992) has argued that this explanation for the rise of Chaco Canyon is wrong. She points out that the Great Houses were built during a period with relatively high rainfall. Why would a buffering mechanism develop when climate
				</p>

				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">270</div>

				<p>
				pressures were reduced? As an alternative, Sebastian suggests that, during the periods beginning around A.D. 1000, there was an increase in annual rainfall, which allowed for an agricultural surplus. The accumulation of surpluses in the hands of local elites led to a cycle of competition. The elaborate construction at Pueblo Bonito and the concentration of rare trade goods such as turquoise and jet are expressions of this competition. For Sebastian, it is the existence of an agricultural surplus, rather than the threat of agricultural failure, that led to the spectacular developments in Chaco Canyon.
				</p>

				<h3>Summing Up the Evidence</h3>
				<p>
				The Great Houses of Chaco Canyon were the hub of an extensive Chacoan Network. Whether this network was a buffer against stress or the result of surplus production remains the subject of debate. Excavations at Pueblo Bonito have demonstrated that there was a considerable concentration of wealth in the hands of an elite. This wealth included trade goods drawn from a very large area. At the same time, excavations indicate that the Great Houses were not densely settled towns, but rather ceremonial centers that were probably permanently occupied only by a small group. Given the effort expended in the construction of the Great Houses, the concentration of wealth in burials, and the evidence for the influx of goods to Chaco Canyon from the Chacoan Network, it is clear that the leaders of this society were extremely powerful. However, there is no evidence that their power rested on the monopolization of force. One possibility is that the power of the leaders flowed from the centrality of Chaco Canyon in ritual and ceremony.

The critical question is whether the elites had control based on the use of force or whether they managed society by other means, such as religious authority or the organization of ceremonies and feasting. The enigma of Stonehenge and Pueblo Bonito is a not only a question of engineering, but also one of social organization. One ultimately asks how and why a group of people came together to create these structures. In each case, this is a question that will continue to motivate archaeological research well into the future.</p>
