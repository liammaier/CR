				<h2>Introduction: Definitions of Agriculture</h2>
				
				<p class="skimmable">In the modern world, institutionalized power is a basic fact of life. With the exception of a small number of disputed territories, the deep oceans, and Antarctica, the entire globe is carved up into sovereign entities which a central government holds authority. The way this authority is exercised and its limits vary considerably; however, the existence of centralized authority is a global phenomenon that shapes the world we live in (Figure IV 1).</p>
				
				<p>Centralized government or authority is a relatively recent development in human society. Gaining an understanding of how these institutions came into being is one of the central themes of archaeological research. Through much of the early history of archaeology, the origin of central authority was couched within the broader framework of the progress of humanity. Lewis Henry Morgan and V Gordon Childe considered what was often called the origin of civilization to have been the inevitable next step in the upward movement of humanity following on the origins of agriculture. From such a perspective, the source of central authority explains itself: People would naturally aspire to live within more advanced and highly developed societies.</p>

				<p>Today, most archaeologists have a more subtle understanding of the development of politically complex human societies. Although it is recognized that centralized authority was essential in order for people to live in big urban centers and for significant developments to occur in culture and technology, there is also a clear sense of the costs of such authority. Political complexity is inevitably linked with increased social inequality and limitations on personal autonomy. While early archaeologists might have questioned what allowed societies to &#8220;advance&#8221; to civilization, archaeologists today are more likely to ask about the forces that pushed societies toward increasing social inequality. The critical issue underlying much contemporary research is how centralized authority gained legitimacy. An authority has <b>legitimacy</b> when its right to power is accepted. One question is, To what degree was the legitimacy of authority the result of consensus or coercion? In a system grounded in consensus, members of society believe in the rights of the centralized authority; in a system based on coercion, people are forced to accept this authority. In most cases, legitimacy is the result of a combination of consensus and coercion.</p>

				<h3>Categorizing Political Complexity</h3>
				
				<p>A number of anthropologists have developed schemes for categorizing the types of social organization found in societies around the world. These schemes provide an essential framework for guiding research endeavors dealing with the development of political complexity. The goal of such schemes is not to encompass the tremendous variation that characterizes human societies, but rather to provide a model of commonalities in the way that political complexity develops.</p>
				
				<figure class="aside">

						<b>egalitarian society</b> A society in which the only differences in status are based on skill, age, and gender.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Morton H. Fried (1967) defined lour types of societies: egalitarian, ranked, stratified, and state. In <b>egalitarian societies</b>, the only differences in status between members are based on their skill at subsistence activities (such as hunting), their age, and their gender. A person's status is determined by a combination of these factors. Production in egalitarian societies takes place within households, with each one carrying out more or less the same tasks. Exchange tends to be casual and based on reciprocity.</p>
				
				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">248</div>
				
				<p>In an egalitarian society, there are as many positions of prestige as there are people to fill them. In a ranked society, there are fewer positions of prestige than there are people to fill them, and there is a hierarchy of prestige that is not linked to age, gender, or ability. The basis for prestige is often a simple attribute, such as birth order. In such a society, the firstborn son might have higher prestige than his siblings. Although there is a hierarchy in a ranked society, there is no real political power or exploitation. The role of a person occupying a high&#45;status position is to collect, not to expropriate; to redistribute, rather than consume.</p>
				
				<p>In ranked societies, there are individuals with high prestige but little real power. These &#8220;big men&#8221; or &#8220;chiefs&#8221; serve as the focal point of a system of collecting and redistributing resources, but they do not expropriate or consume more than their neighbors who have lower prestige. By contrast, in a stratified society, all people do not have equal access to key resources; rather, access is tightly linked to prestige: People of high prestige have unimpeded access to these resources, while people of low prestige encounter impediments. In stratified societies, as in ranked societies, the number of high-prestige positions is limited on the basis of criteria other than age, gender, and ability. Because of the unequal access to key resources, including food and shelter, stratified societies are characterized by a growth of exploitation, which can take the form of demands on labor, institutional slavery, or more complex systems based on a division of labor among groups of specialists. Organization is based, not only on the household and kin group, but also on communities of people drawn from different households and kin groups.</p>
				
				<p>Fried defined states as societies in which power is organized on a supra-kin basis (Fried 1967) . The essential task of the state is to use its power to maintain the social hierarchy that has escaped from its grounding in the kin group. Characteristics of state societies include population control through the fixing of boundaries, the development of a legal system, the maintenance of military and police forces, taxation, and conscription. For Fried, the evolution of political complexity is a gradual process in which the basic unit of organization shifts from the family and kin group to large &#8220;supra&#45;kin&#8221; communities. This process also sees increasing control of access to key resources and an increase in centralized political power.</p>

						<br />
						<b>urban society</b> A society in which people live in large cities. V. Gordon Childe developed ten criteria defining an urban society<br />
						<br />
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				
				<p>A similar scheme developed by Elman Service (1971) divides societies into bands, tribes, chiefdoms, and states. Service's definition of band and tribe societies corresponds roughly to Fried's egalitarian and ranked societies. For Service, chiefdoms are societies characterized by an intermediate level of social complexity, where centralized leadership is based on heredity. However, leaders in these societies have little ability to use force to maintain order, relying on religious authority as their source of power (Service 1975). State societies are sharply different from chiefdoms in that government and law are backed by force. Service summarizes his view of the state as a society integrated by a bureaucracy that uses force (Service 1971, 167).The state has a legitimate monopoly over the use of force. This does not mean that state societies are inherently violent. Rather, it is through the monopolization and controlled use of force that the rulers of state societies are able to maintain peaceful order among a large population. The role of force is to allow the bureaucratic elite to integrate society.</p>
				
				<p>Both Fried and Service see the development of political complexity as the movement of authority from the kin group to a government that is not based on kinship. Fried tends to emphasize the emergence of inequality as high status becomes increasingly concentrated in the hands of a smaller number of people (see Figure IV.2 for an example of the way that high status can be indicated). Service highlights the emergence in state societies of a control over the legitimate use of force.</p>

				<h3>Defining Cities</h3>
				
				<p>V. Gordon Childe chose to sidestep the search for the early state by shifting the emphasis from political institutions to the cities that characterize urban society. In the modern world, urban centers are characterized by high population density as well as a high degree of planning (Figure IV3). Childe developed ten criteria that archaeologists could use to identify urban societies in the archaeological record: urban centers, surplus production and storage, taxes to a deity or king, monumental architecture, a ruling class, writing systems, exact and predictive sciences, sophisticated art styles, foreign trade, and specialist craftsmen. In the same way that he saw the origins of agriculture as the Neolithic Revolution, Childe saw the development of state societies as the Urban Revolution. Once again, all aspects of human life were transformed by interlocking changes in economy and society.</p>
				
				<p>The advantage of Childe&#39;s list of criteria is that they are likely to leave visible traces in the archaeological record. However, a number of these criteria are poorly defined. For example, how big does a settlement have to be to count as an urban center? Furthermore, Childe did not make it clear why these criteria are relevant, other than the fact that they are archaeologically visible. One solution to this problem is to define the urban center in terms of its place in a regional settlement system. Henry Wright and Gregory Johnson (1975) have emphasized that, in urban societies, there is a hierarchy with at least three different levels of settlement size. This hierarchy is significant because it reflects a differentiated administrative structure. In a clever turn of phrase, Norman Coffee (2005) points out that the birth of the city was also the origin of the countryside. The movement of people and power into cities inevitably restructured the lives of people living in towns and villages.</p>

				<h3>A Comparative Approach to State Formation</h3>
				
				<p>Inequality is an essential element of all human societies. Even in those societies which Fried describes as egalitarian, there are differences in status based on skill, age, and gender. The categories developed by Fried and Service are useful tools, but they should not trick us into believing that the emergence of inequality followed a single trajectory in all societies. For example, the societies of the northwest coast of North America offer a fundamental challenge to our expectation that the emergence of political complexity builds on the economy of a village farming way of life. The societies of the northwest coast</p>

				<p>were complex hunter-gatherers with a subsistence base that included a broad range of marine and terrestrial resources, lived in villages (see Figure IV.4) and had a complex social hierarchy that included the institution of slavery. Perhaps any attempt to shoehorn societies into a category such as a chiefdom or a state is misguided. One could argue that it would be better to study social complexity as a continuum or, alternatively, to focus on the internal logic of each individual society.</p>
				
				<p>There certainly is danger to taking a comparatively approach to the emergence of political complexity. While recognizing these dangers, Bruce Trigger has written an eloquent defense of comparative studies. Trigger writes, &#8220;The most important issue confronting the social sciences is the extent to which human behavior is shaped by factors that operate cross-culturally as opposed to factors that are unique to particular cultures .... Given the biological similarities and the cultural diversity of human beings, how differently are they likely to behave under analogous circumstances? The answer to this question is crucial to understanding human behavior and cultural change and shaping the future course of human development&#8221; (Trigger 2003, 3). Adopting a comparative approach allows archaeologists to explore the regularities associated with the formation of states, regardless of the context in which that formation occurs, and at the same time to appreciate the unique features of the process in particular regions.</p>
				
				<p>State societies can be divided into primary states, which form without external influence from neighboring state societies, and secondary states, which form under the influence of neighboring state societies. As with the origins of agriculture, the transition to state societies is a process that took place independently in a number of regions. Increasingly, archaeologists are paying close attention not only to the processes leading to the formation of states, but also to those that cause them to collapse (Diamond 2005).</p>
				
				<p>In some cases, states began aggressive campaigns of expansion, resulting in the formation of empires (Adcock et al. 2001). <b>Empires</b> are political entities that bring together a diverse and heterogeneous group of societies under a single ruler. Often, empires rely on the brutality of military power to achieve domination. This power is typically depicted in the culture of the temples of the Assyrians (Figure IV.5), who expanded out of Mesopotamia to control a large part of the Middle East. Empires also require the development of methods of communication to allow for the rapid transformation of information. Communication enables the core of the empire to control vents far from the center. The inequality between a core region and peripheral ones is characteristic of empires. The flow of goods and resources moves from the periphery to the core, usually in the form of tribute.</p>

				<p>The archaeology of empire requires research covering an immense geographic area. One of the most interesting aspects of this study is exploring how the core maintained control and domination over the periphery. Archaeologists must look at sites at the core and at the periphery, while paying attention to the two linchpins of the empire: communication and force. Excavations and surveys of roads and military camps are a common part of the archaeology of empires.</p>

				<h3>Ecology and Society</h3>
				
				<p>Karl Wittfogel proposed a theory of early state formation that emphasized the importance of large&#45;scale irrigation processes. Wittfogel (1957) argued that the need to organize large groups of workers to build and maintain irrigation canals allowed the formation of a hierarchical form of government he labeled &#8220;oriental despotism.&#8221; </p>
				
				<p>Wittfogel&#39;s model is an example of a prime&#45;mover model&#8211;one in which a single factor is seen as the cause of a phenomenon. In this case, the organization of large scale agriculture leads to the formation of a centralized bureaucratic government. Robert Carneiro (1970) has proposed a model of state formation that considers the interaction among geography, population increase, and violence. Carneiro emphasizes that early state societies tend to develop in circumscribed areas-that is, areas surrounded by natural barriers or frontiers with neighboring groups. A population increase in a circumscribed area leads to increasing pressure for resources, which, in turn, will lead to increased violence between communities. Carneiro argues that it is within the context of this competitive violence that power will become increasingly centralized. Unlike Wittfogel&#39;s model, the &#8220;circumscription model&#8221; proposed by Carneiro suggests that it is the interaction among multiple factors that leads to the development of state societies.</p>
				
				<h3>The Source of Power</h3>
				
				<p>Exploring early state societies is essentially a search for the roots of power&#8211;the glue that held these large&#45;scale, highly differentiated societies together. How did some people gain the ability to control the actions of others? The critical characteristic of power in state societies is that it comes to reside in institutions as well as developing around charismatic individuals.</p>
				
				<p>A number of archaeologists have suggested that the control of information was a major element in the formation of state societies. The rise of a centralized bureaucracy rested on the ability to gather, control, and record information. The development of specialized craft production involved the transmission of elaborate technical skill and knowledge among a small group of people. The development of writing systems and mathematical knowledge gave the centralized government the ability to control resources and people.</p>
				
				<p>Theories of the origin of the state tend to focus on factors drawn from Western economics. Access to resources, control of labor, population size, competition, access to information, and bureaucracy are among the factors that are often stressed as underlying the power of the centralized government of early states.  Another approach is to ask how the people themselves saw the world in which they lived. From this perspective, it is likely that part of the power of rulers flowed from their possession of unique symbols of power and an intimate connection to the gods. The power of special objects, be they banners, thrones, or scepters, to invoke fear, awe, or loyalty is a force that must be kept in mind when trying to understand how centralized bureaucracies came to have legitimacy in the eyes of their subjects (Figure IV.6 on the next page).</p>

				<p>In the coming chapters, we will explore the emergence of state societies from a comparative perspective. We will begin with four societies that afford clear evidence of a complex social organization without the institutionalization of power that is characteristic of state societies. From this foundation, we will move on to examine early states in chapters organized geographically. Our own experience living in a world structured by complex local and global political interrelationships serves as the backdrop to all of these case studies. We are essentially examining how the world we inhabit came into being.</p>
