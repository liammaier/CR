						Lab at the University of Oregon since 1995. Professor Fickas headed
						the NSF Software Engineering Research Center (SERC) for five years,
						where he worked closely with partner companies attempting to do uptake
						of university research. Over the past nine years, he has participated
						in numerous lab and field studies centered on successes and failures
						of assistive technology for those with a cognitive impairment. From
						this experience, he co-developed the PC-RE model as well as the
						Software Pharmacy framework, both at the center of this project.

						as measured by research award expenditures per tenured faculty member
						demonstrating high level of institutional research support for Dr.
						Sohlberg'?'s work. Dr. Sohlberg is a nationally recognized researcher
						in the field of cognitive rehabilitation having published numerous
						research articles evaluating the effectiveness of cognitive interventions
						and two leading textbooks in the field. She is supported by a number of
						federal grants for the development and evaluation of assistive technology
						for cognition. Dr. Sohlberg has been involved in the development of evidence-based
						practice guidelines for the treatment of traumatic brain injury for the Academy of Neurologic Communication Disorders & Sciences,
						the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense. Dr. Sohlberg
						conducts clinical research and sees patients through the COE HEDCO clinic,
						a new state of the art multidisciplinary clinic that features eighteen
						therapy rooms that are outfitted with digital video cameras and microphones
						which are used to observe and record clinician-client interactions. Recently,
						Dr. Sohlberg opened up a veteran?s clinic in cooperation with the local
						veteran services agencies to provide cognitive rehabilitation services
						to local vets with mild to moderate brain injuries.

						<strong>Project Coordinator: Gina Griffiths MS CCC-SLP</strong> is a PhD candidate working under Drs. Sohlberg and
						Fickas. A speech pathologist since 1998, she has an extensive history within the field of cognitive
						rehabilitation including five years in home and community re-integration settings. In that position
						she frequently worked with adolescent and adult clients with acquired brain injury transitioning back
						to school or work situations that required high level reading skills. Prior to becoming a speech
						pathologist, she assisted with the development of software-based educational material. Her research
						interests are in the design and evaluation of treatment programs to address reading impairments following
						cognitive impairments, utilization and development of technology supports to enhance learning, and clinical teaching.
					</p>

					<p>
						Her interests include the development and evaluation of assistive technology to increase the social integration
						of people with chronic cognitive impairments, training clients with meta-cognitive strategies to manage executive
						function impairments and the development and evaluation of training methods used in graduate speech pathology programs.

					<p>
						(Portland VA Medical Center, Assistant Professor of Neurology, OHSU) has a special emphasis in treating veterans who
						have returned from Iraq and Afghanistan with mild traumatic brain injury or post-traumatic stress disorder. They
						present with deficits within the domains of executive control, selective attention, working memory, verbal learning,
						and processing speed that compromise, to varying degrees, their ability to succeed in the work place or in school.
						In particular, with regard to the current proposal, Dr. Sullivan has extensive experience in differentially diagnosing
						and treating, either directly, or indirectly, with the use of compensatory strategies, the impaired cognitive
						processes that contribute to high level reading impairment. Although Dr. Sullivan has focused primarily on his clinical
						work, he has an extensive background as a fully funded, independent investigator within the domains of selective
						attention and models of language processing. He has run his own laboratory and conducted all phases of research including
						experimental design, computerized set-up and programming of experiments, participant recruitment, data collection
						and analysis, and presentation of results.

						of Veterans Affairs joint venture. With regard to the current proposal, she serves as a member of TAMC?s interdisciplinary
						Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Team and provides direct services to Service Members and Veterans with mild TBI who demonstrate
						cognitive impairments that contribute to high level reading difficulties. She oversees TAMC Speech Pathology's
						Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program (CAP) workstation that provides assistive technology to Service Members with
						disabilities to promote positive rehabilitation outcomes and future employment opportunities. Ms. Mashima received
						supplemental appropriations in 2008 and 2009 from the Proponency Office for Rehabilitation and Reintegration, Office of
						the Army Surgeon General for two proposals to improve care for TBI. The purpose of the funded initiative was to convene
						a Working Group in cooperation with leading DoD and VA medical treatment facilities to develop a ?best practice? protocol
						to meet the mission of providing appropriate levels of SLP services to wounded Service Members and Veterans with traumatic brain injury.

						Assistant Professor at UO in Special Education and Clinical Sciences. Dr. Harn has coordinated multiple federally funded
						research projects focused on designing, implementing, and evaluating reading interventions for students with learning
						disabilities. Current emphasis is on understanding the role of attention or executive functioning skills in students who do
						not respond to evidenced-based interventions. Research papers have examined the issue of timed versus un-timed assessments
						and how important it is to include both types of standardized assessments when evaluating reading development. While
						working as a school psychologist for 4 years in California, Dr. Harn administered a range of diagnostic assessments to
						students across the age span to appropriately assess the specific areas of concern (i.e., social emotional, intellectual,
						academic) to assist in program development and evaluation of student progress.
