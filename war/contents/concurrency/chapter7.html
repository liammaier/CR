				<h2>Safety and Liveness Properties</h2>
				<div class="border"></div>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">A property is an attribute of a program that is true for every possible execution
				of that program.</span> Properties of interest for concurrent programs fall into two
				categories: <em>safety</em> and <em>liveness</em>. A safety property asserts that nothing bad happens
				during execution. A liveness property asserts that something good eventually
				happens. Another way of putting this is that safety is concerned with a program
				not reaching a bad state and that liveness is concerned with a program eventually
				reaching a good state.</p>

				<p class="i">In sequential programs, the most important safety property is that the final state
				is correct. We have already seen that for concurrent programs, important safety
				properties are mutual exclusion and the absence of deadlock. In the previous
				chapter, we determined that deadlock is generally a bad state from which no
				further actions can be executed. In Chapter 4, we saw that allowing more than one
				process to access a shared variable resulted in interference and thus incorrect or
				bad states.</p>

				<p class="i">The most important liveness property for a sequential program is that it
				eventually terminates. However, in concurrent programming, we are frequently
				concerned with systems that do not terminate. In this chapter, we primarily deal
				with liveness issues relating to resource access: are process requests for shared
				resources eventually granted? We will see that liveness properties are affected by
				the scheduling policy that determines which of a set of eligible actions are chosen
				for execution.</p>

				<p class="i">This chapter explains how we can analyze the finite state models of concurrent
				systems for both safety and liveness problems. The example of cars crossing a
				single-lane bridge is used to focus discussion. We then analyze a number of
				implementations of read/write locks. Read/write locks allow many processes to
				access a shared resource at the same time for read access, but require write access
				to be mutually exclusive. They occur in many concurrent programs.</p>

				<h3>7.1 Safety</h3>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">In the previous chapter, we saw that the <em>LTSA</em> analysis tool performs deadlock
				analysis using a breadth-first search on the labeled transition system corresponding
				to an <em>FSP</em> model.</span> The "bad" states that are the objective of this search are those
				states with no outgoing transitions, i.e. deadlock states. In addition to deadlock
				states, the search is looking for <code>ERROR</code> states. These are distinguished in the <em>LTS</em>
				by having a unique identity (−1). So far in the book, we have used the <code>ERROR</code> state
				explicitly denoted by the local process <code>ERROR</code>. In Chapter 4, we specified a test
				process that explicitly caused a transition to <code>ERROR</code> when it detected erroneous
				behavior. In Chapter 5, the <code>ERROR </code>state was used to detect when a finite range was
				exceeded. The example given in Figure 7.1 is an actuator that must not receive a
				second command before it has responded to the first.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/concurrency/images/figure7-1.png">
					<figcaption><strong>Figure 7.1</strong> <code>ACTUATOR</code> LTS.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>With no control system to ensure that the actuator does not receive multiple
				unacknowledged commands, <em>safety</em> analysis performed by LTSA produces the
				following trace:</p>

				<pre>
Trace to property violation in ACTUATOR:
	command
	command
				</pre>

				<p>In the test process of Chapter 4, the range excess of Chapter 5 and the actuator
				example of Figure 7.1, we have specified the situations regarded as errors rather
				than directly expressing the required safety property that we wish to preserve. In
				the actuator example, the safety property is that a <code>command</code> action must always
				be followed by a <code>respond</code> action without an intervening <code>command</code>. In complex
				systems it is usually better to specify safety properties by stating directly what <em>is</em>
				required rather than stating what is <em>not</em> required. In this way, we can concentrate</p>

				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">125</div>

				<p>on the desired behavior of a system rather than trying to enumerate all the possible
				undesirable behaviors.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="2" data-name="Safety Properties">

					<h4>7.1.1 Safety Properties</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Safety properties are specified in <em>FSP</em> by property processes.</span> Syntactically, these
					are simply <em>FSP</em> processes prefixed by the keyword <strong>property</strong>. They are composed
					with a target system to ensure that the specified property holds for that system.
					The example of Figure 7.2 specifies the property that it is polite to knock before
					entering a room.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src="/contents/concurrency/images/figure7-2.png">
						<figcaption><strong>Figure 7.2</strong> property <code>POLITE</code>.</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>The <em>LTS</em> diagram of Figure 7.2 reveals that in translating a property process, the
					compiler automatically generates the transitions to the <code>ERROR</code> state. It is easily
					seen that an <code>enter</code> action before a <code>knock</code> action causes a transition to the <code>ERROR</code>
					state. In addition, knocking twice is a violation of the <code>POLITE</code> property. It should
					be noted that in every state of the property process of Figure 7.2, all the actions
					in its alphabet (<code>enter,knock</code>) are eligible choices. Those that are not part of the
					behavior allowed by the safety property are transitions to the <code>ERROR</code> state. This is
					true of all property processes.</p>

					<p class="i">The property to check the correct operation of the <code>ACTUATOR</code> of Figure 7.1 is
					simply:</p>

					<pre>
<strong>property</strong> SAFE_ACTUATOR
     =(command->respond->SAFE_ACTUATOR).
     				</pre>

     				<p>Property processes may be composed with a system without affecting the correct
     				behavior of that system. In other words, composing a property process with a</p>

     				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">126</div>

     				<p>set of processes does not affect their normal operation. However, if behavior can
     				occur which violates the safety property, then a transition to the <code>ERROR</code> state
     				results. To preserve this <em>transparency</em> of safety properties, property processes
     				must be deterministic. That is they must not contain non-deterministic choices.
     				Experience has shown that this is rarely a restriction in practice.</p>

     				<div class="definition">A safety <strong>property</strong> P defines a deterministic process that asserts that any
     				trace including actions in the alphabet of P, is accepted by P.</div>

     				<p>Thus, if <code>P</code> is composed with <code>S</code>, then traces of actions that are in the alphabet of <code>S</code>
     				and the alphabet of <code>P</code>, must also be valid traces of <code>P</code>, otherwise <code>ERROR</code> is reachable.
     				We can specify that an action or a set of actions should never happen by using
     				alphabet extension. The example of Figure 7.3 asserts that <code>disaster</code> should never
     				happen.</p>

     				<p><span class="first-sentence">Listed below is a slightly modified version of the <code>SEMADEMO</code> model used in
     				section 5.2.1 to show how semaphores are used to ensure mutual exclusion.</span> The
     				modification is to replace the single action <code>critical</code> with the actions <code>enter</code> and
     				<code>exit</code> which model the entry and exit to the critical section in which mutually
     				exclusive access to a shared resource is required.</p>

              		<p>To verify that this system does in fact ensure mutual exclusion, we can specify a
              		mutual exclusion property and compose it with the system as follows:</p>

              		<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">127</div>

              		<pre>
<strong>property</strong> MUTEX =
      (p[i:1..3].enter->p[i].exit->MUTEX).

||CHECK = (SEMADEMO || MUTEX).
					</pre>

					<p>The safety property <code>MUTEX</code> specifies that when a process enters the critical section
					<code>(p[i].enter)</code>, the same process must exit the critical section <code>(p[i].exit)</code> before
					another process can enter. The property is not violated in the system as it stands;
					however, if we change the value with which the semaphore is initialized from
					one to two (i.e. <code>SEMAPHORE(2)</code>) then safety analysis using <em>LTSA</em> produces the
					following trace:</p>

					<pre>
Trace to property violation in MUTEX:
	p.1.mutex.down
	p.1.enter
	p.2.mutex.down
	p.2.enter
					</pre>

					<p>The trace is clearly a violation of mutual exclusion since two processes have
					entered the critical section.</p>

				<h3>7.2 Single-Lane Bridge Problem</h3>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">The problem is depicted in Figure 7.4.</span> A bridge over a river is only wide enough
				to permit a single lane of traffic. Consequently, cars can only move concurrently
				if they are moving in the same direction. A safety violation occurs if two cars
				moving in different directions enter the bridge at the same time.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/concurrency/images/figure7-4.png">
					<figcaption><strong>Figure 7.4</strong> Single-lane bridge.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">128</div>

				<p>To clarify the discussion, we refer to cars moving from left to right as red cars
				and cars moving from right to left as blue cars (see demonstration applet). In
				our concurrent-programming model, each car is a process and the problem is
				to ensure that cars moving in different directions cannot concurrently access the
				shared resource that is the bridge. To make the simulation more realistic, we must
				also ensure that cars moving in the same direction cannot pass each other.</p>

				<p class="i">In the following section, we develop a model of the system and a Java implementation
				that corresponds to the model. In this section, we are concerned primarily
				with the safety properties of the problem. Later in the chapter, we will address
				liveness issues.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="5" data-name="Single-Lane Bridge Model">

					<h4>7.2.1 Single-Lane Bridge Model</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">In modeling the single-lane bridge, we use the following constant and range
					definitions:</span></p>

					<pre>
<strong>const</strong> N = 3    <span>// number of each type of car</span>
<strong>range</strong> T = 0..N <span>// type of car count</span>
<strong>range</strong> ID= 1..N <span>// car identities</span>
					</pre>

					<p>The essence of the problem is access to the bridge, so the only events of interest
					in which a car participates are entering the bridge and leaving the bridge. Consequently,
					a car is modeled by a process that repeatedly enters and leaves the bridge:</p>

					<pre>
CAR = (enter->exit->CAR).
					</pre>

					<p>To model the fact that cars cannot pass each other on the bridge, we require the
					following processes which constrain the order of the <code>enter</code> and <code>exit</code> actions
					respectively:</p>

					<pre>
NOPASS1 = C[1], <span>//preserves entry order</span>
C[i:ID] = ([i].enter->C[i%N+1]).

NOPASS2 = C[1], <span>//preserves exit order</span>
C[i:ID] = ([i].exit->C[i%N+1]).

||CONVOY = ([ID]:CAR||NOPASS1||NOPASS2).
					</pre>

					<p>The <code>CONVOY</code> process models a set of cars traveling in the same direction that enter
					the bridge one after the other and leave the bridge one after the other. However,
					it does not stop one car exiting the bridge before the next car enters. The behavior
					of all cars is captured by the following composition:
					</p>

					<pre>
||CARS = (red:CONVOY || blue:CONVOY).
					</pre>

					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">129</div>

					<p>The remaining entity that must be modeled is the bridge itself. This must constrain
					<code>CARS</code> so that although one or more cars moving in the same direction may be on
					the bridge concurrently, cars moving in different directions may not. To enforce
					this, the bridge maintains a count of blue cars on the bridge and of red cars on the
					bridge. Red cars are only allowed to enter when the blue count is zero and vice
					versa. The <code>BRIDGE</code> process is listed below:</p>

					<pre>
BRIDGE = BRIDGE[0][0], <span>// initially empty</span>
BRIDGE[nr:T][nb:T] =   <span>//</span>nr <span>is the red count,</span> nb <span>the blue</span>
      (<strong>when</strong> (nb==0)
         red[ID].enter -> BRIDGE[nr+1][nb]
      |red[ID].exit    -> BRIDGE[nr-1][nb]
      |<strong>when</strong> (nr==0)
         blue[ID].enter-> BRIDGE[nr][nb+1]
      |blue[ID].exit   -> BRIDGE[nr][nb-1]
      ).
					</pre>

					<p>Note that the <code>exit</code> actions of the bridge permit the car counts, <code>nr</code> and <code>nb</code>, to
					be decremented even though their value is 0. As described in Chapter 5, the <em>FSP</em>
					compiler in the <em>LTSA</em> tool will automatically map these undefined states to the
					<code>ERROR</code> state, indicating this by issuing warnings:</p>

					<pre>
Warning - BRIDGE.-1.0 defined to be ERROR
Warning - BRIDGE.0.-1 defined to be ERROR
...
					</pre>

					<p>In fact, when <code>BRIDGE</code> is composed with <code>CARS</code>, their behavior prevents cars which
					have not entered from exiting and the <code>ERROR</code> state is unreachable.</p>

					<p class="i">Before describing the overall system composition, we need to specify a safety
					property to compose with the system that verifies that cars do not collide on the
					bridge. The required property is listed below. It specifies that while red cars are
					on the bridge only red cars can enter and while blue cars are on the bridge only
					blue cars can enter. When the bridge is empty, either a red car or a blue car
					may enter. The index <code>i</code> is used to count the red (or blue) cars currently on the
					bridge.</p>

					<pre>
<strong>property</strong> ONEWAY =(red[ID].enter  -> RED[1]
                 |blue[ID].enter -> BLUE[1]
                 ),
RED[i:ID] = (red[ID].enter -> RED[i+1]
            |<strong>when</strong>(i==1)red[ID].exit -> ONEWAY
            |<strong>when</strong>(i>1) red[ID].exit -> RED[i-1]
            ),
            		</pre>

            		<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">130</div>

            		<pre>
BLUE[i:ID]= (blue[ID].enter -> BLUE[i+1]

            |<strong>when</strong>(i>1) blue[ID].exit -> BLUE[i-1]
            ).
					</pre>

					<p>The entire system can now be modeled by the composite process specified in
					Figure 7.5.</p>

				<h3>7.3 Liveness</h3>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">A liveness property asserts that something good eventually happens.</span> A reasonable
				liveness property for the single-lane bridge would be that all red and blue cars
				eventually get to cross the bridge. As we have seen, the program developed
				in the previous section does not satisfy this property in the situation where
				there are three cars of each type. In this section, we see how models can be
				analyzed for liveness. Like deadlock and other safety properties, the objective is
				to solve liveness problems at the modeling stage so that they do not occur in the
				implemented program.</p>

				<p class="i">A completely general treatment of liveness is rather involved and requires
				the use of a temporal logic to specify the required liveness properties. Rather
				than burden the reader with another formalism, we deal with a restricted class
				of liveness properties which we term <em>progress</em>. A progress property asserts that
				whatever state a system is in, it is always the case that a specified action will
				eventually be executed. Progress is the opposite of <em>starvation</em>, the name given to a
				concurrent-programming situation in which an action is never executed. Progress
				properties are simple to specify and are sufficiently powerful to capture a wide
				range of liveness problems in concurrent programs.</p>

					<div class="definition"><strong>progress</strong> <code>P = {a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>..a<sub>n</sub>}</code> defines a progress property P which asserts
					that in an infinite execution of a target system, at least one of the actions
					<code>a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>..a<sub>n</sub></code> will be executed infinitely often.</div>

					<p>In other words, a progress property asserts that at any stage of execution one of
					the actions in the progress set will eventually occur. The liveness requirement for
					coin tossing can now be expressed as:</p>

					<pre>
<strong>progress</strong> HEADS = {heads}
<strong>progress</strong> TAILS = {tails}
					</pre>

					<p>The <code>COIN</code> system we have defined so far satisfies these properties. We now
					examine a system that does not. Suppose that the agent which tosses the coin first
					picks one of two coins: a normal coin with a head and a tail as defined in Figure 7.8
					and a trick coin which has a head on both sides. The outcome of tossing the trick
					coin must always be heads. This system is modeled in Figure 7.9.</p>

					<p class="i">Progress analysis of the <code>TWOCOIN</code> systemagainst the progress properties <code>HEADS</code>
					and <code>TAILS</code> produces the following output:</p>

Progress violation: TAILS

					<pre>
	pick
Actions in terminal set:
{toss, heads}
					</pre>

					<p>This confirms the expected result: if the agent picks the trick coin then the action
					<code>tails</code> will never occur. This is of course a violation of the <code>TAILS</code> progress
					property, which asserts that in an infinite execution, tails must occur infinitely
					often. The reader should note that the system of Figure 7.9 does not violate the
					progress property:</p>

					<pre>
<strong>progress</strong> HEADSorTAILS = {heads,tails}
					</pre>

					<p>Property <code>HEADSorTAILS</code> is not violated since only one of the actions in the
					progress set need be executed infinitely often to satisfy the property.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="9" data-name="Progress Analysis">

					<h4>7.3.2 Progress Analysis</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">Progress analysis involves first performing a search for terminal sets of states.</span></p>

					<div class="definition">A terminal set of states is one in which every state is reachable from every
					other state in the set via one or more transitions and there is no transition
					from within the set to any state outside the set.</div>

					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">138</div>

					<p>In graph theory, this is known as a strongly connected component, which has no
					path to any nodes outside the set of nodes in the component. For example, the
					labeled transition system of Figure 7.9 has two terminal sets of states, {1, 2}, which
					are the states relating to the trick coin, and {3, 4, 5}, which are the states relating to
					the normal coin.</p>

					<p class="i">An execution of a system represented by a finite set of states can only be infinite
					if some of the states are visited infinitely often. The states that are visited infinitely
					often in an execution must form a terminal set. Given fair choice, each terminal
					set of states represents an execution in which each transition in the set is executed
					infinitely often. Since there is no transition out of a terminal set, any action that
					is not used in all terminal sets cannot occur infinitely often in all executions of
					the system. Checking that a progress property holds is now simply checking that
					in each terminal set, at least one of the actions in the progress set occurs as a
					transition. Conversely, a progress property is violated if analysis finds a terminal
					set of states in which none of the progress set actions appear. For the TAILS
					property, this terminal set is the set of states {1, 2} in which the action tails does
					not occur. The output gives the shortest execution path to the root of the terminal
					set and lists the actions that do appear in the set.</p>

					<p class="i">If no progress properties are specified, <em>LTSA</em> performs progress analysis using
					a <em>default property</em>. This property asserts that for every action in the alphabet of the
					target system, given fair choice, that action will be executed infinitely often. This
					is equivalent to specifying a separate progress property for every action. For the
					<code>TWOCOIN</code> system, this default analysis produces the following output:</p>

					<pre>
Progress violation for actions:
{pick}
Path to terminal set of states:
	pick
Actions in terminal set:
{toss, heads, tails}

Progress violation for actions:
{pick, tails}
Path to terminal set of states:
	pick
Actions in terminal set:
{toss, heads}
					</pre>

					<p>The analysis produces two progress violations since the action <code>pick</code> is not executed
					infinitely often in either terminal set. The value of this default property is
					that if it is not violated, then no specified progress properties can be violated. In
					other words, if the default property holds, then every other progress property,</p>

					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">139</div>

					<p>specified in terms of subsets of the action alphabet of a target system, must also
					hold. This is true since the default property asserts that every action is executed
					infinitely often. All systems in which the states occur inside a single terminal set
					satisfy the default progress property.</p>

					<h4>7.3.3 Action Priority</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">If default progress analysis is applied to the single-lane bridge model then no
					violations are detected.</span> However, we know from the implementation that it is
					possible for progress violations to occur. Either the blue cars or the red cars may
					wait forever to cross the bridge. Why do we not detect these progress problems?</p>

					<p class="i">The answer lies in the fair choice assumption underlying the progress test.
					This means that every possible execution of the system will eventually happen
					including those in which cars do not starve. To detect progress problems we must
					superimpose some scheduling policy for actions, which models the situation in
					which the bridge is heavily used, i.e. we need to impose adverse conditions which
					"stress-test" the system. We use action priority expressions to describe these
					scheduling policies. Action priority is specified in <em>FSP</em> with respect to process
					compositions.</p>

					<h5>High Priority Operator (‘‘&lt;&lt;’’)</h5>

					<div class="definition"><code>||C = (P||Q)&lt;&lt;{a1,...,an}</code> specifies a composition in which the

					has one or more of the actions <code>a1,...,an</code> labeling a transition,

					<h5>Low Priority Operator (‘‘>>’’)</h5>

					<div class="definition"><code>||C = (P||Q)>>{a1,...,an}</code> specifies a composition in which the

				<h3>7.4 Liveness of the Single-Lane Bridge</h3>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">Using progress properties and action priorities, we are now in a position to
				investigate the liveness problems of the single-lane bridge.</span> In particular, we are
				interested in the following two progress properties when the bridge is heavily

				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">141</div>

				<pre>
<strong>progress</strong> BLUECROSS = {blue[ID].enter}
<strong>progress</strong> REDCROSS  = {red[ID].enter}
				</pre>

				<p><code>BLUECROSS</code> asserts that it is always the case that one of the blue cars will be
				able to enter the bridge; <code>REDCROSS</code> asserts the same for red cars. This leaves the
				problem of how to model congestion using action priority. If we give all the actions
				related to red cars priority over blue cars we get the situation where <code>BLUECROSS</code> is
				violated and similarly if we give blue cars priority <code>REDCROSS</code> is violated. Neither
				of these scheduling policies is a good model of the program. Neither red nor blue
				cars have priority in the implementation. Instead, we give car exit from the bridge
				low priority. This models the situation where the bridge is congested since in any
				choice between another car entering the bridge and a car leaving the bridge, we
				choose to let a car enter. The congested bridge is modeled by:</p>

				<pre>
||CongestedBridge = (SingleLaneBridge)
                     >>{red[ID].exit,blue[ID].exit}.
				</pre>

				<p>Progress analysis of this system against the properties <code>BLUECROSS</code> and <code>REDCROSS</code>
				produces the following output:</p>

				<pre>
Progress violation: BLUECROSS
Path to terminal set of states:
	red.1.enter
	red.2.enter
Actions in terminal set:
{red.1.enter, red1.exit, red.2.enter,
red.2.exit, red.3.enter, red.3.exit}
Progress violation: REDCROSS
Path to terminal set of states:
	blue.1.enter
	blue.2.enter
Actions in terminal set:
{blue.1.enter, blue.1.exit, blue.2.enter,
blue.2.exit, blue.3.enter, blue.3.exit}
				</pre>

				<p>The output corresponds with observations of the program. When there are three
				cars and a red car enters first then the bridge is continuously occupied by red
				cars and blue cars never cross. Similarly, red cars never cross if a blue car enters
				first. However, the model abstracts from a number of program details such as the
				length of the bridge and consequently, the number of cars needed to continuously
				occupy it. As a result, the model detects lack of progress when there are only two
				cars moving in each direction. The terminal sets of states for this scenario can
				clearly be seen in the transition system depicted in Figure 7.11.</p>

					<h4>7.4.1 Revised Single-Lane Bridge Model</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">A bridge which decides dynamically at any given point whether to admit blue cars
					or red cars needs to have more information about the state of cars than is currently available in the model.</span></p>

					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">143</div>

					<p>In particular, the bridge needs to know whether cars are
					waiting to cross. To this end, the model for a car is modified so that it requests
					access to the bridge before attempting to enter. The revised model for a car is:</p>

					<pre>
CAR = (request->enter->exit->CAR).
					</pre>

					<p>The bridge model can now count the number of cars waiting at each end. The
					count is incremented when a car requests access and decremented when the car
					enters the bridge. Our first attempt at a revised <code>BRIDGE</code> process uses this count of
					waiting cars as follows. Red cars are only allowed to enter the bridge if there are
					no blue cars on the bridge and there are no blue cars waiting. Blue cars are only
					allowed to enter the bridge if there are no red cars on the bridge and no red cars
					waiting to enter the bridge. The revised <code>BRIDGE</code> process is as follows:</p>

					<pre>
/* nr - <em>number of red cars on the bridge</em>
   nb - <em>number of blue cars on the bridge</em>
   wr - <em>number of red cars waiting to enter</em>
   wb - <em>number of blue cars waiting to enter</em>
*/<em></em>
BRIDGE = BRIDGE[0][0][0][0],
BRIDGE[nr:T][nb:T][wr:T][wb:T] =
  (red[ID].request  -> BRIDGE[nr][nb][wr+1][wb]
  |<strong>when</strong> (nb==0 &amp;&amp; wb==0)
     red[ID].enter  -> BRIDGE[nr+1][nb][wr-1][wb]
  |red[ID].exit     -> BRIDGE[nr-1][nb][wr][wb]
  |blue[ID].request -> BRIDGE[nr][nb][wr][wb+1]
  |<strong>when</strong> (nr==0 &amp;&amp; wr==0)
     blue[ID].enter -> BRIDGE[nr][nb+1][wr][wb-1]
  |blue[ID].exit    -> BRIDGE[nr][nb-1][wr][wb]
  ).
					</pre>

					<p>The problem with this model is that when we check the safety properties of the
					new <code>SingleLaneBridge</code> system, a deadlock is reported:</p>

					<pre>
Trace to DEADLOCK:
	red.1.request
	red.2.request
	red.3.request
	blue.1.request
	blue.2.request
	blue.3.request

					<p>The trace is the scenario in which there are cars waiting at both ends, and
					consequently, the bridge does not allow either red or blue cars to enter. To solve</p>

					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">144</div>

					<p>this problem, we must introduce some <em>asymmetry</em> into the problem (as was done
					for the Dining Philosophers in Chapter 6). This takes the form of a boolean variable
					(<code>bt</code>) which indicates whether it is the turn of blue cars or red cars to enter the
					bridge. Initially, <code>bt</code> is set to true indicating it is blue’s turn. As soon as a blue car
					exits the bridge, <code>bt</code> is set to false. When a red car exits, <code>bt</code> is set to true again. The
					<code>BRIDGE</code> process becomes:</p>

					<pre>

range B = False..True
/* nr - <em>number of red cars on the bridge</em>
   nb - <em>number of blue cars on the bridge</em>
   wr - <em>number of red cars waiting to enter</em>
   wb - <em>number of blue cars waiting to enter</em>
   bt - <em>true indicates blue turn,</em>
        <em>false indicates red turn</em>
*/
BRIDGE = BRIDGE[0][0][0][0][True],
BRIDGE[nr:T][nb:T][wr:T][wb:T][bt:B] =
  (red[ID].request ->BRIDGE[nr][nb][wr+1][wb][bt]

    blue[ID].enter ->BRIDGE[nr][nb+1][wr][wb-1][bt]
  |blue[ID].exit   ->BRIDGE[nr][nb-1][wr][wb][False]
).
					</pre>

					<p>The condition under which the bridge permits a red car to enter is that there are no
					blue cars on the bridge and either there are no blue cars waiting or it is not blue’s
					turn: <code>nb==0 &amp;&amp;(wb==0 || !bt)</code>. The condition for a blue car to enter is that there

				<h3>7.5 Readers–Writers Problem</h3>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">The Readers–Writers problem is concerned with access to a shared database by
			    two kinds of processes.</span> Readers execute transactions that examine the database
				while Writers both examine and update the database. For the database to be
				updated correctly, Writers must have exclusive access to the database while they
				are updating it. If no Writer is accessing the database, any number of Readers
				may concurrently access it. In this section, we develop a solution to the problem.
				As usual, we construct a model of the problem to examine its safety and liveness
				properties before proceeding to an implementation.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="15" data-name="Readers-Writers Model">

					<h4>7.5.1 Readers-Writers Model</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">In modeling the problem, the first step is to decide on the actions of interest.</span>
					These are acquiring and releasing read access to the shared database and
					acquiring and releasing write access. The actions are declared below as the set
					<code>Actions</code>:</p>

					<pre>
<strong>set</strong> Actions = {acquireRead,releaseRead,
               acquireWrite,releaseWrite}
               		</pre>

               		<p>As for the Ornamental Garden model in section 4.1.2, we use a set constant simply
               		as a way of abbreviating the model description. The processes that model Readers
               		and Writers are:</p>

               		<pre>
READER =
  (acquireRead->examine->releaseRead->READER)
  +Actions
  \ {examine}.

WRITER =
  (acquireWrite->modify->releaseWrite->WRITER)
  +Actions
  \ {modify}.
  					</pre>

  					<p>A <code>READER</code> process must acquire read access before examining the database
  					and a <code>WRITER</code> must acquire write access before modifying the database. The
  					alphabets of both processes have been defined to be the full set of access actions
  					by the alphabet extension <code>+Actions</code>. This ensures that while a <code>READER</code> only
  					engages in the <code>acquireRead</code> and <code>releaseRead</code> actions, the <code>acquireWrite</code>
  					and <code>releaseWrite</code> actions cannot occur freely for any prefixed instance of the
  					process. Similarly, for <code>WRITER</code> processes, the <code>acquireRead</code> and <code>releaseRead</code></p>

  					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">147</div>

  					<p>actions cannot occur freely. The <code>examine</code> and <code>modify</code> actions are hidden since
  					they are irrelevant to the problem of synchronizing access to the shared database.</p>

  					<p class="i">Access to the shared database is controlled by a read/write lock. The lock
  					accepts <code>acquireRead</code> actions when it has not been acquired for write access by
  					<code>acquireWrite</code>. It permits only a single write access when it has not been acquired
  					for read access. The lock is modeled by the <code>RW_LOCK</code> process:</p>

  					<pre>
<strong>const</strong> False = 0   <strong>const</strong> True = 1
<strong>range</strong> Bool  = False..True
<strong>const</strong> Nread = 2         <span>// Maximum readers</span>
<strong>const</strong> Nwrite= 2         <span>// Maximum writers</span>

RW_LOCK = RW[0][False],
RW[readers:0..Nread][writing:Bool] =
      (<strong>when</strong> (!writing)
         acquireRead ->RW[readers+1][writing]
      |releaseRead   ->RW[readers-1][writing]
      |<strong>when</strong> (readers==0 &amp;&amp; !writing)
         acquireWrite->RW[readers][True]
      |releaseWrite  ->RW[readers][False]
      ).
					</pre>

					<p>The <code>RW_LOCK</code> process maintains a count of the number of concurrent read accesses
					(<code>readers</code>) and a boolean (<code>writing</code>) which is set to true when the lock is acquired
					for write access. The action to acquire read access is only accepted when <code>writing</code>
					is false and the action to acquire write access is only accepted when <code>readers==0</code>
					and <code>writing</code> is false.
					</p>

					<h5>Safety Property</h5>

					<p>To check that the lock behaves as desired, we define a safety property, <code>RW_SAFE</code>,
					as follows:</p>

					<pre>
<strong>property</strong> SAFE_RW
  = (acquireRead->READING[1]
    |acquireWrite->WRITING
    ),
READING[i:1..Nread]
  = (acquireRead->READING[i+1]
    |<strong>when</strong>(i>1) releaseRead ->READING[i-1]
    |<strong>when</strong>(i==1)releaseRead ->SAFE_RW
    ),
WRITING = (releaseWrite->SAFE_RW).
					</pre>

					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">148</div>

					<p>The property asserts that initially either an <code>acquireRead</code> action or a
					<code>acquireWrite</code> action can be accepted. In other words when the lock is free,
					it can be acquired for either read or write access. When acquired for read access
					(<code>READING</code>), further <code>acquireRead</code> actions are permitted but no <code>acquireWrite</code>
					actions. The lock does not become free until all the <code>releaseRead</code> actions which
					correspond to the <code>acquireRead</code> actions have happened. When the lock has been
					acquired for write access (<code>WRITING</code>), only the <code>releaseWrite</code> action should occur.
					To check that the lock implementation <code>RW_LOCK</code> satisfies the property, the lock is
					composed with the property as follows:</p>

					<pre>
||READWRITELOCK = (RW_LOCK || SAFE_RW).
					</pre>

					<p>The resulting <em>LTS</em> is depicted in Figure 7.13.</p>

					<figure>
						<img src="/contents/concurrency/images/figure7-13.png">
						<figcaption><strong>Figure 7.13</strong> <code>READWRITELOCK</code> <em>LTS</em>.</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<p>The transitions to the <code>ERROR</code> state in Figure 7.13 occur if a Reader or Writer is badly
					behaved. For example, if a Reader performs a <code>releaseRead</code> without previously
					having performed an <code>acquireRead</code> then a safety violation will occur. A violation
					will also occur if more than two <code>acquireRead</code> requests are made.</p>

					<p class="i">The composition of <code>READER</code> and <code>WRITER</code> processes with the read/write lock is
					described in Figure 7.14. Analysis of this system reveals no deadlocks or safety
					violations. The addition of well-behaved <code>READER</code> and <code>WRITER</code> processes ensures
					that the error transitions of Figure 7.13 cannot occur.</p>

					</figure>

					<h5>Progress Property</h5>

					<p>The progress properties that are important in the Readers–Writers system are that
					both Readers and Writers should eventually acquire access to the shared database.
					We can express the required progress properties as follows:</p>

					<pre>
<strong>progress</strong> WRITE = {writer[1..Nwrite].acquireWrite}
<strong>progress</strong> READ  = {reader[1..Nread].acquireRead}
					</pre>

					<p>The <code>WRITE</code> property asserts that it should always be the case that at least one of
					the <code>WRITER</code> processes can perform an <code>acquireWrite</code> action. Since <code>WRITER</code> s are
					completely symmetric, we can reasonably expect that if one can <code>acquireWrite</code>
					then so can the others. <code>READ</code> specifies the same property for <code>READER</code> processes and
					<code>acquireRead</code>. A progress check reports no violations of these properties in the
					system specified by <code>READERS_WRITERS</code>. Because of the fair choice assumption,
					progress problems only occur in complete system models that are erroneous.
					To find how the system performs when loaded or "<code></code>stressed", we must specify
					adverse scheduling conditions using action priority. This is exactly the procedure
					we adopted to find the progress problems in the single-lane bridge model. Indeed,
					the adverse conditions are similar to those used in the bridge problem. To model
					a heavily loaded system, we give lower priority to <code>release</code> actions in the same
					way we gave lower priority to <code>exit</code> actions in the bridge problem. (Alternatively,
					we could give higher priority to the <code>acquire</code> actions.) The system model used for
					progress analysis is described by:</p>

					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">150</div>

					<pre>

					to this progress problem, we translate the existing model into an implementation

					<p class="i">The guarded actions from the model become synchronized methods containing

					include a call to <code>notifyAll()</code> in every monitor method that modifies the state

					<h4>7.5.3 Revised Readers–Writers Model and Implementation</h4>

					<p><span class="first-sentence">To address the progress problem discovered with our first model and implementation
					of the Readers–Writers problem, we adopt an approach in which Readers
					are denied access if there are Writers waiting to acquire access.</span> This should give
					Writers priority in acquiring the lock and avoid the situation in which they wait
					forever for access. To detect that a Writer is waiting for access, we must add another
					action to its repertoire. A Writer must request access before attempting to acquire
					it. This is exactly the same solution we adopted in the single-lane bridge solution
					to detect whether cars were waiting. The additional action is <code>requestWrite</code> and
					the revised <code>WRITER</code> process is shown below:
					</p>

					<pre>
<strong>set</strong> Actions = {acquireRead,releaseRead,
       acquireWrite,releaseWrite,requestWrite}
WRITER =
   (requestWrite->acquireWrite->modify
                ->releaseWrite->WRITER
   )+Actions\{modify}.
					</pre>
				
					<p>The <code>READER</code> process remains unchanged. <code>RW_LOCK</code> is modified to maintain a count
					of waiting Writers (<code>waitingW</code>). The count is incremented when a Writer requests
					access and decremented when it actually acquires access. Readers are only allowed
					to acquire the lock when the number of waiting Writers is zero. The revised lock
					process is listed below:</p>

					<pre>
RW_LOCK = RW[0][False][0],
RW[readers:0..Nread]
  [writing:Bool]
  [waitingW:0..Nwrite] =
  (<strong>when</strong> (!writing &amp;&amp; waitingW==0)
     acquireRead -> RW[readers+1][writing][waitingW]
  |releaseRead   -> RW[readers-1][writing][waitingW]
  |<strong>when</strong> (readers==0 &amp;&amp; !writing)
     acquireWrite-> RW[readers][True][waitingW-1]
  |releaseWrite  -> RW[readers][False][waitingW]
  |requestWrite  -> RW[readers][writing][waitingW+1]
  ).
					</pre>

					<p>This definition of <code>RW_LOCK</code> still satisfies the <code>RW_SAFE</code> property. Note that we
					have not had to change the definition of the safety property. The <code>request</code> action
					(<code>requestWrite</code>) is not relevant to the safe operation of the lock and so does not
					appear in the alphabet of the safety property. Safety is determined only by the
					correct sequencing of <code>acquire</code> and <code>release</code> actions.</p>

					<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">154</div>

					<p>A progress analysis of <code>RW_PROGRESS</code> now produces the output:</p>

					<pre>
Progress violation: READ
Path to terminal set of states:
     writer.1.requestWrite
     writer.2.requestWrite
Actions in terminal set:
{writer.1.requestWrite, writer.1.acquireWrite,
 writer.1.releaseWrite, writer.2.requestWrite,
 writer.2.acquireWrite, writer.2.releaseWrite}
					</pre>

					<p>We no longer have a violation of the <code>WRITE</code> property, demonstrating that in this
					Writers priority system, Writers can always access the shared database. However,
					we now have a <code>READ</code> progress violation. This occurs since, if there is always a
					Writer waiting to acquire the lock, then Readers will never gain access. However,
					in the practical application of read/write locks, the Writers priority solution is
					often satisfactory since there are usually many more read accesses to a database
					than write accesses. In addition, it may be important that Readers get the most
					up-to-date information. The implementation of a Writers priority lock is listed in
					Program 7.8. It follows directly from the revised definition of <code>RW_LOCK</code>.</p>

					<p class="i">A version of the read/write lock that satisfies both the <code>READ</code> and <code>WRITE</code>
					properties involves the addition of a boolean which indicates whether it is the
					Readers’ turn or the Writers’ turn. Readers only defer to waiting Writers when it
					is not their turn to acquire the lock. This turn variable plays exactly the same role
					in the Readers–Writers problem as the turn variable in the single-lane bridge. The
					final version of the read/write lock model is listed below. The implementation is
					left as an exercise.
					</p>

					<pre>
RW_LOCK = RW[0][False][0][False],
RW[readers:0..Nread]

  [waitingW:0..Nwrite]
  [readersturn:Bool] =

				<h3>Summary</h3>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">A <em>safety</em> property asserts that nothing bad happens during the execution of a
				program and a <em>liveness</em> property asserts that something good eventually happens.</span>
				In this chapter, we described how <em>FSP</em> models can be checked for both safety and
				liveness properties.</p>

				<p class="i">A safety property is defined by a deterministic process <strong>property</strong> <code>P</code>. This asserts
				that any trace including actions in the alphabet of <code>P</code> is accepted by <code>P</code>. When the
				property <code>P</code> is composed with a system <code>S</code>, traces of actions that are in the alphabet
				of <code>S</code> and the alphabet of <code>P</code> must also be valid traces of <code>P</code>, otherwise the <code>ERROR</code> state
				is reachable. Consequently, if safety analysis does not detect an <code>ERROR</code> state, we
				know that the property holds for the system.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">156</div>

				<p class="i">We defined a subset of liveness properties which we termed <em>progress</em> properties.
				A progress property is defined by a progress set of action labels. It asserts
				that in any infinite execution of a system, one of the actions in the progress
				set must happen infinitely often. In asserting progress, it is necessary to make
				some scheduling assumptions as to which transitions are chosen for execution.
				We assume fair choice for a set of transitions such that if the set is executed
				infinitely often, then every transition in the set will be executed infinitely often.
				To investigate the liveness problems that occurred in our example programs, we
				introduced a way of specifying action priority that let us superimpose a specific
				scheduling policy on fair choice. This enabled us to model adverse situations in
				which processes compete for scarce resources.</p>

				<p class="i">The example programs developed in this chapter had a fixed set of threads
				competing for a resource. In Chapter 9, we examine systems in which the size of
				the set varies as threads are dynamically created and terminated.

				<h3>Notes and Further Reading</h3>

				<p><span class="first-sentence">The terms <em>safety</em> and <em>liveness</em> applied to concurrent programs were first introduced
				by Lamport (1977).</span> In this book, we have adopted a modeling approach to reasoning
				about concurrent programs and consequently a model-checking approach to
				verifying properties. As discussed at the end of Chapter 5, an alternative approach
				is to reason about safety properties of concurrent programs using assertions and
				invariants specified in predicate logic. The reader should consult Greg Andrews’
				book (1991) for an extensive exposition of this approach.</p>

				<p class="i">The mechanisms used in this chapter for checking safety and progress properties
				have been developed by the authors and their colleagues. The safety property
				technique is due to Cheung and Kramer (1999). Progress checking as described
				here is due to Giannakopoulou, Magee and Kramer (1999) and is a simplified
				form of a more general technique for checking that properties specified in Linear
				Temporal Logic (LTL) hold for a system. The property that our approach checks
				is that an action always eventually occurs. As an LTL formula, this is specified
				as <img class="inline" src="/contents/concurrency/images/small_square.png"><img class="inline" src="/contents/concurrency/images/small_diamond.png"> <strong>a</strong>, where <img class="inline" src="/contents/concurrency/images/small_square.png"> means always and <img class="inline" src="/contents/concurrency/images/small_diamond.png"> means eventually. The general technique
				involves translating the LTL formula into B&#252;chi automata and then composing the
				B&#252;chi automata with the target system and performing a connected component
				analysis of the resulting automata (Gribomont and Wolper, 1989). Technically,
				this is a check that the system is a valid model of the formula – the origin of
				the term model checking, which we have used in the looser sense to refer to any
				technique for analyzingmodels. B&#252;chi automata are a form of finite state automata
				which recognize infinite sequences of actions. The interested reader should look
				at Holzmann’s SPIN model checker (Holzmann, 1991, 1997) which uses this
				approach. The pioneering work on model checking is due to Clarke, Emerson and</p>

				<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">157</div>

				<p>Sistla (1986). Fred Schneider (1997) provides an introduction to temporal logic and
				discusses derivation and reasoning about concurrent programs.</p>

				<p class="i">Chapter 14 provides more details on the use of LTL for property checking, and
				introduces <em>fluents</em> to <em>FSP</em> as a means of specifying state-based properties in an
				event-based formalism such as <em>LTS</em>. Fairness and the use of B¨ uchi automata are
				also discussed and supported by <em>LTSA</em> for property checking.</p>

				<p class="i">The topic of fairness in concurrent programs has an extensive literature. We
				have used a strong form of fair choice. For an extensive discussion on the different
				classes of fairness, see the book by Francez (1986).</p>
