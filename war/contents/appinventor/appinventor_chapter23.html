				<p>
					<span class="first_sentence">Until the popularization of the smartphone, computing was on desktop lockdown.</span> Yes, laptops are mobile, but not in the same sense as the tiny devices we now carry around in our pockets. Computing has left the lab and the office, and is now taking place out in the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					One significant effect of carrying our computing with us is a new, very interesting piece of data for every app: a current location. Knowing where people are as they move about the world has far-reaching implications and the potential to help us greatly in our lives. It also has the potential to invade our privacy and be a detriment to humanity.
				</p>
				<p>
					The &ldquo;Android, Where&rsquo;s My Car?&rdquo; app (Chapter 7) is an example of a location-aware app that provides a personal benefit. It lets you remember a previous location so you can get back to it at a later time. That app is private&mdash;your location information is stored only in your phone&rsquo;s database.

		  			The same idea can be applied to groups. For instance, a group of hikers might want to keep track of one another&rsquo;s whereabouts in the wilderness, or a group of business associates might want to find one another at a large conference. Such apps are starting to appear in the marketplace, with two of the most popular being Google&rsquo;s Latitude (<span class="url">www.google.com/latitude</span>), and Facebook&rsquo;s Places (<span class="url">www.facebook.com/ places</span>). Due to the public&rsquo;s privacy concerns, these apps faced criticism on their launch.
		  		</p>
		  		<p>
		  			Another type of location-aware app uses <span class="new_term">augmented-reality</span> tools. These apps use your location and the phone&rsquo;s orientation to provide overlay information that augments the natural setting. So you might point a phone at a building and see its price on the real-estate market, or you might walk near an exotic plant in a botanical garden and have an app tell you its species. Early players in this genre include Wikitude, Layar, and Google Sky Map.
		  		</p>
		  		<p>
		  			Wikitude even allows users to add data to the <span class="new_term">mobile cloud</span> through its website, <span class="url">http://wikitude.me</span>. At the site, you pull up a map to geotag the information you post. Later, when you or someone else uses Wikitude&rsquo;s mobile app at that location, your information appears.

				<h4>GPS</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="first_sentence">To create a location-aware app, you first need to understand how the global positioning system (GPS) works.</span> GPS data comes from a satellite system maintained by the US government. As long as you have an unobstructed sight line to at least three satellites in the system, your phone can get a reading. A GPS reading consists of your latitude, longitude, and altitude. Latitude is how far north or south you are of the equator, with values for north being positive and south being negative. The range is &mdash;90 to 90. Figure 23-1 shows a Google map of a spot near Quito, Ecuador. The latitude shown on the ap is &mdash;0.01&mdash;just barely south of the equator!

			  		Longitude is how far east or west you are of the Prime Meridian; east coordinates have positive values and west coordinates are negative. The most well-known place it runs through is Greenwich, a town near London that is the home of the Royal Observatory. The map in Figure 23-2 shows Greenwich and its longitude of 0.0.

					<span class="first_sentence">App Inventor provides the <span class="code">LocationSensor</span> component for accessing GPS information. </span>The component has properties for <span class="code">Latitude</span>, <span class="code">Longitude</span>, and <span class="code">Altitude</span>.

					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					This event is triggered the first time the sensor gets a reading and each subsequent time the phone is moved enough so that new data is read. There&rsquo;s often a delay of quite a few seconds before an app&rsquo;s first reading, and sometimes the device can&rsquo;t get a reading at all. For instance, if you&rsquo;re indoors and not connected to WiFi, the device might not get a reading. Your phone also has settings that allow you to turn GPS reading off to save battery life; this is another potential reason the component can&rsquo;t get a reading. For these reasons, you shouldn&rsquo;t assume that the <span class="code">LocationSensor</span> properties have a valid setting until the <span class="program_block">LocationSensor.LocationChanged</span> event occurs.
				</p>
				<p>
					One way to deal with the unknowns in location sensing is to create a variable <span class="code">lastKnownLocation</span>, initialize it to &ldquo;unknown,&rdquo;and then have the <span class="program_block">LocationSensor.LocationChanged</span> event handler change the value of that variable, as shown in Figure 23-5.

			  		By programming the <span class="program_block">LocationSensor.LocationChanged</span> event handler in this way, you can always display the current location or record it in a database, with &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; appearing until the first reading. This strategy is used in No Texting While Driving (Chapter 4); that app autoresponds to SMS texts and includes either &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; or the last reading taken in the response.

				<h4>Checking Boundaries</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="first_sentence">One common use of the <span class="program_block">LocationChanged</span> event is to check whether the device is within a <span class="new_term">boundary</span>, or a set area.</span> For example, consider the code in Figure 23-7, which vibrates the phone each time a new reading shows that a person has moved farther than 0.1 longitude from the Prime Meridian.

				<p>
					Such boundary checking has numerous applications; for example, warning parolees if they&rsquo;re nearing a legally specified distance from their home, or alerting parents or teachers if a child leaves the playground area. If you&rsquo;d like to see a slightly more complex example, see Chapter 18&rsquo;s discussion of conditional blocks.

				<h4>Location Information Providers: GPS, WiFi, and Cell ID</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="first_sentence">An Android device can determine its own location in a number of ways.</span> The most accurate method&mdash;within a few meters&mdash;is through the satellites that make up the GPS maintained by the US government. You won&rsquo;t get a reading, however, if you&rsquo;re inside and there are skyscrapers or other objects in the way; you need a clear path to at least three satellites in the system.
				</p>
				<p>
					If GPS isn&rsquo;t available or the user has disabled it, the device can obtain its position through a wireless network. You have to be near a WiFi router, of course, and the position reading you&rsquo;ll get is the latitude/longitude of that WiFi station.
				</p>
				<p>
					A third way a device can determine positioning is through Cell ID. Cell ID provides a location for the phone based on the strength of signals from nearby cell phone tow- ers. It is generally not very accurate unless you have numerous cell towers near you. However, it does use the least amount of battery power compared to GPS or WiFi connectivity.

				<h3>Using the Orientation Sensor</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="first_sentence">The <span class="code">OrientationSensor</span> is used for game-like apps in which the user controls the action by tilting the device.</span> It can also be used as a compass to find out which direction (north/south, east/west) the phone is pointing.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <span class="code">OrientationSensor</span> has five properties, all of which are unfamiliar to most people other than aeronautical engineers:
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt><span class="code">Roll</span><em>(Left&mdash;Right)</em></dt>
						<dd>
							<span class="code">Roll</span> is 0 degrees when the device is level, increases to 90 degrees as the device is tilted up onto its left side, and decreases to −90 degrees when the device is tilted up onto its right side.
						</dd>
					<dt><span class="code">Pitch</span><em>(Up&mdash;Back)</em></dt>
						<dd>
						<span class="code">Pitch</span> is 0 degrees when the device is level, increases to 90 degrees as the device is tilted so its top is pointing down, and increases further to 180 degrees as it is turned over. Similarly, as the device is tilted so its bottom points down, Pitch decreases to −90 degrees and then down to −180 degrees as it is turned all the way over.
						</dd>
					<dt><span class="code">Yaw</span><em>(Compass)</em></dt>
						<dd>
							<span class="code">Yaw</span> is 0 degrees when the top of the device is pointing north, 90 degrees when it is pointing east, 180 degrees when it is pointing south, and 270 degrees when it is pointing west.
						</dd>
					<dt><span class="code">Magnitude</span><em>(Speed of a rolling ball)</em></dt>
						<dd>
							<span class="code">Magnitude</span> returns a number between 0 and 1 that indicates how much the de- vice is tilted. Its value indicates the force exerted by a ball rolling on the surface of the device.
						</dd>
					<div class="pagebreak unlisted">

				</dl>
				<p>
					The <span class="code">OrientationSensor</span> also provides the <span class="program_block">OrientationChanged</span> event, which is trig- gered every time the orientation changes. To explore these properties further, write an app that illustrates how the properties change as the user tilts the device. Just add five heading labels, and five other labels to show the current values of the properties in the preceding list. Then add the blocks shown in Figure 23-8.

					The <span class="code">OrientationSensor</span>&rsquo;s Roll property will tell you if the phone is tilted left or right (i.e., if you hold the phone upright and tilt it slightly to the left, you&rsquo;ll get a positive reading for the roll; if you tilt it slightly right, you&rsquo;ll get a negative reading). Therefore, you can let the user move an object with an event handler like the one shown in Figure 23-10.

				<p>
					The blocks multiply the roll by &mdash;1, as tilting left gives a positive roll and should move the object left (thereby making the x coordinate smaller). For a review of how the coordinate system works in animated apps, see Chapter 17.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that this app works only when the device is in portrait mode (upright), not in landscape mode. As is, if you tilt the phone too far, the screen will autorotate into landscape mode and the image will stay marooned on the left side of the screen. The reason is that if the device is on its side, it is tilted left and thus will always get a positive reading for the roll. A positive roll reading, as shown in the blocks in Figure 23-10, will always make the x coordinate smaller.
				</p>
				<p>
					If App Inventor provided the capability, you could either (1) lock the phone so it didn&rsquo;t autorotate for this app, or (2) find out the phone&rsquo;s mode and modify your formula for moving the object based on that setting. Such capabilities will certainly be added to the system, but you should instruct your users on how the app works currently.

				<h4>Using the Phone As a Compass</h4>

					<span class="first_sentence">Compass apps and apps like Google Sky Map need to know the phone&rsquo;s orientation in the world, east/west and north/south.</span> Sky Map uses the information to overlay information about the constellations at which the phone is pointing.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <span class="code">Yaw</span> reading is useful for this type of orientation. <span class="code">Yaw</span> is always between 0 and 360 degrees, with 0 being north; 90, east; 180, south; and 270, west. So a reading of 45 means the phone is pointing northeast, 135 means southeast, 225 means south- west, and 315 means northwest.

					Figure 23-15 shows a sample app that lets the user calibrate the readings and then detects acceleration.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can download and install this app from <span class="url">http://examples.oreilly.com/0636920016632/</span>. Run it, set the phone on a table, and click Calibrate. The read- ings will appear in the &ldquo;Readings when flat&rdquo; area. If you raise the phone slowly, the readings in the &ldquo;Significant accelerations&rdquo; area won&rsquo;t change. But if you raise the phone rapidly, the &ldquo;No&rdquo; reading for Z will change to &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; as shown in Figure 23-15. Similarly, if you move the phone rapidly across the table, you&rsquo;ll get a significant acceleration for X or Y. Figure 23-16 shows the blocks for getting the initial calibration.

					These blocks take the readings and place them in three labels: <span class="code">XCalibLabel</span>, <span class="code">YCalibLabel</span>, and <span class="code">ZCalibLabel</span>. The blocks also initialize the labels that will be used to report accelerations later, after this calibration step.

					The accelerometer should get a reading of <span class="code">zAccel</span> around 9.8 when the phone is flat, and <span class="code">xAccel</span> and <span class="code">yAccel</span> readings of around 0. But the calibration step tells us exactly how the accelerometer is working. Once the calibration readings are set, your app

					can detect changes in the <span class="url">x</span>, <span class="url">y</span>, or <span class="url">z</span> dimensions by measuring new readings offset from the old (similar to the boundary-checking app covered in Chapter 18). Figure 23-17 provides the blocks for detecting acceleration using the calibrated readings.

					These blocks will be triggered if the device is moved. They check the new accelerometer readings to see if they are significantly different (within 3) of those taken when the phone was lying flat. Suppose that our calibration step had put a 9.0 in <span class="code">ZCalibText</span>. If you slowly lift the phone, the new readings will remain close to 9, and no change will be reported. But if you rapidly lift the phone, the reading will become significantly higher, and the blocks will report a change.

					<span class="first_sentence">Sensors are of great interest in mobile apps because they allow your users to truly interact with their environments.</span> By taking computing mobile, you are opening up (almost literally) a whole world of opportunities in user experiences and app devel- opment. However, you&rsquo;ll need to think carefully about how, where, and when you use sensors in your apps. Many people have privacy concerns, and they might not use your app if they&rsquo;re worried about what you&rsquo;re doing with their sensor data. But with all the options in games, social networking, travel, and more, the possibilities for positive implementations are nearly endless.
