						language at Bell Labs (Brian is now a visiting scholar at Google
						working on the App Inventor team!). With App Inventor, even the
						simplest apps do more than just show messages: they play sounds
						and react when you touch the phone. So we’re going to get started
						right away with something more exciting; your first app (as shown
						in Figure 1-1) will be “HelloPurr,” a picture of a cat that meows
						when you touch it and purrs when you shake it.

				<h3>The App Inventor Environment</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="first-sentence"> You can set up App Inventor
						using the instructions at <span class="url">http://appinventor.googlelabs
							.com/learn/setup/ </span>.
					</span> App Inventor runs primarily through the browser, but you need to
					download some software to your computer’s desktop and change some
					settings on your phone. Typically you can get set up in just a few
					minutes, though sometimes there are issues with setting up device
					drivers for particular Android phones. If you have any phone
					issues, we suggest you get started using the Android emulator that
					comes packaged with the App Inventor download.
				</p>
				<p>The App Inventor programming environment has three key parts,
					all shown in Figure 1-2:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The <span class="new_term">Component Designer</span>,
						shown on the left side of Figure 1-2, runs in your browser window.
						You use it to select components for your app and specify their
						properties.
					</li>
					<li>The <span class="new_term">Blocks Editor</span> runs in a
						window separate from the Component Designer—it is often easiest to
						arrange this to the right of the Component Designer on your screen
						while you are working on your app. You use the Blocks Editor to
						create behaviors for the components.
					</li>
					<li>A phone allows you to actually run and test your app as
						you are developing it. If you don’t have an Android phone handy,
						you can test the apps you build using the Android emulator (shown
						in the bottom right of Figure 1-2) that comes integrated with the
						system.</li>
				</ul>
				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/appinventor/images/figure_1_2.png">

						Editor, and Android emulator</figcaption>

				<div class="pagebreak">
					<span class="pageNumber"> 3 </span> Designing the Components
				</div>
				<p>
					You start App Inventor by browsing to <span class="url">http://appinventor.googlelabs.com.</span>
					If this is the first time you’ve used App Inventor, you’ll see the
					Projects page, which will be mostly blank because you haven’t
					created any projects yet. To create a project, click New at the top
					left of the page, enter the project name “HelloPurr” (one word with
					no spaces), and click OK.
				</p>
				<p>The first window that opens is the Component Designer. When
					it appears, click Open Blocks Editor in the menu at the top right.
					The Blocks Editor comes up in a separate window, aided by a tool
					called Java Web Start. (You don’t have to worry about all the Java
					messages—App Inventor is using Java, which should already be
					installed on your computer, to help launch the Blocks Editor.) This
					process usually takes about 30 seconds.</p>
				<p>If everything is OK, the Blocks Editor will appear and you’ll
					see two buttons near the top right of the screen, as shown in
					Figure 1-3.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/appinventor/images/figure_1_3.png">
					<figcaption>Figure 1-3. Plug a phone into your
						computer or click “New emulator”; then, click “Connect to Device”
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>If you have an Android phone and a USB cable, plug the phone
					into the computer and select “Connect to Device.” If instead you
					want to test the apps you build using an emulator, click “New
					emulator” and wait about 30 seconds while the Android emulator
					loads. When it is fully operational, click “Connect to Device” so
					that App Inventor will run your app in the emulator.</p>
				<p>
					If all is well, you should see a window for the Component Designer,
					a window for the Blocks Editor, and the emulator window if you
					chose that option (your screen should look something like Figure
					1-2, shown previously, but with the windows mostly empty). If
					you’re having problems here, review the setup instructions at <span
						class="url">http://app inventor.googlelabs.com/learn/setup/</span>.

				<h3>Designing the Components</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="first-sentence"> The first tool you’ll use is
						the Component Designer (or just <span class="new_term">
							Designer</span>).
					</span> Components are the elements you combine to create apps, like
					ingredients in a recipe. Some components are very simple, like a <span
						class="code">Label</span> component, which shows text on the
					screen, or a Button component, which you tap to initiate an action.
					Other components are more elaborate: a drawing Canvas that can hold
					still images or animations; an accelerometer, a motion sensor that
					works like a Wii controller and detects when you move or shake the
					phone; or components that make or send text messages, play music
					and video, get information from websites, and so on.
				</p>
				<div class="pagebreak">
					<span class="pageNumber"> 4 </span> Chapter 1: Hello Purr
				</div>
				<p>When you open the Designer, it will appear as shown in Figure
					1-4.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/appinventor/images/figure_1_4.png">
					<figcaption>Figure 1-4. The App Inventor Component
						Designer</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>The Designer is divided into several areas:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Toward the center is a white area called the <span
						class="new_term">Viewer</span>. This is where you place components
						and arrange them to map out what you want your app to look like.
						The Viewer shows only a rough indication of how the app will look,
						so, for example, a line of text might break at a different place
						in your app than what you see in the Viewer. To see how your app
						will <span class="emph">really</span> appear, you’ll need to
						either download the app to your phone (we’ll go through how to do
						this a bit later, in the section “Packaging the App for
						Downloading”) or view it in the emulator that comes with App
						Inventor.
					</li>
					<li>To the left of the Viewer is the <span class="new_term">Palette</span>,
						which is a list of components you can select from. The Palette is
						divided into sections; at this point, only the Basic components
						are visible, but you can see components in other sections of the
						Palette by clicking the headers labeled Media, Animation, and so
						on.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="pagebreak">
					<span class="pageNumber"> 5 </span> Designing the Components
				</div>
				<ul class="clear">
					<li>To the right of the Viewer is the <span class="new_term">Components
					</span> list, which lists the components in your project. Any component
						that you drag into the Viewer will show up in this list.
						Currently, the project has only one component <span class="code">Screen1</span>,
						which represents the phone screen itself.
					</li>
					<li>Under the Components list is an area that shows the Media
						(pictures and sound) in the project. This project doesn’t have any
						media yet, but you’ll be adding some soon.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					At the far right is a section that shows the <span class="new_term">Properties</span>
					of components; when you click a component in the Viewer, you’ll see
					its Properties listed here. Properties are details about each
					component that you can change. (For example, when clicking on a <span
						class="code">Label</span> component, you might see properties
					related to color, text, font, and so on.) Right now, it shows the
					properties of the screen (called <span class="code">Screen1</span>),
					which include a background color, a background image, and a title.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the HelloPurr app, you’ll need two <span class="new_term">visible</span>
					components (you can think of these as components you can actually
					see in the app): the <span class="code">Label</span> component
					reading “Pet the Kitty” and a Button component with an image of a
					cat in it. You’ll also need a non-visible Sound component that
					knows how to play sounds, such as “meow,” and an <span class="code">Accelerometer</span>
					component for detecting when the phone is being shaken. Don’t
					worry—we’ll walk you through each component step by step.

					<ol>
						<li>
							<!-- 1 --> Go to the Palette, click <span class="code">Label</span>

							on the Viewer, with the words “Text for Label1.”
						</li>
						<li>
							<!-- 2 --> Look at the Properties box on the right side of the

						</li>
						<li>
							<!-- 3 --> Change the <span class="code">BackgroundColor</span>

					<p>Be sure you have your phone connected and the Blocks Editor

						phone as you pick the components in the Designer. That way, you
						can see right away how your application will look. This is called
						live testing, and it also applies to the behaviors you create for
						the components in the Blocks Editor, as you’ll see shortly.</p>

				<section class="subsection" id="adding_the_button" data-number="5"
					data-name="Adding the Button">
					<h4>Adding the Button</h4>
					<p>
						<span class="first-sentence">The kitty for HelloPurr is
							implemented as a <span class="code">Button</span> component—you
							create a normal button, and then change the button image to the
							kitty.
						</span>To make the basic button first, go to the Palette in the Designer
						and click <span class="code">Button</span> (at the top of the list
						of components). Drag it onto the Viewer, placing it below the
						label. You’ll see a rectangular button appear on the Viewer. After
						about 10 seconds, the button should appear on the phone. Go ahead
						and tap the phone button—do you think anything will happen? It
						won’t, because your app hasn’t told the button to do anything yet.
						This is the first important point to understand about App
						Inventor: for every component you add in the Designer, you have to
						move over to the Blocks Editor and create the code to make
						something happen with that component (we’ll do that after we
						finish adding the components we need in the Designer).
					</p>
					<p>Now we’ve got a button that we’ll use to trigger the sound
						effect when someone clicks it, but we really want it to look like
						the picture of the kitty, not a plain old rectangle. To make the
						button look like the kitty:</p>
					<div class="pagebreak">
						<span class="pageNumber"> 7 </span> Designing the Components
					</div>
					<div class="clear" />
					<ol>
						<li>
							<!-- 1 --> First, you need to download a picture of the kitty and
							save it on your computer desktop. You can download it from the
							site for this book at <span class="url">http://examples
								.oreilly.com/0636920016632/</span>. The picture is the file called <span
							class="file_path_name">kitty.png.</span> (<span
							class="file_path_name">.png</span> is a standard image format
							similar to <span class="file_path_name">.jpg</span> and <span
							class="file_path_name">.gif</span>; all of these file types will
							work in App Inventor, as will most standard sound files like .mpg
							or .mp3.) You can also download the sound file we need, <span
							class="file_path_name">meow.mp3</span>.
						</li>
						<li>
							<!-- 2 --> The Properties box should show the properties of the
							button. If it doesn’t, click the image of the button in the
							Viewer to expose the button’s properties on the right. In the
							Properties box, click the area under Image (which currently reads
							None). A box appears with a button marked Add.
						</li>
						<li>
							<!-- 3 --> Click Add and you’ll see “Upload file.” Click Choose
							File, browse to select the <span class="file_path_name">kitty.png</span>
							file you downloaded to your computer earlier, and click OK.
						</li>
						<li>
							<!-- 4 --> You’ll see a yellow message at the top of the screen:
							“Uploading kitty.png to the AppInventor server.” After about 30
							seconds, the message and the upload box will disappear, and <span
							class="file_path_name">kitty.png</span> should be listed as the
							image property for the button. You’ll also see this listed in the
							Media area of the Designer window, just below the Components
							list. And if you look at the phone, you’ll see the kitty picture
							displayed—the button now looks like a kitty.
						</li>
						<li>
							<!-- 5 --> You may have also noticed that the kitty picture on
							your phone has the words “Text for button 1” displayed on it. You
							probably don’t want that in your app, so go ahead and change the
							<span class="code">Text</span> property of <span class="code">Button1</span>
							to something like “Pet the Kitty,” or just delete the text
							altogether.

				<p>
					<span class="first-sentence"> App Inventor is a <span
						class="new_term">cloud computing</span> tool, meaning your app is
						stored on Google’s online servers as you work.
					</span> So if you close App Inventor, your app will be there when you
					return; you don’t have to save anything on your computer as you
					would with a Word file or a music track. This also allows you to
					easily test the app while connected to your phone (what we call <span
						class="new_term">live testing</span>), without having to download
					anything to your phone, either. The only problem is that if you
					disconnect your phone from App Inventor, the app running on the
					phone will stop, and you won’t find an icon for it anywhere because
					it was never truly installed.
				</p>
				<p>You can package up and install the completed app so that it
					works on any phone, even when it’s not connected to the computer.
					First, make sure your phone allows apps to be downloaded from
					places other than the Android Market. Typically, you do this by
					going to Settings→Applications on your phone and checking the box
					next to “Unknown sources.” Then, go to back into the Designer in
					App Inventor, click “Package for Phone,” and select “Download to
					Connected Phone.” You should see the messages “Saving” and then
					“Packaging,” a process that takes up to a minute. After the
					“Packaging” message disappears, continue to wait for another 10–15
					seconds while the finished app is downloaded to the phone. You’ll
					get a download confirmation when everything is complete.</p>
				<p>Once you’ve downloaded it, look at the apps available on your
					phone, and you’ll now see HelloPurr, the app we just built. You run
					it just like any other app. (Make sure that you run your new app,
					not the App Inventor Phone application.) You can now unplug or even
					reboot the phone and kill all applications, and your new packaged
					application will still be there.</p>
				<p>It’s important to understand that this means your packaged
					app is now separate from the project on App Inventor. You can do
					more work on the project in App Inventor by connecting the phone
					with the USB cable as before. But that won’t</p>

				make further changes to your app in App Inventor, you’ll want to
				package the result and download the new version to replace the old
				one on the phone.
				<p></p>
				<p>Go ahead and package your HelloPurr app so you have it on
					your phone. Once you’ve done this, you can share it with your
					family and friends, too!</p>

				<h3>Sharing the App</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="first-sentence"> You can share your app in a
						couple of ways. </span> To share the executable app, first click “Package
					for Phone” and choose “Download to this Computer.” This will create
					a file with a <span class="file_path_name">.apk</span> extension on
					your computer. You need to upload this file so that it is
					accessible on the Web. Once the app is on the Web, other people can
					install it on their phones by opening the phone’s browser and
					downloading it. Just let them know they need to allow “unknown
					sources” in their phone’s Application settings in order to install
					apps that aren’t from the Android Market.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can also share the <span class="new_term">source code</span>
					(blocks) of your app with another App Inventor developer. To do
					this, click My Projects, check the app you want to share (in this
					case, HelloPurr), and select More Actions→Download Source. The file
					created on your computer will have a <span class="file_path_name">.zip</span>
					extension. You can email this file to someone, and she can open App
					Inventor, choose More Actions→Upload Source, and select the <span
						class="file_path_name">.zip</span> file. This will give the user
					her own complete copy of your app, which she can then edit and
					customize without affecting your version.
				</p>
				<p>The process of sharing apps will soon be easier and more
					fun—work is currently underway on a community sharing site.</p>

				<h3>Variations</h3>

					<span class="first-sentence"> Now that you’ve built a
						complete app and had the chance to play with it (and maybe
						download it to share with other people), you might have noticed a
						couple of things.</span> Take a look at the following items and consider
					how you’d address them in your app. As you’ll likely soon discover,
					you’ll often build an app, find ways to improve and change it, and
					then go back into it to program those new ideas. Don’t worry,
					that’s a good thing—it means you’re on your way to becoming a
					full-fledged app developer!

				<ul>
					<li>As you shake the phone, the meows will sound strange, as
						if they are echoing. That’s because the accelerometer sensor is
						triggering the shaking event many times a second, so the meows are
						overlapping. If you look at the Sound com- ponent in the Designer,
						you’ll see a property called <span class="code">Minimum
							interval</span>. That determines how close together successive sounds
						can start. It’s currently set at a half-second (500 milliseconds),
						which is less than the duration of a single meow. By playing with
						the minimum interval, you can change how much the meows overlap.

					<li class="clear">If you run the packaged app and walk around
						with the phone in your pocket, your phone will meow every time you
						move suddenly—something you might find embarrassing. Android apps
						are typically designed to keep running even when you’re not
						looking at them; your app continues to communicate with the
						accelerometer and the meow just keeps going. To really quit the
						app, bring up HelloPurr and press the phone’s menu button. You’ll
						be offered an option to stop the application.</li>

				<h3>Summary</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="first-sentence">Here are some of the concepts
						we’ve covered in this chapter:</span>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You build apps by selecting components in the Designer and
						then telling them what to do and when to do it in the Blocks
						Editor.</li>
					<li>Some components are visible and some aren’t. The visible
						ones appear in the user interface of the app. The non-visible ones
						do things like play sounds.</li>
					<li>You define components’ behavior by assembling blocks in
						the Blocks Editor. You first drag out an event handler like <span
						class="program_block">Button1.Click</span>, and then place command
						blocks like <span class="program_block">Sound.Play</span> within
						it. Any blocks within <span class="program_block">Button1.Click</span>
						will be per- formed when the user clicks the button.
					</li>
					<li>Some commands need extra information to make them work. An
						example is <span class="code">Vibrate</span>, which needs to know
						how many milliseconds to vibrate. These values are called
						arguments.
					</li>
					<li>Numbers are represented as number blocks. You can plug
						these into commands that take numbers as arguments.</li>
					<li>App Inventor has sensor components. The <span class="code">AccelerometerSensor</span>
						can detect when the phone is moved.
					</li>
					<li>You can package the apps you build and download them to
						the phone, where they run independently of App Inventor.</li>
