	  					This section is organized by concept, like a traditional programming textbook. You’ll get an overview of app architecture, then delve into programming topics, including variables, animation, conditional statements, lists, iteration, procedures, databases, sensors, APIs, and software engineering and debugging. You can refer to these chap- ters as needed during your app building, or use them for conceptual study as you ride the bus or relax at night.

Creating a fully functioning map app might seem really complicated, but App Inventor lets you use the ActivityStarter component to launch Google Maps for each virtual location. First, you’ll build an app that launches maps for the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and Notre Dame Cathedral with a single click. Then you’ll modify the app to create a virtual tour of satellite maps that are also available from Google Maps.

			  			Many people can tell you what an app is from a user’s perspective, but understand- ing what it is from a programmer’s perspective is more complicated. Apps have an internal structure that we must fully understand in order to create them effectively.
			  		</p>
			  		<p>
			  			One way to describe an app’s internals is to break it into two parts, its <span class="new_term">components</span> and its <span class="new_term">behaviors</span>. Roughly, these correspond to the two main windows you use in App Inventor: you use the Component Designer to specify the objects (components) of the app, and you use the Blocks Editor to program how the app responds to user and external events (the app’s behavior).
			  		</p>
			  		<p>
			  			Figure 14-1 provides an overview of this app architecture. In this chapter, we’ll explore this architecture in detail.

	  			<h4>Components</h4>
	  			<p>
	  				<span class="first_sentence">There are two main types of components in an app: visible and non-visible.</span> The app’s visible components are the ones you can see when the app is launched—things like buttons, text boxes, and labels. These are often referred to as the app’s <span class="new_term">user interface</span>.
	  			</p>
	  			<p>
	  				Non-visible components are those you can’t see, so they’re not part of the user in- terface. Instead, they provide access to the built-in functionality of the device; for ex- ample, the <span class="code">Texting</span> component sends and processes SMS texts, the <span class="code">LocationSensor</span> component determines the device’s location, and the <span class="code">TextToSpeech</span> component talks. The non-visible components are the technology within the device—little people that do jobs for your app.
	  			</p>
	  			<p>
	  				Both visible and non-visible components are defined by a set of properties. <span class="new_term">Properties</span> are memory slots for storing information about the component. Visible components, for instance, have properties like <span class="code">Width</span>, <span class="code">Height</span>, and <span class="code">Alignment</span>, which together define how the component looks. So a button that looks like the Submit button in Figure 14-2 to the end user is defined in the Component Designer with a set of prop- erties, including those shown in Table 14-1.

			  		You can think of properties as something like the cells you see in a spreadsheet. You modify them in the Component Designer to define the <span class="new_term">initial</span> appearance of a com- ponent. If you change the number in the <span class="code">Width</span> slot from 50 to 70, the button will appear wider, both in the Designer and in the app. Note that the end user of the app doesn’t see the 70; he just sees the button’s width change.

	  			<h3>Behavior</h3>
	  			<p>
	  				<span class="first_sentence">An app’s components are generally straightforward to understand: a text box is for entering information, a button is for clicking, and so on. An app’s behavior, on the other hand, is conceptually difficult and often complex.</span> The behavior defines how the app should respond to events, both user initiated (e.g., a button click) and exter- nal (e.g., an SMS text arriving to the phone). The difficulty of specifying such interac- tive behavior is why programming is so challenging.
	  			</p>
	  			<p>
	  				Fortunately, App Inventor provides a visual “blocks” language perfectly suited for specifying behaviors. This section provides a model for understanding it.

		  					<span class="first_sentence">Traditionally, software has often been compared to a recipe. Like a recipe, a traditional app follows a linear sequence of instructions, such as those shown in Figure 14-3, that the computer (chef ) should perform.</span>

	  				<p>
	  					<span class="first_sentence">However, most apps today, whether they’re for mobile phones, the Web, or desktop computers, don’t fit the recipe paradigm anymore.</span> They don’t perform a bunch of instructions in a predetermined order; instead, they react to events—most commonly, events initiated by the app’s end user. For example, if the user clicks a button, the app responds by performing some operation (e.g., sending a text message). For touchscreen phones and devices, the act of dragging your finger across the screen is another event. The app might respond to that event by drawing a line from the point of your original touch to the point where you lifted your finger.
	  				</p>
	  				<p>
	  					These types of apps are better conceptualized as a set of components that respond to events. The apps do include “recipes”—sequences of instructions—but each recipe is only performed in response to some event, as shown in Figure 14-4.

			  	</figure>
			  	<p>
			  		So, as events occur, the app reacts by calling a sequence of <span class="new_term">functions</span>. Functions are things you can do to or with a component—operations like sending an SMS text, or property-changing operations such as changing the text in a label of the user inter- face. To <span class="new_term">call</span> a function means to <span class="new_term">invoke</span> it, to make it happen. We call an event and the set of functions performed in response to it an <span class="new_term">event handler</span>.
			  	</p>
			  	<p>
			  		Many events are initiated by the end user, but some are not. An app can react to events that happen within the phone, such as changes to its orientation sensor and the clock (i.e., the passing of time), and events created by things outside the phone, such as other phones or data arriving from the Web, as shown in Figure 14-5.

			  		One reason App Inventor programming is intuitive is that it’s based directly on this event-response paradigm; event handlers are primary “words” in the language (in many languages, this is not the case). You begin defining a behavior by dragging out an event block, which has the form, “When &ltevent&gt do”. For example, consider an app, SpeakIt, that responds to button clicks by speaking the text the user has entered aloud. This application could be programmed with a single event handler, shown in Figure 14-6. 
			  	</p>
			  	<figure class="centered">
			  		<img src="/contents/appinventor/images/figure_14_6.png">
						<figcaption>
							Figure 14-6. An event handler for a SpeakIt app
						</figcaption>
			  	</figure>
			  	<p>
			  		These blocks specify that when the user clicks the button named <span class="code">SpeakItButton</span>, the <span class="code">TextToSpeech</span> component should speak the words the user has entered in the text box named <span class="code">TextBox1</span>. The response is the call to the function <span class="program_block">TextToSpeech1.Speak</span>. The event is <span class="program_block">SpeakItButton.Click</span>. The event handler includes all the blocks in Figure 14-6.
			  	</p>
			  	<p>
			  		With App Inventor, all activity occurs in response to an event. Your app shouldn’t con- tain blocks outside of an event’s “when-do” block. For instance, the blocks in Figure 14-7 don’t make sense floating alone.

			  				Event-handling languages like App Inventor consider the app’s launch as an event. If you want specific functions to be performed immediately when the app opens, you drag out a <span class="program_block">Screen1.Initialize</span> event block and place some function call blocks within it.

	  					<span class="first_sentence">Because an event handler executes blocks, it often needs to keep track of information.</span> Information can be stored in memory slots called <span class="new_term">variables</span>, which you define in the Blocks Editor. Variables are like component properties, but they’re not associated with any particular component. In a game app, for example, you can define a variable called “score” and your event handlers would modify its value when the user does something accordingly. Variables store data temporarily while an app is running; when you close the app, the data is no longer available.
	  				</p>
	  				<p>
	  					Sometimes your app needs to remember things not just while it runs, but even when it is closed and then reopened. If you tracked a high score for the history of a game, for example, you’d need to store this data long-term so it is available the next time someone plays the game. Data that is retained even after an app is closed is called <span class="new_term">persistent data</span>, and it’s stored in some type of a database.

With App Inventor, you design how an app looks and then you design its behavior—the set of event handlers that make an app behave as you want. You build these event handlers by assembling and configuring blocks representing events, functions, conditional branches, repeat loops, web calls, database operations, and more, and then test your work by actually running the app on your phone. After you write a few programs, the mapping between the internal structure of an app and its physical appearance becomes clear. When that happens, you’re a programmer!
