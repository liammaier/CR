						<span class="first_sentence">Mobile technology and the
							ubiquitous nature of the Web have changed the world we live in.</span>
						You can now sit in the park and do your banking, search Amazon.com
						to find reviews of the book you&#39;re reading, and check Twitter
						to see what people in every other park in the world are thinking
						about. Mobile phones have moved well past just calling and
						texting&#8212;now you have instant access to the world&#39;s data,
						too.
					</p>
					<p>You can use your phone&#39;s browser to reach the Web, but
						often the small screen and limited speed of a mobile device can
						make this prob- lematic. Custom apps, specially designed to pull
						in small chunks of particularly suitable in- formation from the
						Web, can provide a more attractive alternative to the mobile
						browser.</p>
					<p>
						In this chapter, we&#39;ll take a broader look at apps that source
						information from the Web. You&#39;ll start by creating an app that
						asks a website to generate a bar chart (image) of a game
						player&#39;s scores for display. Then we&#39;ll discuss how <span
							class="code">TinyWebDB</span> can be used to access any type of
						data (not just images) from the Web, and we&#39;ll provide a
						sample that accesses stock data from Yahoo! Finance. Finally,
						we&#39;ll discuss how you can create your own web information
						sources that can be used by App Inventor apps.

					Creativity is about remixing the world, combining (<span
						class="new_term">mashing</span>) old ideas and content in
					interesting new ways. Eminem popularized the music <span
						class="new_term">mashup</span> when he set his Slim Shady vocal
					over AC/DC and Vanilla Ice tracks. This kind of
					&#8220;sampling&rdquo; is now common, and numerous
					artists&mdash;including Girl Talk and Negativland&mdash;focus
					primarily on creating new tracks from mashing old content.

				<div class="pagebreak">

				</div>
				<p>
					The web and mobile world are no different: websites and apps remix
					content from various data sources, and most sites are now designed
					with such <span class="new_term">interoperability</span> in mind.
					An illustrative example of a web mashup is Housing Maps (<span
						class="url">http://www. housingmaps.com</span>), pictured in
					Figure 24-1, which takes apartment rental information from
					Craigslist (<span class="url">http://www.craigslist.org</span>) and
					mashes it with the Google Maps API.
				</p>
				<figure class="centered">
					<img id="figure_24_1"
						src="/contents/appinventor/images/figure_24_1.png" alt="">
					<figcaption>Figure 24-1. Housing Maps mashes
						information from Craigslist and Google Maps</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					Mashups like Housing Maps are possible because services like Google
					Maps provide both a website and a corresponding <span
						class="new_term">web service API</span>. We humans visit <span
						class="new_term">http://maps.google.com/</span> in a browser, but
					apps like Housing Maps communicate machine to machine with the
					Google Maps API. Mashups process the data, combine it with data
					from other sites (e.g., Craigslist), and then present it in new and
					interesting ways.
				</p>
				<p>
					Just about every popular website now provides this alternative,
					machine-to-machine access. The program providing the data is called
					a <span class="new_term">web service</span>, and the protocol for
					how a <span class="new_term">client</span> app should communicate
					with the service is called an <span class="new_term">application
						programmer interface</span>, or API. In practice, the term <span
						class="new_term">API</span> is used to refer to the web service as
					well.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Amazon Web Service (AWS) was one of the first web services, as
					Amazon realized that opening its data for use by third-party
					entities would eventually lead to more books being sold. When
					Facebook launched its API in 2007, many people raised their
					eyebrows. Facebook&#39;s data isn&#39;t book advertisements, so why
					should it let other apps &ldquo;steal&rdquo; that data and
					potentially draw many users away from the Facebook site (and its
					advertisements!). But its openness led Facebook toward becoming a <span
						class="new_term">platform</span> instead of just a
					site&mdash;meaning that other programs, like FarmVille, could build
					on and tap into Facebook&#39;s functionality&mdash;and no one can
					argue with its success today. By the time Twitter launched in 2009,
					API access was an expectation, not a novelty, and Twitter acted
					accordingly. Now, as shown in Figure 24-2, most websites offer both
					an API and a human interface.

				</figure>
				<p>So the Web is one thing to us average humans&mdash;a
					collection of sites to visit. To programmers, it is the world&#39;s
					largest and most diverse database of information.
					Machine-to-machine communication is now poised to outpace
					human&#8212;machine communication on the Web!</p>

				<h4>Talking to Web APIs That Generate Images</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="first_sentence">As we saw in Chapter 13
						(&ldquo;Amazon at the Bookstore&rdquo;), most APIs accept requests
						in the form of a URL and return data (typically in standard
						formats like XML, or Extensible Markup Language; and JSON,
						JavaScript Object Notation).</span> For these APIs, you use the <span
						class="code">TinyWebDB</span> component to communicate, a topic
					we&#39;ll discuss in greater detail later in the chapter.
				</p>
				<p>Some APIs, however, don&#39;t return data; they return a
					picture. In this section, we&#39;ll dis- cuss how you can
					communicate with these image-generating APIs in order to extend App
					Inventor&#39;s user interface capabilities.</p>
				<p>The Google Chart API is such a service. Your app can send it
					some data within a URL, and it will send back a chart that you can
					display in your app. The service creates many types of charts,
					including bar charts, pie charts, maps, and Venn diagrams. The
					Chart API is a great example of an interoperable web service whose
					purpose is to enhance the capabilities of other sites. Since App
					Inventor doesn&#39;t provide much in terms of visualization
					components, the ability to leverage a service like the Chart API is
					crucial.</p>
				<div class="pagebreak">
					<span class="pageNumber"> 336 </span> Chapter 24: Communicating
					with Web APIs
				</div>
				<p>
					The first thing to do is to understand the format of the URL you
					should send to the API. If you go to the Google Chart API site (<span
						class="code">http://code.google.com/apis/chart</span>), you will
					see the overview shown in Figure 24-3.
				</p>
				<figure class="centered">
					<img id="figure_24_3"
						src="/contents/appinventor/images/figure_24_3.png" alt="">
					<figcaption>Figure 24-3. The Google Chart API
						generates numerous types of charts</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>The site includes complete documentation and a wizard to
					interactively create charts and explore how to build the URLs. The
					wizard is especially helpful, because you can use a form to specify
					the kind of chart you want and then examine the URL that the wizard
					generates to reverse-engineer what you want to send it for your
					specific data.</p>
				<p>Go ahead and play around with the website and the wizard and
					build some charts, and then take a look at the details of the URLs
					used to build them. For example, if you enter the following URL in
					a browser:</p>
				<div class="indented">
					<p class="code">
						http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=bvg&chxt=y&chbh=a&chs=300x225&chco=
						A2C180&chtt=Vertical+bar+chart&chd=t:10,50,60,80,40,60,30</p>
				</div>
				you&#39;ll get the chart shown in Figure 24-4.
				<p></p>

					<figcaption>Figure 24-4. Google&#39;s Chart API
						generates this chart from the URL</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					To understand the rather complicated-looking URL specified
					previously, you need to understand how URLs work. In your browsing
					experience, you&#39;ve probably noticed URLs with question marks
					(?) and ampersands (&). The ? character specifies that the first
					parameter of the URL request is coming. The & character then
					separates each succeeding parameter. Each parameter has a name, an
					equals sign, and a value. So the sample URL is calling the Chart
					API (<span class="url">http://chart.apis.google.com/chart</span>)
					with the parameters listed in Table 24-1.
				</p>
				<figcaption>Table 24-1. The Chart API utilizes a URL
					with these parameters</figcaption>

				<h4>Building a Chart API URL Dynamically</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="first_sentence">The preceding example shows how
						you can get a generated chart in your app, but it uses a URL with
						fixed data (10,50,60,80,40,60,30).</span> Generally, you&#39;ll show <span
						class="new_term">dynamic</span> data in your chart&mdash;that is,
					data stored in your variables. For example, in a game app, you
					might show the user&#39;s previous scores, which are stored in a
					variable <span class="code">Scores</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					To create such a dynamic chart, you must <span class="new_term">build</span>
					the URL for the Chart API and load your variable data into it. In
					the sample URL, the data for the chart is fixed and specified in
					the parameter <span class="code">chd</span> (<span class="code">chd</span>
					stands for chart data):
				</p>
				<p class="code">chd=t:10,50,60,80,40,60,30</p>
				<p>
					To build your scores chart dynamically, you&#39;ll start with the
					fixed part, <span class="code">chd=t:</span>, and then step through
					the <span class="code">Scores</span> list, concatenating each score
					to the text (along with a comma). Figure 24-7 shows a complete
					solution.

				<p>Let&#39;s examine the blocks more closely, because
					there&#39;s a lot going on in here, much of which we&#39;ve covered
					in previous chapters. To understand such code, it&#39;s important
					to envision some real data. So let&#39;s assume the user has played
					three games in this app and that the variable Scores has three
					items: 11, 22, and 15.</p>
				<p>
					The blocks in Figure 24-8 define a variable <span class="code">chdParam</span>
					to store the part of the URL that will contain the <span
						class="code">chd</span> data. The first row of blocks initializes
					the text of the <span class="code">chdParam</span> from the list of
					<span class="code">Scores</span>.

				<figure class="centered">
					<img src="/contents/appinventor/images/figure_24_8.png" alt="">
					<figcaption>Figure 24-8. Beginning the chd parameter
						with &ldquo;chd=t:&rdquo; and the first score</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					After these blocks are performed, <span class="code">chdParam</span>
					will contain <span class="code">chd=t:11</span>, as <span
						class="code">11</span> is the first value of the <span
						class="code">Scores</span> list.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next set of blocks, shown in Figure 24-9, adds the rest of the
					scores to the <span class="code">chdParam</span>.
				</p>
				<figure class="centered">
					<img src="/contents/appinventor/images/figure_24_9.png" alt="">
					<figcaption>Figure 24-9. Adding the successive scores
						to the chdParam variable</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					We use a <span class="program_block">while</span> block in this
					example instead of a <span class="program_block">foreach</span>
					because <span class="program_block">foreach</span> only allows you
					to do the same thing to each item. Here, we want to insert commas
					before the second item and any items that come after it (but not
					the first). With <span class="program_block">while</span>, we can
				</p>
				<div class="pagebreak">
					<span class="pageNumber"> 341 </span> Talking to Web Data APIs
				</div>
				put the first item in (Figure 24-8) and then loop starting from the
				second item, always inserting a comma <span class="emph">before</span>
				the item (make sure not to put a space afterward). For more
				information on <span class="program_block">while</span> and <span
					class="program_block">foreach</span>, see Chapter 20.
				<p></p>
				<p>
					An index is used to keep track of where we are in the <span
						class="code">Scores</span> list. On each iteration, <span
						class="program_block">make text</span> adds a comma and the next
					item in <span class="code">Scores</span>. After these blocks are
					performed, the <span class="code">chdParam</span> will contain <span
						class="code">chd=t:11,22,15</span>. We have built the <span
						class="code">chd</span> parameter dynamically! (And we&#39;ve also
					built it so that if more scores are added beyond these first three,
					it will still work.)
				</p>
				<p>
					The blocks&rsquo; last job is to concatenate the <span class="code">chd</span>
					parameter with the rest of the Chart API URL, as shown in Figure
					24-10.
				</p>
				<figure class="centered">

					<figcaption>Figure 24-10. Setting the picture to the
						full URL, including the chd parameter just built</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					The blocks set the <span class="code">ScoreChartImage.Picture</span>
					property to this full URL: <span class="url">http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=bvg&chxt=y&chbh=a&chs=300x225&chco=A2C180&chtt=Game+Scores&chd=t:11,22,15</span>.

					You could add such a display to any game or app by adding blocks

					</span> There is only one property associated with <span class="code">TinyWebDB</span>,
					its <span class="code">ServiceURL</span>, shown in Figure 24-13. By

					call to request data from the site. You might do this in response
					to the user entering a stock symbol and clicking a Submit button in
					your app&#39;s UI, or you might do it in the <span

					information about a particular stock right when the app is opened.
					In any case, when you call <span class="program_block">GetValue</span>,
					you should set the tag to a stock symbol, as illustrated in Figure
					24-14, just as you did at the <span class="url">http://yahoostocks.appspot.com</span>

				<p>
					As we covered in Chapter 10&#39;s MakeQuiz app and in Chapter
					22&#39;s discussion of data- bases, the <span class="code">TinyWebDB</span>
					communication is asynchronous: your app requests the data with <span
						class="program_block">TinyWebDB.GetValue</span> and then goes
					about its business. You must provide a separate event handler, <span
						class="program_block">TinyWebDB.GotValue</span>, to program the
					steps the app should take when the data actually comes back from
					the web service. From our examination of the human interface of <span
						class="url">http://yahoostocks.appspot.com</span>, we learned that
					the data returned from <span class="program_block">GetValue</span>
					is a list, with particular list items representing different data
					about the stock (e.g., item 2 is the latest price).
				</p>

				<h4>Creating Your Own App Inventor&#8212;Compliant APIs</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="first_sentence"><span class="code">TinyWebDB</span>
						is the bridge from an App Inventor app to the Web.</span> It lets App
					Inventor programmers talk to web services with the simple tag-value
					protocol inherent in the <span class="code">GetValue</span>
					function. You send a particular tag as the parameter, and a list or
					text object is returned as the value. In this way, the App Inventor
					programmer is shielded from the difficult programming required to <span
						class="new_term">parse</span> (understand and extract data from)
					standard data formats like XML or JSON.
				</p>
				<p>
					The tradeoff is that App Inventor apps can talk only to web
					services that follow <span class="code">TinyWebDB</span>&rsquo;s
					expected protocol&mdash;it expects data to be returned in a very
					specific way, and the API has to provide its data accordingly. App
					Inventor doesn&#39;t have a component for accessing an arbitrary
					web service that returns standard data formats such as XML or JSON.
					If there isn&#39;t an App Inventor&#8212;compliant API already
					available, someone with the ability to write a web program must
					create it.
				</p>
				<p>In the past, building APIs was difficult because you not only
					needed to understand the programming and web protocols, but you
					also needed to set up a server to host your web service, and a
					database to store the data. Now it&#39;s much easier, as you can
					leverage cloud-computing tools like Google&#39;s App Engine and
					Amazon&#39;s Elastic Compute Cloud to immediately deploy the
					service you create. These platforms will not only host your web
					service, but they&#39;ll also let thousands of users access it
					before charging you a single dime. As you can imagine, these sites
					are a great boon to innovation.</p>

				<h4>Customizing Template Code</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="first_sentence">Writing your own API may seem
						daunting, but the good news is that you don&#39;t need to start
						from scratch.</span> You can leverage some provided template code that
					makes it especially easy to create App Inventor&#8212;compliant
					APIs. The code is written in the Python programming language and
					uses Google&#39;s App Engine. The template pro- vides boilerplate
					code for getting the data into the form that App Inventor needs,
					and a function, <span class="code">get_value</span>, that you can
					customize.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can download the template code and instructions for deploying
					it on Google&#39;s App Engine servers at <span class="url">http://appinventorapi.com/using-tinywebdb-to-talk-to-an-api/</span>.
					You might notice that the link takes you to the same <span
						class="url">appinventorapi.com</span> site that was used in
					Chapter 21 to create a custom web database. Building an API is
					similar, only instead of just storing and retrieving data,
					you&#39;ll call some other service to access the data you need.
				</p>
				<p>
					To create your own web API, you&#39;ll download the template,
					modify a few key places in the code, and then upload it to App
					Engine. Within minutes, you will have your own API that can be
					called using <span class="code">TinyWebDB</span> in an App Inventor
					app.
				</p>
				<div class="pagebreak">
					<span class="pageNumber"> 346 </span> Chapter 24: Communicating
					with Web APIs
				</div>
				<p>Here&#39;s the particular code from the template that
					you&#39;ll need to customize (don&#39;t worry about the text that
					comes after the # symbol; like the comments in App Inventor, it
					just describes what the code following it is doing):</p>

				<pre>def get_value(self, tag):</pre>
				<pre>    #For this simple example, we just return hello:tag, where tag is sent in by client</pre>
				<pre>    <strong>value="hello:"+tag</strong></pre>
				<pre>    <strong>value = "\""+value+"\""</strong> # add quotes if the value is has multiple words</pre>
				<pre>    if self.request.get('fmt') == "html":</pre>
				<pre>        WriteToWeb(self,tag,value )</pre>
				<pre>    else:</pre>
				<pre>        WriteToPhone(self,tag,value)</pre>

				<p>
					This code is for a <span class="new_term">function</span> (same as
					a procedure in App Inventor) called <span class="code">get_value</span>,
					and it&#39;s indeed the code that is invoked when your app calls an
					API with the <span class="program_block">TinyWebDB.GetValue</span>
					function. <span class="code">tag</span> is a <span class="emph">parameter</span>
					of the function and corresponds to the tag you send in the <span
						class="program_block">GetValue</span> call.
				</p>
				<p>
					The bolded code is the part you&#39;ll change. By default, it
					simply takes the tag sent in with the request and sends back
					&ldquo;hello tag.&rdquo; (In other words, if you call this code
					with the tag &ldquo;joe,&rdquo; it returns &ldquo;hello
					joe&rdquo;). It does this by setting the variable <span
						class="code">value</span>, which is then sent to the function <span
						class="code">WriteToWeb</span> if the request came from the Web,
					or <span class="code">WriteToPhone</span> if the request came from
					a phone.
				</p>
				<div class="note">
					<figure class="leftfig">
						<img src="/contents/appinventor/images/note_icon.png" alt="">

					<p>
						<span class="program_block">Note.</span> Even if you&rsquo;ve
						never looked at Python or other programming code, you may find the
						sample above somewhat readable from your experience with App
						Inventor. The &ldquo;def get_value...&rdquo; line defines a
						procedure, the &ldquo;value=...&rdquo; lines are setting the
						variable &ldquo;value&rdquo; to something, and the &ldquo;if..
						&ldquo; statements should look familiar. The fun- damental
						concepts are the same, its just text instead of blocks.
					</p>
					<p></p>
				</div>
				<p>
					To customize the template, you replace the bold code with any
					computation you want, as long as that code places something in the
					variable <span class="code">value</span>. Often, your API will make
					a call to another API (this is called &ldquo;wrapping&rdquo; a
					call&mdash;more specifically, your <span class="code">get_value</span>
					function will make the call to some other API).
				</p>
				<p>Many APIs are complicated, with hundreds of functions and
					complex user authoriza- tion schemes. Others, however, are quite
					simple, and you can even find sample code for accessing them on the
					Web, as you&rsquo;ll see in the next section.</p>

				<h4>Wrapping the Yahoo! Finance API</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="first_sentence">The Yahoo! Stocks API for App
						Inventor used in this chapter was created by modifying the
						template code above with code found through a simple web search.</span>
					As the goal was wrapping the Yahoo! Stocks API for use by App
					Inventor, the developer (Wolber) did a web search for &ldquo;Python
					Yahoo Stocks API&rdquo;. From the site
					http://www.gummy-stuff.org/Yahoo-data.htm, he found that a URL in
					the form:
				</p>
				<p>
					http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?f=sl1d1t1c1ohgv&e=.cs
					v&s=IBM</p>
				<p>would return a text file with a single comma-separated string
					of data. The preceding URL returns this text string:</p>
				<pre>
					<code>
	    "IBM",140.85,"10/15/2010","3:00pm",-0.65,142.10,142.10,140.60,4974553
					</code>
				</pre>
				<p>He then found some Python code for accessing the Yahoo!
					Stocks API at http://www .goldb.org/ystockquote.html. With some
					quick cutting and pasting and a bit of editing, the App Inventor
					wrapper API was created by modifying the template in the following
					manner:</p>
				<pre>
					<code>
	def get_value(self, tag):
	    # Need to generate a string or list and send it to WriteToPhone/WriteToWeb
	    # Multi-word strings should have quotes in front and back
	    # e.g.,
	    #    value = "\""+value+"\""
	    # call the Yahoo Finance API and get a handle to the file that is returned
	    <strong>quoteFile=urllib.urlopen("http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?f=
	    sl1d1t1c1ohgv&e=.csv&s="+tag)</strong>
	    line = quoteFile.readline() # there's only one line
	    splitlist = line.split(",") # split the data into a list
	    # the data has quotes around the items, so eliminate them
	    i=0
	    while i<\len(splitlist):
	        item=splitlist[i]
	        splitlist[i]=item.strip('"') # remove " around strings
	        i=i+1
	    value=splitlist
	    if self.request.get('fmt') == "html":
	        WriteToWeb(self,tag,value )
	    else:
	        WriteToPhone(self,tag,value)
	              	</code>
				</pre>
				<p>
					The bolded code calls the Yahoo! API within the <span class="code">urllib.urlopen</span>
					function call (this is one way to call APIs from the Python
					language). The URL has a parameter, <span class="code">f</span>,
					that specifies the type of stock data you want (this parameter is
					something like the cryptic parameters required by the Google Chart
					API). The data returned from Yahoo! is then put into the variable <span
						class="code">line</span>. The rest of the code splits up the items
					into a list, removes the quotation marks around each item, and
					sends the result to the requester (either the web interface or an
					App Inventor app).

				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>
					<span class="first_sentence">Most websites and many mobile
						apps are not standalone entities; they rely on the in-
						teroperability of other sites to do their jobs.</span> With App Inventor,
					you can build games, quizzes, and other standalone apps, but soon
					enough, you&rsquo;ll encounter issues related to web access. Can I
					write an app that tells me when the next bus will arrive at my
					usual stop? Can I write an app that texts a special subset of my
					Facebook friends? Can I write an app that sends tweets? App
					Inventor provides two hooks to the Web: (1) you can set the <span
						class="code">Image.Picture</span> property to a URL to bring in a
					(generated) image, and (2) you can use <span class="code">TinyWebDB</span>
					to access data in a specially designed web API.
				</p>
				<p>
					App Inventor does not provide arbitrary access to APIs. Instead,
					the system relies on programmers to create &ldquo;wrapper&rdquo;
					APIs that follow a particular protocol. Once created, these APIs
					are available to App Inventor app programmers using the same <span
						class="program_block">TinyWebDB.GetValue</span> scheme they use to
					access databases. Actually writing APIs is certainly a bigger
					hurdle than writing apps in App Inventor, but if you&rsquo;re
					interested in learning how, be sure to check out some Python books
					and courses (O&rsquo;Reilly has a few of those!), and you&rsquo;ll
					be on your way.
