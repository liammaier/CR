			<div class="chapter_description">
				<p>Say you’re browsing books at your favorite bookstore and want to know how much a book costs on 
					Amazon.com. With the “Amazon at the Bookstore” 
					app, you can scan a book or enter an ISBN, and the 
					app will tell you the current lowest price of the book 
					at Amazon.com. You can also search for books on a 
					particular topic.</p>
				
				<p>“Amazon at the Bookstore” demonstrates how App 
					Inventor can be used to create apps that talk to web 
					services (aka APIs, or application programming interfaces). This app will get data from a
					web service created by one of this book’s authors. By the 
					end of this chapter, you’ll be able to create your own custom app for talking to Amazon.</p>
				
				<p>The application has a simple user interface that lets the user enter keywords or a book’s 
					ISBN (international standard book number — a 10- or 13-digit code that uniquely identifies a book)
					and then lists the title, ISBN, and lowest price for a new copy at Amazon. 
					It also uses the <span class="normalFont python">BarcodeScanner</span> component so the user can scan
					a book to trigger a search instead of entering text (technically, the scanner just inputs the book’s ISBN for 
					you!).</p>

			<h3>What You'll Learn</h3>

			<p>In this app (shown in Figure 13-1), you’ll learn: 

			<ul>
				<li>How to use a barcode scanner within an app.</li>
				<li>How to access a web information source (Amazon’s API) through the <span class="python">TinyWebDB</span>
					component.</li>
				<li>How to process complex data returned from that web information source. In particular, you’ll learn
					how to process a list of books in which each book is itself a list of three items (title, price, and ISBN).</li>
			</ul>

		<section class="section" data-number="2" data-name="What Is an API?">

			<h3>What Is an API?</h3>

			<p>Before we start designing our components and programming the app, let’s take a 
				closer look at what an <em>application programmer interface (API)</em> is and how one works. 
				An API is like a website, but instead of communicating with humans, it communicates 
				with other computer programs. APIs are often called “server” programs because they 
				typically serve information to “client” programs that actually interface with humans — like
				an App Inventor app. If you’ve ever used a Facebook app on your phone, you’re 
				using a client program that communicates with the Facebook API server.</p>
			
			<p>In this chapter, you’ll create an Android client app that communicates with an 
				Amazon API. Your app will request book and ISBN information from the Amazon API, 
				and the API will return up-to-date listings to your app. Your app will then present the 
				book data to the user.</p>
			
			<p>The Amazon API you’ll use is specially configured for use with App Inventor. We won’t 
				get into the gory details here, but it’s useful to know that, because of this configuration,
				you can use the <span class="python">TinyWebDB</span> component to communicate with Amazon. The 
				good news is, you already know how to do that! You’ll call <span class="pBlock">TinyWebDB.GetValue</span> to 
				request information and then process the information returned in the <span class="pBlock">TinyWebDB.GotValue</span>
				event handler, just as you do when you use a web database. (You can go 
				back to the MakeText app in Chapter 10 to refresh your memory if needed.)</p>

<!-- Page 205 -->

			<div class="pagebreak">
					<span class="pageNumber"> 205 </span> What Is an API?
			</div>

			<p>Before creating the app, you’ll need to understand the Amazon API’s <em>protocol</em>, which 
				specifies the format for your request and the format of the data returned. Just as 
				different cultures have different protocols (when you meet someone, do you shake 
				hands, bow, or nod your head?), computers talking to one another have protocols 
				as well.</p>

			<p>The Amazon API you’ll be using here provides a web interface for exploring how the 
				API works before you start using it. While the API is designed to talk to other computers,
				this web interface allows you to see just how that communication will happen. 
				Following these steps, you can try out what particular <span class="pBlock">GetValue</span> calls will return via 
				the website, and know that the API interface will behave exactly the same when you 
				ask it for data via the <span class="python">TinyWebDB</span> component in App Inventor:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Open a browser and go to <em>http://aiamazonapi.appspot.com/</em>. You’ll see the 
					website shown in Figure 13-2.</p>

					</figure>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The page allows you to try the one function you can call with this API: <span class="python">getvalue</span>. 
						Enter a term (e.g., “baseball”) in the Tag field and then click “Get value.” The web 
						page will display a listing of the top five books returned from Amazon, as shown 
						in Figure 13-3.

			<ol class="listFormatting">
				<li>
					<p>The value returned is a list of books, each one enclosed in brackets [like this] and 
						providing the title, cost, and ISBN. If you look closely, you’ll see that each book is 
						in fact represented as a sublist of another main list. The main list (about baseball) 
						is enclosed in brackets, and each sublist (or book) is enclosed in its own set of 
						brackets within the main brackets. So the return value from this API is actually a 
						<em>list of lists</em>, with each sublist providing the information for one book. Let’s look at 
						this a bit more closely.

					<p>Each left bracket ([) in the data denotes the beginning of a list. The first left 
						bracket of the result denotes the beginning of the outer list (the list of books). To 
						its immediate right is the beginning of the first sublist, the first book:</p>

					<p class="intendedText python">[“The Baseball Codes: Beanballs, Sign Stealing, and Bench-Clearing Brawls: The 
						Unwritten Rules of America\’s Pastime”, ‘$12.98’, ‘0375424695’]</p>

					<p>The sublist has three parts: a title, the lowest current price for the book at 
						Amazon, and the book’s ISBN. When you get this information into your App 
						Inventor app, you’ll be able to access each part using <span class="pBlock">select list item</span>, with index 
						1 for the title, index 2 for the price, and index 3 for the ISBN. (To refresh your memory
						on working with an index and lists, revisit the MakeQuiz app in Chapter 10.)</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<ol start="3">
				<li>Instead of searching by keyword, you can search for a book by entering an ISBN. 
					To perform such a search, you enter a tag of the form “isbn:xxxxxxxxxxxxx,” as 
					shown in Figure 13-4.

					<p>The double brackets ([[) in the result [['"App Inventor"', '$21.93',
						'1449397484']]denote that a list of lists is still returned, even though there is 
						only one book. It may seem a bit strange now, but this will be important when 
						we access the information for our app.</p>

			<h3>Designing the Components</h3>

			<p>The user interface for our Amazon book app is relatively simple: give it a <span class="python">Textbox</span>
				for entering keywords or ISBNs, two buttons for starting the two types of searches 
				(keyword or ISBN), and a third button for letting the user scan a book (we’ll get to 
				that in a bit). Then, add a heading label and another label for listing the results that 
				the Amazon API will return, and finally two non-visible components: <span class="python">TinyWebDB</span> and 
				a <span class="python">BarcodeScanner</span>. Check your results against Figure 13-5.</p>

			<h3>Designing the Behavior</h3>

			<p>For this app, you’ll specify the following behaviors in the Blocks Editor:

			<p><em>Searching by keyword</em></p>

			<p class="intendedText">The user enters some terms and clicks the <span class="python">KeywordSearchButton</span> to
				invoke an Amazon search. You’ll call <span class="pBlock">TinyWebDB.GetValue</span> to make it happen.</span>

			<p><em>Searching by ISBN</em></p>

			<p class="intendedText">The user enters an ISBN and clicks the ISBNButton. You’ll package
				the prefix “isbn:” with the number entered and run the Amazon search.</span>

			<p><em>Barcode scanning</em></p>

			<p class="intendedText">The user clicks a button and the scanner is launched. When the user
				scans an ISBN from a book, your app will start the Amazon search.</span>

			<p><em>Processing the list of books</em></p>

			<p class="intendedText">At first, your app will display the data returned from Amazon in a
				rudimentary way. Later, you’ll modify the blocks so that the app extracts the title, price,
				and ISBN from each book returned and displays them in an organized way.</span>

				<h4>Searching by Keyword</h4>

				<p>When the user clicks the <span class="python">KeywordSearchButton</span>, you want to grab the text from the 
					<span class="python">SearchTextbox</span> and send it as the tag in your request to the Amazon API. You’ll use 
					the <span class="pBlock">TinyWebDB.GetValue</span> block to request the Amazon search.</p>

				<p>When the results come back from Amazon, the <span class="pBlock">TinyWebDB.GotValue</span> event handler 
					will be triggered. For now, let’s just display the result that is returned directly into 
					the <span class="python">ResultsLabel</span>, as shown in Figure 13-6. Later, after you see that the data is indeed

					<p>When the user clicks the <span class="python">KeywordSearchButton</span>, the

					<p>If you completed the MakeQuiz app (Chapter 10), you know that <span class="pBlock">TinyWebDB.GetValue</span>
						requests are not answered immediately. Instead, when the data arrives 
						from the API, <span class="pBlock">TinyWebDB1.GotValue</span> is triggered. In
						<span class="pBlock">GotValue</span>, the blocks check the 
						value returned to see if it’s a list (it won’t be if the Amazon API is offline or there is no

				<h4>Searching by ISBN</h4>

				<p>The code for searching by ISBN is similar, but in this case the Amazon API expects 
					the tag to be in the form “isbn:xxxxxxxxxxxxx” (this is the <em>protocol</em> the API expects for 
					searching by ISBN). You don’t want to force the user to know this protocol; the user 
					should just be able to enter the ISBN in the text box and click Search by ISBN, and the 
					app will add the “isbn:” prefix behind the scenes with <span class="pBlock">make text</span>. Figure 13-8 shows 
					the blocks to do that.</p>

				<h4>Don't Leave Your Users Hanging</h4>

				<p>As we’ve seen in earlier chapters that work with TinyWebDB, when you call a web 
					service (API) with <span class="pBlock">TinyWebDB.GetValue</span>, there can be a delay before the data arrives 
					and <span class="pBlock">TinyWebDB.GotValue</span> is triggered. It is generally a good idea to let users know 
					the request is being processed so they don’t worry that the app has hung. For this

				<p>Let’s face it: typing on a cell phone isn’t always the easiest thing, and you tend to

				<h4>Improving the Display</h4>

				<p>A client app like the one you’re creating can do whatever it wants with the data it 
					receives — you could compare the price information with that of other online stores, 
					or use the title information to search for similar books from another library.</p> 

				<p>Almost always, you’ll want to get the API information loaded into variables that you 
					can then process further. In the <span class="pBlock">TinyWebDB.GotValue</span> event handler you have so far, 
					you just place all the information returned from Amazon into the <span class="python">ResultsLabel</span>.</p>

				<p>Instead, let’s <em>process</em> (or do something to) the data by (1) putting the title, price, and 
					ISBN of each book returned into separate variables, and (2) displaying those items in 
					an orderly fashion. By now, you’re really getting the hang of creating variables and 
					using them in your display, so try building out the variables you think you’ll need and 
					the blocks to display each search result on its own separate line. Then compare what 
					you’ve done with Figure 13-11.</p>

				<section class="subsection" data-number="14" data-name="How the blocks work">

					<h5>How the blocks work</h5>

					<p>Four variables — <span class="python">resultList</span>, <span class="python">title</span>,
						<span class="python">cost</span>, and <span class="python">isbn</span> — are defined to hold each piece 
						of data as it is returned from the API. The result from the API, <span class="python">valueFromWebDB</span>, is 
						placed into the variable <span class="python">resultList</span>. This app could have processed the argument 
						<span class="python">valueFromWebDB</span> directly, but in general, you’ll put it in a variable in case
						you want to process the data outside the event handler. (Event arguments like
						<span class="python">valueFromWebDB</span> hold their value only within the event handler.)</p>

					<p>A <span class="pBlock">foreach</span> loop is used to iterate through each item of the result.
						Recall that the data returned from Amazon is a list of lists, with each sublist representing the information 
						for a book. So the placeholder of the <span class="pBlock">foreach</span> is named
						<span class="python">bookitem</span>, and it holds the current book information, a list, on each iteration.</p>

					<p>Now we have to deal with the fact that the variable <span class="python">bookitem</span> is a list — the
						first item is the title, the second, the price; and the third, the ISBN. Thus,
						<span class="pBlock">select list item</span> blocks 
						are used to extract these items and place them into their respective variables (<span class="python">title</span>, 
						<span class="python">price</span>, and <span class="python">isbn</span>).</p>

			<h3>Customizing the API</h3>

			<p>The API you connected to, <em>http://aiamazonapi.appspot.com</em>, was created with the 
				programming language Python and Google’s App Engine. App Engine lets you create 
				and deploy websites and services (APIs) that live on Google’s servers. You only pay for 
				App Engine if your site or API becomes very popular (meaning you’re using up a lot 
				more of Google’s servers for it).</p>

			<p>The API service used here provides only partial access to the full Amazon API and returns
				a maximum of five books for any search. If you’d like to provide more flexibility — for example,
				have it search for items other than books — you can download the source 
				code from <em>http://appinventorapi.com/amazon/</em> and customize it.</p>

			<p>Such customization does require knowledge of Python programming, so beware! 
				But if you’ve been completing the App Inventor apps in this book, you might just 
				be ready for the challenge. To get started learning Python, check out the online text 
				<em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python</em> (<em>http://openbookproject.net//thinkCSpy/</em>)
				and check out the section on App Inventor API building in Chapter 
				24 of this book.</p>

			<h3>Variations</h3>

			<p>Once you get the app working, you might want to explore some variations. For 
				example,</p>

			<ul>
				<li>As is, the app hangs if the search doesn’t return any books (for instance, when 
					the user enters an invalid ISBN). Modify the blocks so that the app reports when 
					there are no results.
				<li>Modify the app so that it only displays books under $10.
				<li>Modify the app so that after you scan a book, its lowest Amazon price is spoken 
					out loud (use the <span class="python">TextToSpeech</span> component discussed in the “Android, Where’s 
					My Car?” app in Chapter 7).
				<li>Download the <em>http://aiamazonapi.appspot.comAPI</em> code from
					<em>http://examples.oreilly.com/0636920016632/</em>
					and modify it so that it returns more information. 
					For example, you might have it return the Amazon URL of each book, display 
					the URL along with each listed book, and let the user click the URL to open that 
					page. As mentioned earlier, modifying the API requires Python programming 
					and some knowledge of Google’s App Engine. For more information, check out 
					Chapter 24.</li>

			<h3>Summary</h3>

			<p>Here are some of the concepts we’ve covered with this app:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>You can access the Web from an app using <span class="python">TinyWebDB</span> and specially constructed 
					APIs. You set the <span class="python">ServiceURL</span> of the <span class="python">TinyWebDB</span>
					component to the API URL and 
					then call <span class="pBlock">TinyWebDB.GetValue</span> to request the information. The data isn’t immediately
					returned but can instead be accessed within the <span class="pBlock">TinyWebDB.GotValue</span> event handler.</li>
				<li>The <span class="pBlock">BarcodeScanner.DoScan</span> function launches the scan. When the user scans 
					a barcode, the <span class="pBlock">BarcodeScanner.AfterScan</span> event is triggered and the scanned 
					data is placed in the argument <span class="python">result</span>.</li>
				<li>In App Inventor, complex data is represented with lists and lists of lists. If you 
					know the format of the data returned from an API, you can use <span class="pBlock">foreach</span> and 
					<span class="pBlock">select list item</span> to extract the separate pieces of information into variables, and 
					then perform whatever processing or display you’d like using those variables.</li>
			</ul>
