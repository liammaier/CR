				Three-hundred-year-old ivy-covered systems are colliding 
				with modern networked technology. As I walked the hallways 
				of the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business this 
				morning, I saw students carrying around heavy paper textbooks. 
				That’s changing, and students are now using Web resources 
				beyond their textbooks to study. I peeked into a classroom 
				and saw most students taking notes on laptops and a couple 
				had tablets (mostly iPads). Some professors were writing on 
				whiteboards with dry erase markers. That too is changing as 
				professors are moving toward interactive whiteboards to record 
				their lecture notes. Students have already changed, and now 
				universities are catching up to their population … slowly, very 
				slowly. In other words, your school will most likely NOT be as 
				technologically advanced as you are.

					Use Technology to Your Advantage
				</h3>

				<p>
					I love technology because it speaks to my theories about customizing your education. In college, information will be coming 
					at you in a one-size-fits-all format, and technology can (and 
					should) be used as a customization weapon. The following 
					section describes several ways you can use technology to augment your studies.

					Recorded lectures
				</h3>

				<p>
					Some professors will record their lectures and upload them to a 
					Web-based platform like Apple’s iTunes U for you to download 
					as a podcast. The beauty of listening to a recorded lecture is that 
					you can PAUSE, REWIND, or even FAST-FORWARD. Imagine if 
					you could point a remote control at your professor and “pause” 
					her until you finish writing your notes. This feature gives you 
					that flexibility. The professor is powerful but the student can be 
					agile. In some ways, listening to a podcast can be even better 
					than a live lecture because students may be reluctant to say to 
					a professor, “Can you repeat that?” or “I don’t get it.” Yet with 
					a podcast you don’t have to fear embarrassment; just hit pause 
					or rewind. One professor I know records a few pieces of his 
					lectures even before he presents the lecture in class because 
					those pieces contain material that’s difficult to understand. If 
					a student listens ahead of time he or she is poised for greater 
					comprehension in class. What a great study aid for his students! 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					The disadvantages of recorded lectures are that you can’t 
					ask questions or debate, and recorded lectures don’t work for 
					all class types. Classes that involve discussion and debate are

					not easily delivered on a podcast. But if you want to study the 
					functions of mitochondria and you didn’t quite understand the 
					lecture, a podcast is very effective. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					I also recommend that you have something visual to look at 
					when listening to a recorded lecture. Listening to a lecture with 
					nothing visual to follow along with is difficult. The professor’s 
					notes are great; a video (if your school records and posts lectures) is also effective. Can you imagine trying to understand 
					organic chemistry reactions without seeing any diagrams or 
					notes? Nearly impossible.

					Online study aids
				</h3>

				<p class="indent">
					Who says the lecture you want to listen to has to originate from 
					your school? Most students can’t get into the Massachusetts 
					Institute of Technology, but anyone can listen to a lecture via 
					MIT’s Open Courseware program. Another professor might deliver a lecture in a way you’ll understand better. YouTube is full 
					of videos on academic subjects that could help your studying 
					(key word is “could”). The Kahn Institute is helping high school 
					students learn via at-home lectures and lessons and their library 
					for college level courses is continuing to grow. This is a great 
					example of customizing education to the individual student’s 
					needs. You should definitely be customizing your college education beyond simply choosing your classes.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					As the classroom continues to become globalized, there are 
					an increasing number of excellent online resources. There’s 
					also a great deal of junk on the Internet. If you study from 
					an unreliable source, there’s no guarantee that the lessons are 
					credible. Not only might you be studying erroneous or outdated 
					information, but you’ll be wasting lots of time. Talk to your 
					professors and ask them what sources are reliable and which 
					ones to avoid. If nothing else, seek resources from accredited 
					institutions such as the MIT resource I mentioned.

					notes, past exams, problem sets, and study guides. Koofers and 
					Course Hero are examples. If used responsibly, they can be 
					very helpful. If you like a set of notes on Koofers, that’s great 
					… but check the material for validity by cross referencing facts 
					with proven sources such a text book or university sourced info; 
					doing so will make for a great study session. Cut and paste the 
					material into your notes for maximum effectiveness.

					Digital notes

				<p>
					I previously discussed digital note taking in Chapter 5, but 
					what I didn’t mention is where to store those notes. If you carry 
					around your laptop, storing your notes on your hard drive is 
					fine because the notes will be accessible. Just make sure you’re 
					backing up your notes to a Web-based storage site such as 
					Dropbox, Carbonite, or iCloud (there are many more options 
					many of which are FREE) or an external hard drive. If you use 
					a tablet (such as an iPad) or smartphone, make sure you use 
					a Web-based storage site since you won’t have significant hard 
					drive storage available locally. Accessibility is the key because 
					you never know when a pocket of study time may present itself 
					and of course you won’t want to always carry around your 
					laptop and/or books.

					Online classes
				</h3>

				<p>
					Online classes have dramatically increased in popularity and 
					I believe they will continue to as technology continues to improve. In fact, you can now obtain an entire college degree 
					online. I’ve been asked many times if I find online degrees 
					to be credible. I personally don’t believe an entire degree can 
					be effectively replicated online. There is too much lost by not 
					interacting in person with fellow classmates and instructors. 
					We still live in a world that requires people-skills and learning to work in teams, giving presentations to a live audience, 
					brainstorming, listening to others, and debating is huge part

					of collegiate learning. With that being said, for some people 
					online degrees provide an educational option that otherwise 
					wouldn’t be available to them due to geographic distance or 
					work schedules. Therefore I don’t discredit online degrees; I 
					simply prefer traditional degrees (blended with technology) if 
					it is an option for you. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					While I prefer traditional (in class) degrees, I do believe individual
					online classes can fit nicely into your degree program. 
					Certain classes can be very effectively delivered online and your 
					school will probably offer this option. Online classes are great 
					options to use in moderation. But before choosing to take one 
					I recommend you consider what types of classes are effectively 
					delivered online and subsequently consider the advantages and 
					disadvantages of an online class. Once you’ve conducted this 
					analysis I believe you can now make an informed decision 
					whether or not to enroll in an online class.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Not all class types are effectively delivered online. Classes 
					that require discussion and debate and/or in-person collaborative teamwork
					are not as effectively delivered online. This sort 
					of human interaction which is professor led and classmate fueled is an
					extremely valuable learning method and cannot be 
					fully replicated on a computer. Therefore, if possible, I would 
					not consider taking classes such as political science, ethics, 
					leadership, or history (to name a few) in the online format. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					What classes are good choices for online delivery? Subjects 
					that require minimal or no interpretation and therefore require 
					little live discussion and/or teamwork can be effectively delivered online.
					Examples of such classes include financial accounting and sciences that don’t require a laboratory session such 
					as anatomy or physiology. Computer science and mathematical 
					classes can also be effectively delivered online especially if 
					they include problems and exercises that measure your learning progress and
					therefore alert you to review a concept if you 
					haven’t mastered it yet.

					There are many advantages to online classes. The most obvious advantage is the flexibility of not having a scheduled class 
					time. You can study where you want when you want; an online 
					class will never present a scheduling conflict. A second advantage is that you decide the pace in which you complete the class 
					sessions. Of course you will have due dates and deadlines but 
					the actual class lessons can be paced at your discretion. No 
					more feeling left behind in class; not to mention you can pause 
					or rewind whenever you choose! Haven’t you always wanted 
					to “pause” or “rewind” a teacher in the middle of class? A final 
					advantage is the increase in class options available to you. With 
					online learning you are not limited by your physical location or 
					school; you may be able to complete an online class for credit 
					at another university if that class is not available at your school. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					There are also many disadvantages to online classes. They 
					are impersonal and classroom discussion cannot be replicated. 
					A second disadvantage is that non-verbal communication is 
					mostly one-way, meaning the professor is unable to read the 
					body language of the class. Professors in a classroom can sense 
					whether or not the students are responsive and adjust the lesson 
					accordingly. This agility is lost online. A final disadvantage is 
					the minimal ability to learn from your classmates. Collegiate 
					learning is in large part a live exchange of ideas between your 
					professor, you, and your classmates. With online classes, teamwork and real-time discussion is greatly limited.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Many educators believe that online classes are often favored 
					by less motivated students who are too lazy to go to class. I 
					believe this to be a misconception and that it takes a very 
					motivated student to learn successfully via an online class. If 
					you take an online class you have to be disciplined enough to 
					follow a reasonably paced schedule because you do not attend 
					weekly classes nor is a professor assessing your learning via 
					in-class dialogue. You must self-assess and that takes honesty

					and discipline. Time management skills are perhaps even more 
					important to utilize in online courses. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					In summary, I have no problem with students taking online 
					classes but I recommend they do so in moderation (no more 
					than one or two per semester) and only for the right type of 
					classes (ones that require minimal dialogue and in-person collaboration). Technology will continue to progress and professors 
					will develop more effective methods of teaching online. But 
					for now, I still favor live class sessions for the majority of your 
					education (supplemented with technology).

						Online Classes are Different than Virtual Classes

						Virtual classes take place online however they are

						have a medium for asking questions via voice or instant 
						message. The advantage of virtual classes is you can 
						take them from any location that has internet access.

					Summary
				</h3>

				<p>
					Technology is affecting education in significant ways, both for 
					students and teachers. Students have already embraced technology, and their
					encouragement is helping schools adopt technology as well. While I don’t believe that technology could in any 
					way replace the role of professors (or classmates), I do believe 
					that technology integration can create better classroom experiences. I also
					believe that technology can help students arrive 
					in class better prepared—and that benefits the learning of the 
					entire class. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					The danger of Web-based study tools is that many of them 
					lack credibility; therefore, you have to determine if the material comes
					from reputable sources. Furthermore, there is so 
					much information in so many different formats that a student 
					can drown in a sea of material. Don’t forget that Web-based 
					material is for augmenting your studying and not a primary 
					source; your professor is still your guide. Technology is like a 
					superpower, and like any superpower it has the potential to 
					cause both positive and negative outcomes. Used properly, I 
					believe technology can empower students and teachers while 
					fostering global learning.
