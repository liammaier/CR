				The U.S. Department of Education estimates that only 10 percent of

				Colorado, Denver conducted a study that estimates 88 percent 
				of veterans drop out during their first year and finally the 
				Student Veterans Association of America estimates a 30-40

				veterans how to navigate and succeed in the college academic 
				environment. While the life transition for veterans goes far 
				beyond academics, by lessening the stress of the academic 
				transition, likelihood of success is significantly increased. One 
				goal of this book is to help raise graduation rates amongst our 
				nation’s veterans. A second and larger goal is to help students

				ultimately improve their career opportunities.

				Why do so many students struggle during their first year in 
				college? The main reason is their inability to effectively transition
				from high school or military to college academics—yet this 
				struggle has little to do with one’s level of intelligence; it has 
				everything to do with the lack of education on this transitional 
				period. The bright side is that failure is preventable and success 
				in the form of a high grade point average (GPA) is achievable for 
				almost every student regardless of his or her natural aptitude 
				or academic background.

				<em>The Strategic Student Veteran’s Edition</em> is your roadmap for 
				de-mystifying college academics and creating a strategic mindset for
				academic success. It is an outgrowth of lessons learned

				<li>
					My experience as a freshmen academic advisor and adjunct

				</li>

				<li>
					My return to college at age thirty-two to retake freshmen-level 
					classes while applying the strategies in this book 
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				I spent almost four years interviewing college freshmen about 
				their academic habits before I went back to school to test the 
				strategies I collected. I wanted to retake classes I took over a 
				decade earlier, take some new classes, and put into practice

				<h3>
					How This Book Will Help You
				</h3>

				<p>
					<em>The Strategic Student Veteran’s Edition</em> provides proven, realistic 
					methods to implement in your academic life. Specifically it will: 
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						teach you how to develop a mindset that was not necessary 
						in high school or in the military
					</li>

					<li>
						show you ways to accept control and ownership of your 
						education 
					</li>

					<li>
						help you efficiently manage your time
					</li>

					<li>
						guide you in creating a plan for your academic career (your 
						school will not do this for you!). 
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					In other words, you’ll learn how to incorporate academic structure
					to a very unstructured system. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					This book also advises on what not to do. A major benefit of 
					knowing what not to do is that it helps you recognize inefficient 
					behaviors that will undoubtedly surround you. Being able to 
					identify those behaviors is the first and most important step in 
					avoidance. If you take nothing else from this book but the ability to
					identify and avoid adopting the inefficient patterns you 
					see in others, you’re already way ahead of the game. Therefore, 
					I will discuss poor habits almost as much as good habits. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					<em>The Strategic Student</em> is divided into three parts. Part One describes
					how and why this book came to be, and why developing 
					self-reliance and managing your GPA are critical to your college

					dealing with stress and understanding the role of technology

					Who Will Benefit from This Book?
				</h3>

				<p class="indent">
					<em>The Strategic Student Veteran’s Edition</em> is designed for active duty
					armed forces members or veterans who are either 
					just about to enter college or are early in their college career. 
					Additionally, educators, coaches, and advisors who are concerned
					about their students and want to help them succeed will 
					find the tools in this book invaluable.

					This Book is Different than Other Books
				</h3>

				<p class="indent">
					<em>The Strategic Student</em> is NOT a magic formula resulting in 
					straight A’s. Any book claiming to have a single system that 
					helps all students achieve college success is making a false 
					claim. There are many study strategies in book stores; some 
					will work for you and some will not. Although this book does 
					cover essential study techniques, its main purpose is to help 
					you transition your mindset and manage resources such as time 
					(Chapter 4) and writing (Chapter 8). Finally, this book is not 
					about shortcuts and it’s not for students who aren’t ready and 
					willing to work. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					My main criticism of some of the “Get an A” books out 
					there is that the author spent his or her time only interviewing 
					professors, straight-A students and Ivy Leaguers. They never 
					interviewed the students who struggle to discover what NOT 
					TO DO. What not to do is half the battle! While I have tremendous
					respect for Ivy League students (for example); the fact is 
					they’ve probably always been great students (that’s why they 
					are where they are). Ivy League students don’t know what it’s 
					like to not “get it” and therefore their lessons are incomplete. A

					complete library of lessons includes those learned from students 
					who have experienced academic struggles and subsequently 
					succeeded. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					The best lessons in this book are derived from my D or C 
					students who, through strategic changes, learned to become B 
					or A students. The best lessons are also from below-average 
					high school students who went on to become great college 
					students. These students truly know about strategizing and 
					maximizing potential. I was shocked to find other authors have 
					ignored this population in their research. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					As a college freshman advisor, I was unable to find a book 
					that supplied what my struggling students needed in order to 
					adapt to the challenges of college academics. Moreover, these 
					students needed to hear about other struggling students who 
					are now successful. This book is a result of collecting their 
					input, developing various learning strategies, and testing these 
					theories firsthand when I returned to college as a freshman in 
					the fall of 2009. I routinely get asked why I returned to school 
					to take undergraduate classes and my answer is simple, “to test 
					academic strategies and deliver only the most effective ones.” 
					Any author who hasn’t actually tested the strategies that he or 
					she writes about is delivering hearsay. Would a car manufacturer sell a car without first test driving it?
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Forget your high school experiences in academics and throw 
					away your SAT/ACT scores; none of it is a predictor of your 
					future collegiate success. Your military experience will help 
					you succeed but only if properly harnessed. Regardless of your 
					military rank, you had a schedule and orders to follow; now 
					you are the one who will create your own schedule and issue 
					your own orders. As you read this book, think about shifting 
					your mindset to one of a strategic student. Once you’ve shifted 
					your mindset to a strategic one, you will truly be amazed at 
					your capacity to learn and ultimately get great grades. I was 
					amazed at my ability to apply these strategies, and I know with

					<h3>
						The Academic Cockpit
					</h3>

					<p>
						My students will tell you I’m a sucker for metaphors. As 
						a former Navy pilot, I tell my students that they need to 
						climb into their academic cockpit in order to take control 
						of their academics.
					</p>

					<p class="indent">
						When a pilot climbs into an aircraft, he or she takes 
						complete control of that machine. The aircraft will do 
						exactly what you tell it to do or let it do. If you let it fly 
						it into a mountain, it will do it without asking any questions.
						If the pilot doesn’t fly the plane, the plane will fly 
						the pilot; the latter scenario never ends well. A student 
						needs to think of a semester the same way. Fly your 
						GPA or it will fly you . . . straight down. 
					</p>

					<p class="indent">
						Anyone who has seen the gauges in a cockpit may 
						think it looks quite complicated. Actually, those gauges 
						just represent feedback—feedback from the airplane 
						telling the pilot one of two things, <em>direction or performance</em>.
						Students need to consider these two themes 
						every day if they want to stay competitive. Am I on 
						course? How am I performing? 
					</p>

					<p class="indent">
						Here is one of the crucial mistakes most college students make:
						<strong>they use their grades as the sole measurement of direction and performance.</strong>
						Grades are 
						the results of past performance (what you did before 
						test day) and therefore not an effective data point for 
						planning. Ask a student how she’s doing in a class and 
						she’ll likely reference a recent test or paper score.
					</p>

					<p class="indent">
						I understand the confusion over why grades are a 
						poor indicator of performance when planning academic

						strategy which is why I want to stick with the cockpit 
						metaphor. What if there was a caution light in a cockpit 
						to alert the pilot that “YOU JUST CRASHED”— a big 
						blinking red light telling you that you just flew into the 
						ground? It’s a little late for that info isn’t it? When a
						student finds out at midterms that he is not performing well, 
						it is also a bit late. Now he is fighting for a B or C instead 
						of an A. And the fight just got a lot harder because the 
						stuff that he just did not learn so well is going to be on 
						the final. Not quite as dire as an aircraft crash but the 
						point is the damage has already been done.
					</p>

					<p class="indent">
						An A is a grade with very little room for damage, 
						therefore a student should approach a semester with a 
						damage-control mindset. A cockpit tells a pilot if there 
						is a problem developing before she crashes. A student 
						needs to monitor his or her performance before being 
						graded. Once a student makes the revelation that grades 
						are an end point and the real performance is what they 
						do between tests; they become a different student. They 
						simply need a system to self-monitor direction and performance.
						<em>The Strategic Student</em> will teach students how 
						to self-monitor. Good luck on your transition to becoming a
						strategic student. I am confident this book will help 
						you to reach your academic goals.
