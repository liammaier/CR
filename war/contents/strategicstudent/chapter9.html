				<span class="firstLetter">C</span>ollege life is very demanding and transitioning from the 
				military can magnify the stress that is already inherent to 
				academics. The good news that I tell all college bound veterans 
				is, what you have done in the military is much more difficult 
				than what you are about to do. This seems to relax them a bit. 
				One of the biggest adjustments that causes stress to veterans 
				is the perception that college is a very selfish environment. 
				Veterans have come from a very selfless environment. You do 
				very little solo in the military; it is the ultimate team pursuit. 
				Adjusting to this solo mission, a hectic schedule, and managing 
				a heavy workload are some of the pressures that can take a 
				toll on students, leading to stress. The approaches discussed in 
				this book—applying a strategic mindset, managing your time 
				efficiently, and developing your academic skills—are ultimately 
				designed to help reduce stress and thus maximize your wellbeing
				and performance throughout your college career.

					actually good. It can be a motivating and focusing force. Too 
					much stress though can impair our health, learning abilities, 
					and performance. Anyone who has undergone any type of 
					weapons training already understands the stress cycle. When 
					a military member is preparing to fire a weapon with live 
					ordnance he or she is taught to stay relaxed. Relaxation allows 
					the shooter to remain flexible and adjust to any changes in the 
					environment. It seems contradictory to teach relaxation while 
					harnessing a combat skill but it is done for a reason. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					When an infantry Marine, for example, has to conduct an 
					amphibious assault, he needs to be relaxed enough to retain 
					accuracy and yet aggressive enough to storm a beachhead. It 
					is understandable that he can become overly stressed, causing greater tension, and now his shooting accuracy is further 
					degraded. He’s caught in a stress cycle and has to break it 
					to accomplish the mission. This exact same cycle occurs in 
					academics. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					When I see a student “stressing out,” I instantly assume she’s 
					not going to do well—just like in weapons training she who 
					won’t hit her target until she relaxes. It’s a vicious cycle because 
					the student’s stress causes her to perform poorly in school and 
					then performing poorly causes her more stress and she ends up 
					doing even worse. Time management is the cycle breaker. I find 
					it ironic that the seemingly not-so-laid-back habit of tracking 
					time makes you a more relaxed student and person, but it does.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					In addition to helping you relax more, managing stress will 
					get you higher grades. When you’re under stress, your body 
					releases hormones. These hormones are involved in various 
					bodily functions including neurotransmission. When stress hormones interfere with neurotransmission, intellectual functions 
					such as memory, concentration, and other cognitive activities 
					are impaired. Did you ever get a test back and notice something 
					you “totally knew the answer to” and wonder why you got it 
					wrong? That very well may have been the result of stress.

					College is stressful, and no combination of habits will completely
					eliminate it. Moreover, there will always be stressful 
					situations you have no control over, like an accident or illness 
					of a loved one. You can, however, keep stress in check by practicing
					healthy lifestyle habits. Remember, some stress is good 
					and can be your friend. This is the stress that will drive you to 
					get out of bed early in the morning to finish your biology lab 
					assignment (most of us probably don’t want to get out of bed 
					to do a biology lab assignment). Just being aware of stress and 
					how it works will motivate you to deploy the stress-fighting 
					skills discussed in this book.

				<h3>
					Get Enough Exercise, Sleep, and Good Nutrition 
				</h3>

				<p>
					Trying to educate college students about nutrition is like trying 
					to teach a fish to ride a bike. They just don’t seem to go together. 
					But, veterans seem to be much more receptive. My goal is not 
					to teach you about nutrition or exercise—I’m not an expert, and 
					there are plenty of awesome books on these subjects. But, I 
					would like to share a few observations regarding the relationship
					between physical/mental health and academics. Physical 
					health and mental health are deeply connected and therefore 
					your physical habits will greatly affect your academics.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					When I was teaching NROTC at the University of Colorado, 
					I routinely went to the recreation center to exercise. I always 
					enjoyed seeing my students there because it gave me a chance 
					to get to know them better outside of the classroom and office. 
					As you know by now, I love spotting trends and I began to 
					notice a trend at the rec center: the students I would see at the 
					gym were mostly my top GPA scorers. I wondered why that 
					was, so I began to incorporate a question about exercise and 
					nutrition into my student interviews. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					My interviews told me that about 75 percent of my A students 
					exercised routinely and “tried” to eat healthy. Believe me, I don’t 
					think college students will ever be on the front cover of any 
				</p>

					health or nutrition magazine, but those who exercised regularly 
					and slept reasonably well usually performed better academically. 
					I am not implying that this is a causal relationship. In other 
					words, I don’t believe that good grades are the result of exercise, 
					but what I can say confidently is that healthy physical habits 
					are powerful weapons for defeating stress. Therefore, if stress is 
					the enemy of academic success and exercise suppresses stress, 
					then logic dictates that healthy physical habits do in fact make 
					you a better student.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					I’d also like to share another observation: most of my struggling students
					did not exercise routinely. The most cited reason: 
					“I just don’t have time.” Really? I find it extremely interesting 
					that my A students had time to exercise yet my struggling students did not.
					Hopefully by now you’re seeing that the habits 
					of successful individuals are usually not isolated to one area of 
					their life. My academically successful students were also very 
					“together” in their personal lives. For example, my A students 
					rarely had issues with personal finance. My struggling students 
					often did. My A students took care of their mind and body; 
					even their social lives were better. My conclusion is that the 
					habits and mindset utilized to defeat stress in your academic 
					life are the very same habits that will help you succeed in the 
					rest of your life. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					My advice is to schedule your workouts and set your nutritional and sleep
					goals and make note of how you feel. You 
					may even consider keeping an exercise journal as you are now 
					aware of the powers of tracking. If you miss a workout, it’s no 
					big deal—just get back on schedule. If you have a bad night’s 
					sleep, try to get a good one the next night. However, if you find 
					yourself canceling workouts because you consistently “don’t 
					have time,” I recommend you use that as a warning; I bet other 
					areas of your life are suffering as well. It might help to brush 
					up on your time-management skills to help break this cycle.

				<h3>
					Spirituality as a Source of Stress Relief
				</h3>

				<p>
					Spirituality is another positive source of mental and physical 
					health for many students. Spirituality is personally defined. For 
					some it may mean going to a weekly religious service while for 
					others it may mean a Saturday afternoon yoga class. I had one 
					student who rode the same mountain bike trail every Sunday 
					and told me that he found peace in the weekly ride. The source 
					of spirituality does not matter too much. What does matter 
					is that my students, who felt a spiritual calling, reported that 
					they found peace, balance, and stress relief by embracing their 
					spirituality and that helped them focus better on academics.

				<h3>
					Find a Mentor
				</h3>

				<p>
					Mentors are people you look up to and would like to emulate. 
					They’re also people who are often closer in age and circumstance to you than your parents, coaches, or advisors. In college 
					a student mentor is someone who is simply further along in 
					school than you. He or she will also probably have something 
					in common with you such as your course of study, sports team, 
					or club affiliation. The reason mentors are so valuable in college 
					is because they’ve done exactly what you’re trying to do. They 
					can provide real-time guidance on issues that advisors might 
					fall short on. Questions like, “How is that professor?” or “Do 
					you recommend that course?” are best suited to fellow students, 
					not advisors or professors.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					A relationship with a mentor doesn’t have to be formal, although some departments such as athletics will have a formal 
					program. If there is a program, I recommend you use it but if 
					not, don’t worry—you can benefit from a mentor without any 
					formalities.

					I had a mentor in college named Sean, and we’re still friends 
					today. Sean was two years ahead of me in school and like me 
					was also in Navy ROTC heading toward an aviation career. 
					Sean was a great student, a respected leader, and an overall 
					fun guy. In other words, he was what I was trying to become 
					in the short term. Sean gave me lots of advice on navigating 
					college, the Navy, and careers in general. He even went on 
					to teach and advise at Cornell University and recommended a 
					similar role for me, which is how I ended up at the University 
					of Colorado, Boulder. I never once told Sean that he was my 
					mentor; I didn’t have to (though I suspect he knew it). My point 
					is that it’s really important to seek guidance from someone 
					who is still in school. A mentor can be helpful in terms of life 
					navigation. It’s also a relief to hear those mentors say, “I was 
					just there and you’ll do fine.”

					Don’t be a Study Hermit
				</h3>

				<p>
					It’s okay to party in college. I’m not actually offering any advice on partying. What I am advocating is blowing off steam. 
					Partying, socializing, whatever you want to call it is a way of 
					doing that, and in my opinion it’s part of the college experience. If it relieves stress, then I am for it. Partying does NOT 
					get students into trouble in college; excessive partying does. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					I’ve included this section to highlight that nowhere in my 
					strategic advice do I advocate becoming a hermit. The time 
					management and study strategies are all designed to maximize 
					learning in minimal time. You don’t have to miss a single party, 
					football game, or any other social event in college if you’re a 
					good time manager. In fact, I want you to socialize because it 
					creates a more balanced mindset than if you were locked away 
					in a study room feeling like you were missing something fun.

					If you do your work in intervals and track your progress, you 
					don’t need to miss out on anything in college. If your work is

					Join a “Team”

				<p>
					Maintaining one’s perspective helps curb stress. Students who 
					have only academics in their life tend to stress more about every 
					quiz and every little point on that quiz. Eventually, they start to 
					lose perspective and perhaps even develop tunnel vision. One 
					way I’ve seen students balance their perspective is to become 
					part of something bigger than they are, perhaps by joining a 
					team or club or by doing volunteer work. Like the military, life 
					is a team sport, and most often greatness is a team victory. I 
					would define a team as any organization that has a mission dependent on more than just one member. Sports, a club, a band, 
					a volunteer organization, or even a part-time job fit the bill. 
					While veteran’s organizations offer great support, I also recommend joining a team of non-veterans. Get to know and 
					understand your new classmates and their life perspectives. We 
					all should learn from each other in college and spending time 
					with non-military classmates will help ease your own transition. 
					Furthermore, you will be serving as a positive ambassador for 
					all of us veterans. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					There are few areas in life that we go at alone. Unfortunately, 
					your college GPA is one of them. The college environment can 
					be insulating and self-centered. But becoming part of a group 
					effort in college has a way of reminding students that working 
					toward a goal with others has purpose, it’s part of the bigger 
					life picture, and it provides perspective on our own lives and 
					challenges. It can relieve stress. So consider picking something 
					of interest and participating. Just remember to schedule your 
					hours! (Sorry, I couldn’t resist.)

					Summary
				</h3>

				<p>
					This chapter is designed simply to make you aware of the role 
					stress plays in your academic life. Stress is truly the enemy 
					of a high GPA. You cannot alleviate all stress, but you can 
					manage negative stress while embracing positive stress. All 
					of your habits will contribute to stress as either a positive or 
					negative force. Procrastinating increases stress. Managing your 
					time decreases stress. Skipping class increases stress. Studying 
					efficiently decreases stress. You get the point. Every decision 
					you make in college can increase or decrease stress. Keep that 
					in mind and you’ll make more right decisions than wrong ones, 
					which will make you a better student. Transitioning out of the 
					military is very difficult, the methods discussed in this book 
					are designed to decrease academic stress and thus minimize 
					your total stress.
