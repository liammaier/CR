				was extremely structured and your classmates were on the same

					College Academics versus High School Academics
				</h3>

				<p>
					A general assumption of incoming college freshmen (and their 
					parents) is that college academics are more difficult than high 
					school academics. I don’t believe college academics are more 
					difficult, at least at the freshmen level. Yet freshman year is 
					pivotal because this is when you either “figure it out” or become 
					convinced it’s “too hard.” I personally didn’t figure it out my

					let’s not tug at that string), and that’s a main reason why, as a 
					freshman advisor, I wanted to help students make their college 
					transition a more successful one than mine. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					As I mentioned in Chapter 1, my first class of advisees (all 
					freshmen) was polarized between success and failure and I 
					wasn’t sure why. There simply weren’t many middle of the 
					packers and I incorrectly assumed that the more intelligent 
					students succeeded and the lesser failed. When the parents of 
					struggling students started calling me, they all shared something
					like this: “But [fill in son or daughter’s name] did fine in 
					high school. I guess college is just much more difficult.” They 
					too were incorrect. Freshmen college academics are often a 
					review of senior-level high school courses, with a deeper dive 
					as time moves on in the semester. Figure 2.1 illustrates how 
					high school and college really differ.

				<h3>
					Different educational system, different learning environment
				</h3>

				<p>
					In high school, classes meet almost every weekday, so even if 
					you aren’t studying much at home, there’s still a learning opportunity
					in class daily. And because you turn in so much homework and meet daily,
					teachers will know quickly if you’re falling 
					behind and they’ll usually take action to help you. College 
					classes meet at most three times a week. Many meet only twice 
					a week. If you fall behind, no one will know until grades occur: 
					except for you.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					In high school, there is oversight and guidance almost every 
					step of the way. Bell rings, you go to class. Bell rings again, you 
					leave class. You don’t even need to think about it. A teacher, 
					coach, or parent is almost always kicking your butt. These positive
					forces don’t really exist in college. Parents are at home. The 
					class at 10 a.m. didn’t take attendance. The professor lectures 
					on the subject for those interested in listening, and there’s 
					little homework to hand in. <em>The difference is not the academic 
					material. The difference is the dramatically different learning 
					environment.</em>
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					The other major shift that catches students off guard is where 
					the learning takes place. In high school most of the learning 
					takes place in school. In college most of the learning takes place 
					outside the classroom (see Figure 2.2). I think most students 
					expect this shift but grossly underestimate the degree of the 
					split. I’ll elaborate on this concept in Chapter 4, but for now 
					I just want you to grasp how much you are on your own in 
					college. If you start to understand this you won’t be defeated 
					(which happens often) when you arrive on campus. You’ll also 
					have a plan, which is exactly what this book is about.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					The student who adjusts to this dramatically different environment
					succeeds. The one who doesn’t … well, you know. 
					Understanding this environment change is the basis for your 
					strategic mindset. Oh, and one other thing: if you are not in

					<p>
						In his bestselling book <em>Blink</em> (2005), Malcolm Gladwell 
						discusses how humans interpret information and make 
						fast decisions based on little real-time information—that 
						is, in a “blink” of an eye. It’s intriguing how often these 
						snap decisions are correct, even when compared to 
						decisions incorporating great information and deep 
						analysis. As with a seasoned firefighter, who senses 
						when a building will collapse seconds before it does, 
						when humans become experienced at something, we 
						become proficient at rapidly predicting the outcome. 
					</p>

					<p class="indent">
						As a pilot, I was once told you can’t start trusting the 
						hairs on the back of your neck until after you’ve had at least 
						five hundred hours of flight time. After that many hours of 
						flying, I began to sense how the aircraft was performing 
						and even to sense if something was about to go wrong. 
					</p>

					<p class="indent">
						One day, with only about one hundred hours of 
						flight time under my belt, I had just taken off from Naval Air
						Station Coronado; it was a beautiful San Diego 
						day, and I was enjoying the view of Point Loma. Suddenly, my
						veteran aircraft commander, Reggie Hammond, grabbed the controls from me, turned the aircraft 
						around, and started heading back toward our base. On 
						the way back, a caution light illuminated, indicating engine
						trouble. In other words, Reggie knew we had an 
						emergency before the aircraft even knew. How did he 
						know? “I just knew,” he said. “Things didn’t feel right.” 
					</p>

					<p class="indent">
						By that point, Reggie had flown about two thousand 
						hours, which helped him make that fast, gut-level decision.
						Similarly, after a few years of advising freshmen, 
						I had developed the ability to predict the needs of my 
						students based on experience.

					What is a self-reliant student?
				</h3>

				<p>
					A self-reliant student is a student who <em>initiates</em> action without 
					being prompted by an external source. The external source 
					could be a professor, a parent, an advisor, maybe a friend. The 
					word “initiate” is key here. Sometimes my students confuse 
					my goal of self-reliance to mean that I don’t want them to 
					need external help or guidance. This is 100 percent NOT what 
					I mean. Every college student will need assistance at some 
					point—that’s a normal part of higher education. In college you 
					can get help if you seek out the proper resource, but you have 
					to initiate the effort.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					When I was an advisor I’d send an email to my students for 
					them to make a mid-semester appointment with me to discuss 
					grades. Who do you think were the first ones to respond? 
					You guessed it. Usually my star students were the ones who 
					responded first. The students who needed the appointment least 
					were the first to respond. Coincidence? I doubt it.

					Every August the Naval Science department at the University of 
					Colorado, Boulder, would host a welcome-to-school orientation 
					for incoming freshmen and their parents. It was always fun. 
					We’d eat burgers, play softball, and provide an opportunity for 
					families to meet our staff. At this event, I was introduced as the 
					freshmen advisor for the naval science students 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Because dropping a son or daughter off at school, especially 
					if it’s far from home, is stressful for parents and students, most 
					students and their families wanted to meet me. The welcome 
					party served to facilitate that, and I was happy to meet my new 
					crop of students. It was during this introduction that a student’s 
					likelihood to struggle during their first school year, and their 
					potential need for extra attention, first surfaced. The introduction

					2. The <em>parents would introduce</em> themselves and the student to me.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p class="indent">
					After a few years and several welcome orientations later, I 
					concluded that the student who walked up to me and introduced 
					me to her parents was usually proactive. I call her a <em>driver</em>. A 
					driver takes control. The student whose parents conducted the 
					introduction was often more dependent on others. I call him a 
					passenger. A passenger is along for the ride and doesn’t offer 
					much input. Although I couldn’t predict the student’s academic 
					aptitude or ability from this first impression, I do believe it was 
					telling in terms of which students would be more self-reliant 
					and which ones wouldn’t be.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					The parents who conducted the introduction often proceeded 
					to tell me about their child. I’d sit there and listen while the 
					freshman heard himself being discussed as if he wasn’t present. 
					The same parents were often the ones who called me throughout the year to check on their son or daughter. They would 
					often ask me questions they hadn’t even asked their student 
					yet such as, “How is [name] doing?” or “What can she improve 
					on?”. I can say this very confidently: the students whose parents 
					called me regularly were almost never academically successful. I discussed this observation with many students and the 
					conclusion I found was: a student’s academic success has little 
					to do with how intelligent they are. It has to do with whether 
					or not they’re self-reliant.

						If you’re an incoming college freshman and you were meeting your

				<p class="indent">
					Let’s look at self-reliance in terms of academics. Most schools 
					suggest that a student study two to three hours for every inclass hour. It’s a broad rule of thumb. (In Chapter 4, I’ll discuss 
					the flaws of this rule, but for the sake of discussion I’ll stick 
					with this suggestion to prove a broader point.) Most college 
					classes meet for three hours a week. That means the school 
					recommends you study that subject for six to nine hours a week. 
					Apply this rule to your entire schedule of classes, and 50 to 75 
					percent of your academic pursuit will take place outside of the 
					classroom. Theoretically, this means that <em>50 to 75 percent of 
					your college education is self-guided.</em>
				</p>

				<p class="indent">					
					This point is usually a bit shocking at first, especially to 
					parents. The reason I teach this theme is not to criticize universities. They’re doing exactly what they should be doing, and 
					they’re doing an excellent job. I teach this to prepare students 
					that self-reliance isn’t just a nice quality to have—it’s absolutely 
					necessary for success. Another reason I teach this is to clarify 
					the role of the student and the role of the university. Once 
					those roles are understood, self-reliance just seems to make 
					more sense to students.

					A university’s job, in the broadest sense, is research and education.
					Your college will present you with subject matter—math,

					your college will NOT teach you time management. Outside 
					of class, you’re on your own. There will be academic centers

				<h3>
					The self-reliant student’s role within the university 
				</h3>

				<p>
					It’s important to realize that the university’s job is to teach 
					subject matter. In class you will learn some essential points 
					and your professor will present important lessons, but it takes 
					significantly more time outside of class to truly learn the material.
					So if you understand this point, you’re probably one step 
					ahead in realizing that if you’re only in class 30 percent of 
					the time, then your university is really only responsible for 30 
					percent of your education time. You are in charge of the other 
					70 percent! Imagine if your college websites stated, “We only 
					contribute to 30 percent of your education, the rest is up to 
					you!” This is dramatically different from high school because in 
					high school, bright students can learn most of what they need 
					to know in class. External time is minimal. Parents are often 
					very upset with the college if their son or daughter fails out (I 
					know—I’ve received that phone call!), but if you understand 
					the role of the student and the school, this misunderstanding 
					won’t occur and you can prepare accordingly. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Colleges generally operate in departmental segments. The 
					school of business will largely have no interaction with the 
					school of engineering. Your English professor will probably 
					have no idea what resources are available to help you in your 
					calculus class. Because freshmen often take a wide spectrum 
					of classes to fulfill core requirements, they can be all over

					campus. Self-reliant students grasp early on that they actually 
					are students at multiple “schools.” The larger the campus, the 
					less centralized the resources there will be. Each school and 
					department will have separate centers for study rooms, tutors, 
					and so on, so you’ll need to seek out the resources within the 
					school/department that houses the class you’re taking. It will 
					take a little time and digging to find out what exactly is available,
					and your professor is a great starting point. Departmental 
					websites also offer lots of information. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					I’ve heard students say on many occasions, “I didn’t even 
					know that resource center was there.” Remember, no one is 
					going to invite you—you must go on your own. Similarly, a 
					self-reliant student starts a study-group and doesn’t wait for an 
					invitation to join one. Self-reliance initiates the action, but help 
					is there waiting. Tutors, advisors, study groups, and clubs are 
					all around, but you must contact them yourself.

				<h3>
					What to Expect from Your College Advisor 
				</h3>

				<p>
					Do you know how many required meetings the average college student
					has with their academic advisor over four years? 
					Two. That’s it—one freshman year and one prior to graduation 
					(some schools also require an additional meeting if you change 
					majors). 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Advisors are truly there to help, but there’s only so much they 
					can do for each student. The very nature of their job imposes 
					limitations that are beyond their control. Once you understand 
					these limitations, you’ll learn to better utilize your advisor’s 
					services and help him or her to do their job better, which is to 
					help you succeed! Here are a few of the obstacles an advisor 
					faces:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Number of students the advisor manages.</strong> At a large university
						an academic advisor often has up to five hundred students! This means that during any given semester you’ll likely

				<ul>
					<li class="hiddenBullet">
						have only one meeting (at most) and that meeting will be 
						brief. Any other meetings will require an appointment, which 
						may take a few days (or weeks) to schedule. Even at a smaller 
						school the advisor is greatly limited. 
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Time lag before the advisor sees your grades.</strong> If you don’t 
						access your advisor, the advisor won’t know you’re having 
						any difficulties until after he or she receives your semester 
						grades. Advisors generally don’t see midterm grades and even 
						if they did, it’s still too late for them to do much. Using grades 
						as a performance reference is bit like waiting until you’re sunburned to apply sunscreen. The damage is done and there’s 
						not much you can do except plan your next beach day better. 
						My point is: Advisors would rather prevent a problem than 
						try and fix one. Your advisor can’t help you repair a broken 
						semester when the semester is already over. 
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Advisors often “ignore” good students.</strong> You know the old 
						saying “The squeaky wheel gets the grease.” In academia this 
						statement is too often true. If you’re a solid B student (3.0 
						GPA), you’re a very good student. But even though you’re 
						a good student, you’re striving to be a great student, an A 
						student. You’re trying to get into that top law school! You too 
						need assistance getting to the next level and you have limited 
						time to do it. The problem is your advisor likely will be quite 
						busy with her problematic students. 
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="indent">
					So you see, the obstacles are significant, and there’s not much 
					advisors can do to eliminate them. By writing this book, my 
					hope is that it will help you take a more proactive and independent role in your own academic planning. After all, it’s your 
					GPA, not your advisor’s. You leave school with that GPA, so you 
					have to take ownership of it early on.

				<h3>
					Maximizing your relationship with your advisor
				</h3>

				<p>
					An academic advisor’s job at most schools is to provide program 
					guidance. For the most part, your advisor is there for what I 
					call “big picture” items. Such items include: 
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						degree plans (determining the most effective plan to excel 
						and graduate on time)
					</li>

					<li>
						program requirements (class and major prerequisites)
					</li>

					<li>
						scholarship information
					</li>

					<li>
						department and campus resources
					</li>

					<li>
						personal crisis (you should alert your advisor if you have a 
						family emergency) 
					</li>

					<li>
						program changes
					</li>

					<li>
						transferability of coursework from different schools
					</li>

					<li>
						graduate program advice
					</li>

					<li>
						registration info
					</li>

					<li>
						career options 
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="indent">
					To maximize value during your very limited advisor time, 
					you’ll need a strategy. For instance, if you have a thirty-minute 
					appointment with your advisor, you do NOT want to spend 
					fifteen minutes discussing something you could have found out 
					on the department’s website. Here are three important things 
					you can do to maximize value in those appointments.
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						If your advisor schedules the meeting, have specific questions 
						prepared. Send an email a few days prior asking if there are 
						any items or information he or she would like you to bring. 
					</li>

					<li>
						If you schedule the meeting, clarify your reason. Let the advisor know your specific purpose for the meeting. This will

					I have tremendous respect for academic advisors. Almost 
					every academic advisor I’ve ever met has been a dedicated 
					educator. The academic advisor plays a crucial role in helping 
					you navigate your education. If you can manage the day-to-day 
					aspects of your academics, such as time management, course 
					research, and study skills, your advisor will be best utilized for 
					the big picture strategy items.

				<h3>
					Summary
				</h3>

				<p>
					My passion for education is matched by my goal for creating 
					more self-reliant students. No matter how good an advisor I am, 
					I know that the less a student needs me, the better off he or 
					she is. I also understand that no matter how much time your 
					advisor is willing to spend with you, you will still manage the 
					vast majority of your college time on your own. A self-reliant 
					student accepts that he or she is now in the driver’s seat. In high 
					school the ownership of your success is shared between you, 
					your parents, and teachers. In the military, you had officers and 
					senior enlisted leaders guiding your daily routine. Your success 
					was most often team based. In college, you own your success. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Many of your professors will be exceptional educators, but 
					their commitment will be to the class as a unit and not to the 
					individual student. I realized early on in my advising career 
					that the greatest thing any teacher can do to help a student is 
					to teach them how to help themselves. No two students are 
					alike and no two student schedules are alike. You are the one 
					and only person on campus dedicated to your curriculum and 
					your curriculum only. There is no one else with that as a sole 
					responsibility. Advisors, professors, and staff are spread thin 
					over many students. Strategic planning and self-reliance are 
					your keys to success. Make a plan. Follow it. Then adjust it 
					when circumstances change … because they will.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Did your operations in the military ever go exactly as 
					planned? Probably not. But military precision is still achieved

					because while the plan gave you the right general direction, you 
					subsequently adjusted your tactics based on real-time information. Your academics will follow a similar cycle. Strategy is your 
					big picture and tactics are your day to day skills.
