					Boost Learning in Class, Reduce Study Time Later

					In Chapter 4, I outlined a four-step time-management process: 
					Estimate—Execute—Track—Repeat. Recall that the reason for 
					the “repeat” step is to let you fine-tune your original estimation. 
					This means you either adjust or not adjust your estimation as 
					your experience in a particular class grows. In other words, 
					you may decrease, increase, or not change your weekly study 
					hours. Ideally, you’re either remaining constant or decreasing 
					your original estimation.

					To ensure you won’t need to increase your study hours, you’ll 
					want to make the most of your limited classroom time, which 
					is only about 12 to 15 hours a week. The following basic strategies will help you squeeze the greatest value out of those short 
					sessions with your professor, thereby enhancing your in-class 
					learning.
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Show up. I don’t mean just physically.</strong> When I returned to 
						college as a freshman, I spent time in the classroom studying 
						student behavior. I saw behavior that you would never see in 
						a military classroom. I saw many students texting, Web surfing, and one time I even saw a student watching a television 
						show on Hulu.com. And don’t get me started on Facebook. 
						You’re only going to be in class for about an hour—you won’t 
						miss anything in that hour, I promise. Showing up simply 
						means shutting down your other media and being present in 
						that class. If you’re not there mentally, there’s little reason to 
						be there physically.
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Learn what you need to learn.</strong> The job of high school
						teachers is to teach. In college your professors’ job is partially to 
						teach but mostly to help support your learning. You can’t possibly
						learn all that you need to learn in class alone. I remind 
						you of this because as an advisor I saw many students who 
						felt defeated or left behind when classes started. Some complained
						that their professors went too fast and they couldn’t 
						mentally keep up. Others got the uncomfortable sense they 
						were slowing their class down when the professor remarked, 
						“We have to move on.” Don’t worry about this—classes are 
						designed to move fast and often faster than our minds. Leave 
						each class having learned some material but also with notes 
						on what you need to study. Studying and time management 
						are your equalizers.
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Don’t sit in the back.</strong> In every class I taught, the back row

						was always the first to fill up. I assumed it was me but the 
						same thing happened in every class I was a student in as well. 
						In the classes I taught, the students who sat closer to the front 
						scored higher grades. I don’t believe where you sit determines your grades, though I’m convinced that students who 
						sit up front are more engaged physically and mentally. This 
						is especially true in large lecture halls. It can be very easy for 
						your mind to wander when you’re far from the spotlight. 
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Schedule your classes strategically.</strong> Give some thought 
						before scheduling your class time. I had a student who scheduled 8 a.m. classes and slept through half of them. If you’re a 
						morning person, schedule your classes accordingly. If you’re 
						not a morning person, don’t schedule morning classes. Play to 
						your strengths.

			<h3>
				There Most Certainly Are Dumb Questions
			</h3>

			<p>
				I began teaching naval science classes at University of Colorado 
				on the basis of my Navy education and career as an officer 
				rather than being a trained academic, hence the title assistant 
				(or adjunct) professor. My position was to be for three to four 
				years, and I had to learn fast how to be an effective educator 
				and advisor. I’m telling you this because I was not a traditional 
				educator and I viewed academics with a perspective different 
				than those who have spent their whole careers on campus. 
				I’ve worked with various professors at University of Colorado 
				and have had many discussions about education and student 
				mentality. My aim here, and throughout this book, is to provide 
				some insight into how professors think and in so doing help 
				create self-reliant students who strategically navigate their own 
				academics. 
			</p>

			<p class="indent">				
				We’ve all heard it said, “There are no dumb questions.” I’ve 
				actually heard professors say it out loud to their classes. Yet 
				some professors have discussed with me the “dumb question(s)”
			</p>

<!-- Page 98 -->

					they heard in their classes. I admit—I’ve heard plenty of dumb 
					questions in my classes, too. I can also tell you that professors 
					will form negative opinions about you based on those dumb 
					questions, which can adversely affect your grades. What exactly 
					constitutes a dumb question? <em>A dumb question is a question that 
					reveals you did nothing to prepare for the class.</em> It shows that 
					you chose not to do the assignment. Let me give an example. 
					One day in my Navy history class I was lecturing on the Battle 
					of Tripoli. To prepare the students for the lecture, I assigned 
					them a short chapter about the Barbary Wars, which discussed 
					when the Battle of Tripoli occurred. Here are two dumb questions I received and why I thought they were dumb: 
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						“What war was the Battle of Tripoli in?” While I don’t expect 
						students to understand everything they read prior to class 
						(that’s why we have class), the student who asked this question would have known what war Tripoli was in if he simply 
						read the first paragraph of the chapter and nothing else. He 
						just conveyed to me he hadn’t even glanced at the assigned 
						reading.
					</li>

					<li>
						“Where is the Barbary Coast?” If the student who asked this 
						question had merely flipped to the chapter opening, she 
						would have seen a map on the second page. She just conveyed to me she didn’t even open her book.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p class="indent">
					The vast majority of questions are NOT dumb. Any question 
					that conveys “I read the chapter but didn’t understand [fill in the 
					blank]” is fine. In fact, it’s better than fine—by asking engaging 
					questions you’re helping the professor teach the material. Here’s 
					an example of such a question: “Why were pirates conducting 
					attacks on American ships off the Barbary Coast?” This question 
					shows you read the chapter but didn’t understand something. 
					It will now kick off a great discussion. Teachers love questions 
					and they hate lecturing to silent classes. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					In summary, there are dumb questions and professors do

					make note of them. A dumb question conveys you didn’t do the 
					assignment and you didn’t even try. If you get behind and miss 
					an assignment from time to time, here’s what I would do: sit 
					quietly and take notes. Do not raise your hand and even suggest 
					that you didn’t care about your assignment and now want the 
					professor to bring you up to speed at the class’s expense. 
				</p>

				<div class="indentedSection top bottom">
					<h3>
						Recommended versus Required Reading
					</h3>

					<p>
						There’s a difference between recommended reading and 
						required reading. If your professor doesn’t explicitly delineate which is which, ask or check with a previous 
						student of the class. Students rarely have time to read 
						everything prior to class—and that’s okay. Don’t let that 
						crush your spirit. Read it all if you can, but at the very 
						least read the required portion and you’ll be adequately 
						prepared. 
					</p>
				</div>

				<p class="indent">
					Any question that shows you read the assignment but would 
					like clarification is GREAT and is never dumb. I think those are 
					the types of questions professors are referring to when they say, 
					“There is no such thing as a dumb question.”

				<h3>
					Participate in Class
				</h3>

				<p>
					On the first day of every class you’ll get a class syllabus that 
					contains lots of great information: class schedule, assignments, 
					honor code guidelines, and the grading system. Find the section 
					titled “Class Participation.” Class participation can constitute up 
					to 25 percent of your grade. In other words, it can move you a 
					letter grade up or down, so don’t take it lightly. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					A common misconception about class participation is that

				<p>
					“every student gets an A in class participation.” One day before 
					class, I was setting up my computer and I overheard students 
					in the front row of the class discussing and calculating hypothetical final grades. One student said, “Assuming I get an A 
					in class participation, I’ll get a B in this class.” He said this 
					right in front of me! I asked him why in the world he would 
					assume an A, and he responded, “I don’t know, I guess I just 
					assumed that students get A’s in class participation.” So I asked 
					the class if they all assumed that class participation was an easy 
					A and most agreed. The class was mostly freshmen, and I was 
					grateful that one sophomore raised her hand and said, “That 
					is absolutely not true.” 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Every semester after that incident, I explained to my classes 
					that I didn’t give away A’s in class participation and that students had to earn them. I also communicated what it takes to 
					earn an A and that I would happily give every one of them an 
					A if they met my criteria. At the end of every semester I’d have 
					at least one student in my office begging for an A in participation (it was 20 percent of my grade). It was always a student 
					who never spoke up in class and never came prepared. Why 
					on earth would I give that student an A? I couldn’t with a clear 
					conscience. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Getting an A in class participation is easy if you do the 
					following: 
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Show up “reasonably” prepared.</strong> I included the word “reasonably” because I understand you can’t always complete 
						all of the reading prior to a class. But you can read enough 
						to understand the subject matter and engage in the class 
						discussion. 
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Ask a question.</strong> Not just any random question. Think of 
						something you read and would really like some clarity or 
						perspective on. There’s always at least one thing you won’t 
						completely understand.
					</li>
				</ul>

				</div>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Offer an alternative opinion.</strong> In classes that are heavy on 
						debate, such as ethics, history, or political science, the class as 
						a whole will often have a dominant opinion. Offer an alternative view. It adds to the health of a discussion. Let’s say you’re 
						discussing a difficult and heated issue like the U.S. invasion of 
						Iraq in 2003. The class will likely develop a tilt in one direction or the other in the first few minutes of the discussion. 
						Consider offering an opposing view. Even if you don’t agree 
						with the view, you can offer a different perspective. Professors 
						love a healthy debate, and the learning for everyone grows 
						from this type of interaction.
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Know your professors.</strong> Perhaps I should have said make 
						sure they know you. Your interaction with your professors 
						will be minimal (roughly three hours a week). Introduce yourself at some point. Stop by during their office hours at least 
						once. Professors are human, and connecting with them (without pestering) goes a long way. (I do not recommend trying 
						to squeeze this in right after class when they’re surrounded 
						by a swarm of students.)
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="indent">
					Participating in class is easy, and it will serve you well. Not 
					only will it ensure you earn an A in class participation, but 
					you’ll be more engaged and consequently learn more. Even if 
					the class doesn’t have a class participation grade, the proactive 
					habits you’re applying are making you a better student.

					Staying Organized Saves Time
				</h3>

				<p>
					Staying organized for each of your classes is crucial because it 
					will cut down on your study time. There are multiple strategies 
					for staying organized, and strategic students will experiment 
					to find what works best for them. When I interviewed students 
					about this subject, I learned that the most successful students 
					had a system of staying organized, though none of the systems 
					were identical in their entirety. The students agreed, however,

				<p>
					that having a good system cut down on their study time, which 
					is what all students strive for. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					When I returned to school as a freshman, I met with three 
					other students one afternoon at 5 p.m. to study Chemistry 101. 
					I watched the other students unload their books and notes. 
					Two of these students shuffled through stacks and laptops and 
					grumbled phrases like, “Does anyone have the handout from 
					last week?” They didn’t start actually studying until 5:30 p.m. 
					Being disorganized cost them 30 minutes. That may not sound 
					like much but, let’s assume these students are taking multiple 
					classes and they’re equally disorganized in those other classes. 
					They’re losing around 5 hours a week due to disorganization. 
					This assumption is based on 20 hours of weekly studying split 
					into 10, two-hour sessions. The third student had everything 
					she needed laid out in front of her and started studying right 
					away. This student also left earlier than the others to meet 
					up with friends. Being organized probably saved her 5 hours 
					a week. If she used that additional time to study, that’s a 10-hour difference from her disorganized classmates. What an 
					advantage! And she’s going out to have fun while they continue 
					working.

				<p class="indent">
					Strategies that help you organize your materials for maximum

				<p class="indent">
					Every organized student I ever met arranges materials in 
					the order they are received in class. Human memory typically 
					associates events with other events. It’s more common to say 
					something along the lines of, “I remember that concert—it was 
					the night of the Nebraska-Colorado game” than, “I remember 
					that concert—it was October 4th.” When you keep your materials in order, you won’t have any problems finding them because

					you’ll associate the items with a timeframe or another event. If 
					I asked, “Where are those notes Professor Smith gave you the 
					first week of school?” you’d reply, “Right in the first few pages 
					of my notebook,” that is, if you organized them chronologically.

				<h3>
					Use a three-hole punch and three-ring binder
				</h3>

				<p>
					Most classes still have some paper materials. Paper is easy to 
					organize; all you need is a three-ring binder and a three-hole 
					punch. Every time you get a handout or take notes or receive 
					a graded assignment, date it, punch it, and binder it in chronological order. Three-hole binders are the best because you can 
					insert your graded assignments in the location associated with 
					when you completed them (it may be weeks after you completed an assignment before your professor returns it). You can 
					also put dates on your assignments that you hand in in order 
					to quickly determine a notebook location when the assignment 
					is returned.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					If you’re using computer files such as Microsoft Office files for 
					notes and other things, you can organize these chronologically 
					as well. Simply create a class folder and title your files with a 
					date name, such as “01_23_Class Notes.docx.” Now you can sort 
					your files to list in chronological order. I use numbered dates 
					instead of month names because month names are not alphabetized and I want to be able to sort my files to read in order 
					(Figure 5.1). Don’t depend on the date tags on your computer 
					to organize your files because they update each time you open 
					a file, which can cause lots of confusion.

					Let Your Professor Take Your Notes
				</h3>

				<p>
					I almost titled this section “Take as Few Notes as Possible” but 
					I thought that might be misleading even though it’s a good goal. 
					Professors are becoming increasingly technologically savvy and 
					that means less note taking for you in class. When I returned to 
					school, I saw many students frantically copying everything the 
					professor had on the board. They were hustling so much that 
					they weren’t engaged in the dialogue or even really listening. 
					In most of those classes, the digital notes (such as a Microsoft 
					Power Point presentation) had already been posted online by 
					the professor, yet the students still felt compelled to copy them 
					down. What a waste of time and energy. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					The following technological platforms are a sample of what 
					professors are using today. Let them work for you. If your professors are not using these items, ask them if they’d be willing

					your own, thereby minimizing how much note taking you have

					Note Taking: Digital versus Handwritten
				</h3>

				<p>
					Note taking is not a talent; it’s a skill that anyone can learn. It’s 
					also personal, and no one style will fit everyone’s needs, though 
					I have noticed a few commonalities among effective students. 
					The most important theme I’ve noticed is that effective note 
					takers generally use two different strategies: one for qualitative

					classes (digital) and one for quantitative classes (handwritten).
					Qualitative classes are reading, writing, and discussion 
					orientated. Quantitative classes are math and problem-solving 
					focused. Each type of class requires a distinct strategy and the 
					two strategies can’t be used interchangeably. After testing various
					strategies, I found the following guidelines to work well.

				<h3>
					Note-taking in qualitative classes
				</h3>

				<p>
					Qualitative classes are nontechnical; therefore, your notes will 
					stem from verbal discussion. I recommend typing notes in these 
					classes. Any word-processing or note-taking program will do. 
					Some students like OneNote (Microsoft). I personally like Word 
					(Microsoft). Each class will be different in terms of teaching 
					style and content. You’ll have to adapt, but the habits described 
					here will help you do that.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					So you have your laptop open in class. You’ve turned off 
					Facebook, Twitter, IM, and other media programs and your 
					blank document is open and ready to go. Turning off your auto 
					format will prevent needless automatic editing in class. You are 
					not concerned with spelling and grammar, you are concerned 
					with speed. Therefore auto-formatting cues will be a burden for 
					you in class. You can always turn it back on later.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Professors in almost all qualitative classes lead lectures and 
					discussions with QUESTIONS. They start the class with a question and
					they drop questions throughout. These questions aren’t 
					random. Your professor has an hour to hit a certain number of 
					topics, and those questions are designed to keep things on track. 
					Every time your professor asks a new question, type it into 
					your computer. Getting the question down is most important. 
					Even if you don’t hear the answer, you can always research the 
					answer later. Or ask for the professor during his office hours 
					or in the next class. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Questions are followed by answers, right? True but in qualitative
					classes there often are no right answers. Classes such as

				<p>
					political science or literature encourage opinion and debate. You 
					will not be graded on your opinions; you will be graded on your 
					delivery of the evidence you use to support your opinions. So 
					under the question you type, make note of facts that support 
					both sides of an argument. Don’t assume you’ll be able choose 
					the side of an argument on a test. You may have to argue 
					multiple perspectives so take notes that include “for,” “against,” 
					and all other alternative perspectives.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					For example, let’s say you’re in an economics class arguing 
					the virtue of U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson’s Troubled 
					Asset Relief Program (TARP) in October of 2008. The TARP program proposed that the U.S. Treasury would acquire up to $700 
					billion worth of mortgage-backed securities and is controversial 
					because it represented the U.S. government aiding private banks 
					(who were accused of causing the problem to begin with). A 
					class question may be, “Was the implementation of TARP an 
					effective strategy in the effort to relieve America’s recession?” 
					That’s a controversial question and one that’s difficult to prove 
					either way. There are only two possible answers: yes or no. The 
					answer doesn’t matter; the evidence you choose to support your 
					answer is where you make your money (no pun intended).
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					I like professors. They’re the stars of the show. And like most 
					stars, they’re great communicators. They use both verbal and 
					nonverbal language to communicate emotion. As note taker, you 
					can use this language as a “give away.” Many times, professors 
					ask a question, then immediately answer the question. That’s 
					verbal communication. When a professor asks a question and 
					students answer the question via debates and/or discussion,
					<em>notice whether the professor is saying yes or nodding in agreement.</em>
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Many students only note what professors say and ignore 
					their classmates’ points. In the class I taught, if a student made 
					a key point that I thought that was great, she did my job for 
					me. I’d simply communicate that it was an excellent point. Pay 
					attention to your classmates, and take note of your professor’s

				<p>
					verbal cues and body language. That’s it. Format and style are 
					all subjective to the note-taker. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Professors don’t only communicate in class via questions. As 
					a note-taker you need to capture these themes as well. You 
					can use the same page of notes to capture these points. Keep a 
					keen ear open for your professor stating the following phrases 
					(or similar):
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					“It’s important to note”
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					“Key point”
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					“Very important”
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					The benefits of typing notes are speed in recording information and ease of editing. The main benefit of speed is that you 
					get more down in less time, thus increasing your listening time. 
					Another benefit of typing is your ability to edit, augment, and 
					organize the material later. Some students like to “tidy up” their 
					notes or even put them into an outline form. With a digital 
					file, you can do this very easily. Handwritten notes are nearly 
					impossible to do this with unless you’re willing to spend hours 
					transcribing notes.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Typing also sets you up to make a nice study guide. You’re 
					likely going to be taking notes not only in class but also from 
					your book, articles, and perhaps other research. As you get 
					closer to exam time, you merge your notes into one study guide 
					(Figure 5.4). With digital files, you can quickly copy and paste 
					notes from multiple sources into one study guide. Don’t cut and 
					paste everything—just highlights, key points, and definitions. 
					Organize your notes under common topics. The night before 
					a test, your study guide and practice test(s) (if you have them) 
					are the only things you should be looking at. Can you imagine 
					doing this by hand? Impossible. With a computer, it takes only 
					minutes.

					Note taking in quantitative classes
				</h3>

				<p>
					Taking notes in technical classes that involve mathematical 
					problem solving is much more difficult than in nontechnical 
					classes. I have yet to find a way to avoid writing notes by hand 
					in these classes. The best supplements to handwritten notes are 
					the interactive whiteboard files (usually a PDF file). For now let’s 
					assume that your professor is NOT using an interactive whiteboard. There’s no way around it: bring your pencil (not pen) 
					and paper and be ready to copy sample problems. One reason 
					quantitative classes are so hard to take notes in is because of 
					the symbology used. Numbers, Greek letters, arrows, and lots 
				</p>

					of steps are the norm in math and science classes. Another 
					reason is that many professors get messy quickly (especially 
					math and science professors). They try to squeeze lots of steps 
					onto a whiteboard or some other similar medium and it can 
					get chaotic up there. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					I recommend two steps for note taking in these technical 
					problem-solving-type classes. The first step is to note the subject 
					matterthe problem is testing. For example, let’s say you’re in 
					physics class and your professor starts the class with the following problem:
				</p>

				<br />

				<p class="indent center">
					<em>A golf ball is moving to the right at 50 m/s and it strikes another golf ball moving to the left at 75 m/s. Determine speed 
					and direction of both balls after the collision.</em>
				</p>

				<br />

				<p class="indent">
					Start your note taking by annotating what subject matter 
					is being tested. In this case, you’d note something along the 
					lines of “Kinetic Energy, Collisions, and/or Conservation of 
					Momentum.” Don’t worry about filling in notes on that subject 
					in class—you can go back to your book and review theories 
					and take notes. Always know what subject matter a problem is 
					before starting it. This will come back and benefit you tenfold 
					come test time.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					The second note taking step is to <em>copy practice problem(s).</em>
					Copy problems in steps. Professors often won’t write what step 
					they’re on while problem solving but will say it. Most students 
					copy only what is on the board. Make note of the steps being 
					completed. This is almost more important than the problem 
					because you can find sample problems later and apply the right 
					steps. Other than that … copy, copy, copy. Get the steps written 
					down even if you don’t understand them. Copy now and learn 
					later if necessary. Try and write neatly so that you can redo 
					practice problems later. One of my best students would rewrite 
					the problem neatly right after class while the lessons were fresh.
				</p>

					Come test time, he had no problem reviewing. His notes were 
					organized and legible. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					So for quantitative classes there are few shortcuts (which is 
					probably why they have a reputation for being so hard). Your 
					note taking sets up your studying. Step one is to understand 
					what concepts the problem is addressing. Step two is to apply 
					the correct steps. Following this thought process in your note 
					taking creates a very effective test-taking thought process. As 
					you can see, you’re note taking with the end goal of easier 
					studying for your test. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					I still recommend consolidating notes for quantitative classes 
					although it is significantly more difficult to do. You can either 
					hand copy notes or scan copies of problems. Hand copying has 
					the benefit of being able to neaten up your notes; however, it 
					is time consuming. Scanning is fast but you get an exact copy 
					of your notes which may be messy.

				<div class="indentedSection top">
					<h3>
						Consolidate Your Notes
					</h3>

					<p>
						The goal of consolidating your notes is to have a concise outline to
						study in the days prior to your test. During your studies you’ll have information from multiple 
						sources (textbook, class, research, etc.). Consolidating your notes
						has tremendous benefits, including saving you time. Remember, you’re consolidating only the 
						big ideas and important memory items to review, such 
						as a sample problem that’s representative of a type of 
						problem your professor uses. Or, maybe you’ll list bullet points presenting sides of an argument. The night 
						before an exam you should NOT be reading chapters 
						or learning any new material. You should be reviewing 
						your outline and perhaps looking at practice tests.

					What to do When You Don’t Have a Great Professor
				</h3>

				<p>
					It’s inevitable that at some point you will have a class taught by 
					a professor who is simply not an effective teacher. So how do 
					you handle this? Many students become angry and openly criticize the professor’s shortcomings. This approach will get you 
					nowhere because your GPA will never have footnotes explaining 
					that you had a few bad professors. You are still responsible for 
					your GPA and you can’t share it with your professors.
				</p>

				<p class="indnet">
					Strategic students adapt and overcome a poor professor. They 
					develop a new plan and they move forward without wasting any 
					time blaming. The first step is to identify what is missing in the 
					professor. The second step is to fill in the shortcoming with a 
					secondary resource. For example I had one student, Eric, who 
					said to me, “My calculus professor doesn’t assign any homework 
					so the class doesn’t know what type of problems will be on the 
					test.” Not assigning homework problems that guide the students’ 
					studying was a shortcoming for this particular professor. The 
					passive student will take that methodology to mean that he 
					doesn’t have any homework and his test results will be negative. 
					A strategic student will acknowledge the shortcoming and then 
					take action. 
				</p>

				<p class="indnet">
					In this particular situation, Eric went to the professor’s office hours with his book open and said, “Would you mind 
					circling problems that you think would be good to practice?” 
					The professor agreed and now Eric had a problem set that the 
					rest class did not. Eric also went a step further and went to 
					another calculus professor’s office hours and asked the same

					question and further increased his practice problem set. Eric

					Summary
				</h3>

				<p>
					Effective in-class habits eliminate unnecessary study time. Class 
					time in college is NOT where most of your learning takes place. 
					This is the biggest academic difference from high school and 
					military learning. In class, remind yourself that you’re learning 
					what you need to learn. This theme will help you streamline 
					your note taking and organizational methods so that studying 
					for exams will be easier and more effective. Working smarter, 
					not harder, is the goal. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Your professor will deliver a one-size-fits-all message because 
					he or she is teaching the class as whole and not any one individual. Knowing this will allow you to strategically receive and 
					customize that message as a foundation for your study time. 
					So many factors affect the quality of your class time: time of 
					day, seating location, note taking, and technology to name a 
					few. The good news is that you can control most of these factors and maximize your learning by employing the strategies 
					discussed in this chapter. While your professor is delivering 
					one message to the class, the individuals in the class are not 
					receiving the message equally. Reception has nothing to do 
					with mental aptitude; it has everything to with setting yourself 
					up to effectively receive and organize the inbound information 
					to utilize in your study sessions.
