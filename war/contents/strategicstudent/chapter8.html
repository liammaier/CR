				Veterans especially struggle with writing. I believe this is 
				because while the military can be academically demanding 
				there is very little writing necessary until your reach a high level 
				of seniority. As a result, oftentimes veterans have not written a 
				paper in many years. There is no avoiding writing in college (or 
				life); it is an essential skill. It also requires mastering important 
				skills because papers are worth so much credit—they can really 
				make or break your grade in a class. I assigned one paper in 
				the class I taught and it was worth 25 percent of the final grade.

				I’ve often heard students share sentiments such as, “I’m a 
				good writer” or “I’m not a good writer,” as if their writing ability 
				had been defined at birth. Those feelings stem in part from the 
				quality of writing training the students received in high school 
				and earlier. I received no writing training in the military and 
				the chances are unless you were a journalist, neither did you. 
				Like so many other skills, writing can be cultivated with guidance and

				<h3>
					Paper Writing Do’s and Don’ts 
				</h3>

				<p>
					On the first day of class you’ll most likely receive a syllabus 
					that will include the paper assignments for the semester. Many 
					students will ignore this information because the due dates 
					seem far away. <em>The key to writing an A paper lies in starting 
					early and employing resources around you.</em> Marking the due 
					date on your calendar is the first step, but you’ll also want to 
					set up a writing schedule that keeps you on track. Here’s my 
					general philosophy on paper writing:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>	
						Multiple, short writing sessions produce a high-quality paper.
					</li>

					<li>
						Long writing sessions produce a low-quality paper. 
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="indent">
					Sound familiar? Paper writing is like studying—marathon 
					studying is much less effective than short interval studying. 
					Similarly, writing turns out sloppy if you try and do it all at 
					once. Yet when you schedule writing as a process of intervals 
					over time, the results are dramatically better. This is why you 
					have to personalize a writing plan that suits your schedule. 
					Establishing daily and weekly objectives—what you intend to 
					achieve—will help get your paper written on time and any other 
					deliverables your professor may expect from you. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Scheduling writing during weeks you don’t have any other 
					tests or commitments ensures that you have adequate, consecutive blocks of time to make progress on your paper. Your

				</div>

				<p class="indent">
					Another benefit to starting early is that it gets you thinking 
					about the topic. Valuable thought-development sessions can 
					occur at the gym, on the bus, or even walking across campus. 
					“Incubation” time is essential to developing thoughts; if you wait 
					until the last minute, you end up just typing, not communicating. If you procrastinate too long before starting a paper, you’ll 
					feel rushed, your thoughts will be underdeveloped, and your 
					grade will reflect that.

				<h3>
					Length of papers 
				</h3>

				<p>
					Most professors give a page range for an assigned paper. For 
					example, I assigned a paper that was to run three to five pages. 
					There’s absolutely no correlation between longer papers and 
					higher grades. Many students believe that the more they write, 
					the more likely they are to get a higher grade. A great paper is a 
					great paper regardless of length. Likewise, when I was reading 
					a lousy paper, I never thought, “Wow, this paper is really bad; 
					I hope it goes on longer.” Sometimes, less is more. If you need 
					five pages to make your point, by all means use it, but if you 
					can do it in three, that’s fine, too. Never go over the required 
					maximum—it’s there for a reason. Grading papers is the most 
					time-consuming task professors do, so don’t waste their time 
					… they’ll appreciate that.

			<section class="subsection" data-number="3" data-name="The Writing Process">

				<h3>
					The Writing Process
				</h3>

				<p>
					Writing a paper occurs in stages. Before you even begin writing, 
					a number of important steps should be taken first. Many students
					think they’re not making progress until they actually start 
					writing. This is far from the truth—you’re setting yourself up 
					for an A paper, not just a completed paper. Below is a 5-point 
					plan for writing a winning paper, from selecting your topic to 
					proofreading your final version.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<strong>1. Select a topic</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					Early into the semester, schedule a short meeting with your professor
					during his or her office hours. Present a written topic and 
					a few general ideas in regards to developing your main theme. 
					Not only will your professor be impressed that you’re starting 
					so early (that alone is a victory), but the meeting could potentially
					save you from spending weeks on a topic your professor 
					thinks is not a good one. During the meeting, your professor 
					will help you refine your objectives and possible structure. You 
					can even ask your professor about particular writing or research 
					resources that would be useful.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<strong>2. Begin your research</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					Researching is so easy that your biggest problem is going to 
					be narrowing down the sea of information to a few carefully 
					chosen resources. Research does NOT constitute Googling information and calling it a day. Professors are also keenly aware 
				</p>

				<p>
<!-- Page 159 -->

				<div class="pagebreak">

				<p>
					of Wikipedia and its content. Wikipedia is a fine resource for 
					some general ideas but keep in mind who authors wikis — 
					anybody. Professors prefer professional sources of research such 
					as journals, magazine articles, and books. Seek out sources of 
					research in which the author is an expert in his or her field. 
					Researching in general means reading other people’s thoughts 
					as a means to developing your own. Read, take notes, and think 
					about what direction to head in.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<strong>3. Brainstorm</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					You haven’t written one page yet you’ve completed a great 
					deal toward your paper thus far. I recommend brainstorming 
					using a word processing or spreadsheet document. Here’s one 
					technique a student, Erik, showed me that I thought was brilliant. Erik used text boxes in a Microsoft Word file to jot down 
					ideas in the form of subject categories and subcategories from 
					his research. By placing ideas in boxes, Erik could move them 
					around into different outline progressions until one suited him, 
					kind of like if they were magnets on a board. With this method 
					you don’t have to think or plan in a linear format yet (such as 
					an outline) which can hinder creativity. Let’s look at a simple 
					example. For his film history class, Erik is going to argue that 
					Martin Scorsese is the most influential filmmaker ever. His initial brainstorm is shown in Figure 8.1.

						Figure 8.1: <em>Erik’s ideas are in no particular order just yet. He can do

					</p>
				</figure>
						
				<p class="indent">
					Obviously Erik’s thoughts are not fully flushed out, but now 
					he can move them around, add, or eliminate material until his 
					main themes and arguments start to emerge. 
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<strong>4. Create an outline</strong>
				</p>

				<p>					
					You’ve settled on a flow via your brainstorming exercise, and 
					now it’s time to elaborate on your thoughts. Use your brainstorm to convert your ideas into a linear outline in a word 
					processing program such as Microsoft Word. A linear outline 
					will put your ideas into the order that the paper will read and 
					you can elaborate on each theme that you want to communicate. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Now is also the time to decide on your primary sources of 
					research. I recommend using multiple sources of research to fully 
					develop your arguments and message. As a general rule, I recommend using at least one resource for every page of the paper. For 
					example a five page paper should utilize at least five resources. 
				</p>

						</span>
					</p>
				</div>
	
				<p class="indent">
					When your outline is complete, make another appointment 
					with your professor to discuss your outline. Tell her what you’ve 
					discovered in your research and how it’s affecting your objectives. Her feedback will either support you in the direction 
					you’re taking or will get you to think about other perspectives. 
					Professors typically love to offer guidance when asked, but few 
					students take the initiative to ask. Professors have a wealth of 
					experience and expertise, and you can benefit greatly by tapping into this.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Here’s a strategy question: if your professor has helped guide 
					you in your paper writing and you implemented the changes 
					she suggested, is she more likely to give you a high grade or a 
					low grade? The answer should be obvious.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<strong>5. Write the paper</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					Now it’s time to state your topic and elaborate on your supporting ideas. Using your detailed outline, which lists the sources 
					you’ll cite, you’ll be surprised how easily this step unfolds. 
					Don’t aim for perfection on your first draft. It’s much more 
					important to just get the information down. When the paper 
					seems fairly complete, put it away. After a day or two, review it 
					carefully, looking to tighten your sentences, embellish or delete 
					as needed, and fix typos. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Seek a reader for your paper. This could be your teaching 
					assistant (TA), graduate student, or even another well respected 
					student (perhaps one majoring in writing). Ask them for their 
					feedback. Utilizing an outside reader will help you see problems 
					that you have missed because you are so close to the paper that 
					it’s difficult to be completely objective.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					The main theme of this paper-writing methodology is you 
					are including your professor in the process. Professors want to 
					help you and this is why they have office hours. None of these 
					steps will be required but the likelihood of you scoring a high 
					grade is significantly higher than if you went at it as a solo 
				</p>

				<p>
					pursuit. From a time-management perspective this didn’t take 
					you any more time. Writing requires multiple steps to produce 
					a high quality paper and the actual writing and editing of the 
					paper is the final step.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					If English is your second language, the difficulty of writing 
					is magnified, however; you can overcome this obstacle. Most 
					campuses have a center for international students and often 
					have writing workshops as part of their services. It is worth a 
					call or visit to the center to utilize this resource. The 5-point 
					writing steps I delineated above will work for international students too, however; when English is your second language, the 
					editing process will take a slightly longer amount of time and 
					you can benefit from utilizing multiple reviewers of your paper. 
				</p>

				<div class="indentedSection top bottom">

					<h3>
						Campus Resources
					</h3>

					<p>
						There are so many helpful resources on campus when it 
						comes to writing. My favorites are the English and writing departments. Most writing departments host open 
						proofreading hours or even offer tutoring appointments 
						available to all students at the school. Some schools will 
						even require graduate students to work a few hours a 
						week in this capacity. This is an amazing opportunity to 
						get some expert eyes on your paper. 
					</p>

					<p class="indent">
						Little known fact: you don’t need to be an English or 
						writing major to utilize those resource centers. I had a 
						political science student who loved to walk over to the 
						English department and have a tutor look at his papers. 
						Once again, though, no one will tell you about these 
						resources, nor will they seek you out. I recommend that 
						you finish your paper a week or two early and seek out 
						one of these departments. In other words, don’t swing 
						by the department the day before your paper is due.

					Summary
				</h3>

				<p>
					There are many different types of papers written in college. 
					The basic steps in this chapter will get you pointed in the 
					right direction and are applicable to almost all research-style 
					papers. The key ingredient to success presented in this chapter is that you are employing the professor as a partner (this 
					helps with getting to know your professor too). As soon as 
					you get your writing assignment, begin to plan your schedule 
					to ensure you’ll have adequate time to complete all the steps 
					needed to produce a great paper. Many fine books and online 
					resources exist on the topic of writing, and I encourage you 
					to explore those for specific techniques to help improve your 
					skills. Additionally, your campus will have writing experts in 
					the English department and I encourage you to seek them 
					out. However, I’m confident that if you set out by heeding the 
					suggestions presented in this chapter, you’ll be on your way to 
					becoming a confident and effective writer who will score high 
					grades on paper assignments.
