				<span class="firstLetter">W</span>hile serving as an assistant professor of naval science and 
				a freshman academic advisor at the University of Colorado, 
				Boulder, 2004–2007, I became aware of a very real problem 
				occurring in higher education: students are simply not learning the mindset and habits needed to transition successfully 
				from high school or the military to college. Veteran’s often 
				assume that these issues will be addressed at freshman orientation, but most of the orientation is focused on navigating the 
				school—think meal plans, registration, campus security, and so 
				on. Many veterans rightfully feel as though freshmen orientation 
				doesn’t address their needs. Veterans have already left home 
				and developed a strong work ethic. They don’t need a lecture 
				on underage drinking and yet they’re asked to sit through one. 
				Veterans are equipped to receive lessons on academic strategy 
				but most schools are not delivering it to them. Even if a short 
				session is offered during orientation on transitioning to college 
				academics, students are distracted and not prepared at that 
				time to absorb these lessons. Students at freshmen orientation 
				are focused on two things: making friends and navigating their 
				school.

				I completely understand why veterans are frustrated with the 
				current state of college orientation. Veterans already understand 
				that strategy is taught before battle not during. I wanted to

				assemble a set of strategies that I could teach students before
				they got to college, which would help ensure their academic 
				success. This may sound simplistic but when you arrive at your 
				college, college begins. It’s game time! The semester train will 
				start rolling with or without you. It’s not your school’s job to 
				teach you how to transition or how to study. It’s their job to 
				teach you subject matter and to offer support resources.

				I pondered for a long time why students struggled so much 
				with their transition to college life before it dawned on me 
				that the answers rested with the students I met with every day. 
				What I needed to do was collect, organize, and test the “data” 
				and ultimately translate it into an action plan. So I decided to 
				examine traits of both successful and unsuccessful students. 
				What I found was that successful students shared similar traits 
				and unsuccessful students shared similar traits—and that success in college is not the result of brains alone; rather, it has 
				much more to do with mindset and habits. 
			</p>

			<p class="indent">
				I believe both mindset and habits can be taught, practiced, 
				and refined. I’ve seen students change their mindset and habits, 
				and as a result they turn academic struggles into successes. 
				I was one of those students, and interviewing hundreds of 
				students and subsequently testing these strategies on myself 
				confirmed my research. I know for a fact that I’m not a brilliant 
				person, but by using the strategies I collected, I truly accelerated my ability to learn and score higher grades.
			</p>

			<p class="indent">
				In all sincerity I wish someone had taken the time to teach 
				me these lessons when I was eighteen. A major motivation for 
				writing this book is that I hate seeing students feel defeated by 
				their freshmen year academics. I’m unsatisfied with college attrition amongst our nation’s veterans. I have seen the confidence 
				of too many college students unnecessarily destroyed. I’d like 
				to tell every student who under-achieves that it’s NOT because 
				they’re not smart enough. It’s simply that they never learned 
				to navigate their new academic environment. A predominant

				message in <em>The Strategic Student</em> is knowing that A’s are within 
				your reach if you’re strategic and consistent. Yes, you absolutely 
				have to work hard to succeed but not so hard that you’re not 
				having fun doing it.

				It’s not your branch’s job to teach you how to transition to college.
				High schools have their plate full with all the requirements 
				necessary for you to graduate. That’s why students prepare for 
				the SAT on their own time. Furthermore, high schools can only 
				do so much. The reason I remind you of your high school’s or 
				college’s job is because ultimately the responsibility of planning 
				your strategy falls on your shoulders. This type of solo pursuit 
				can be uncomfortable with veterans, but trust me, it gets easier 
				with time.

				I was a hands-on freshmen advisor yet I felt my time was 
				always limited in how much I could guide my students. 
				Consequently, I learned I had to teach them to own their education.
				OWN YOUR EDUCATION is my mantra and the essence 
				of this book. It’s also a requirement in college. In high school, 
				ownership is shared between you, your teachers, counselors, 
				coaches, and family. These people still exist in college but 
				they’re not watching over you and you have to enlist their support.
				“Owning your education” means that you accept much of 
				the responsibility that these people assumed while you were 
				in high school. Many students really struggle with transitioning to
				college life, but any student can build a strategic mental 
				framework for approaching academics. By reading this book, 
				you’ve already started and you deserve credit for being proactive.
				This is precisely what I mean by taking ownership. Don’t 
				feel bad if all the lessons in this book don’t make sense yet. 
				My hope is that at this point you realize that your potential is 
				unlimited BUT only if it is properly harnessed.

				If you are currently a college student and you are reading 
				this book after struggling a bit in college, I am glad you are

				getting back in the fight. We are all entitled second chances and 
				everybody loves a comeback story. If you are job seeking or 
				applying to graduate school your hill is steeper but your goals 
				are very much still achievable. Break the cycle and show the

				On the TV show <em>The Biggest Loser</em>, overweight people are 
				struggling to lose pounds but more importantly they are trying to
				get a healthy life back. Success for these contestants is 
				defined as obtaining a healthy weight (and potentially winning 
				one million dollars). What is the first thing their trainers do 
				with the contestants? Convince them of the need to “track.” The 
				contestants all track their calories throughout the day—the calories
				they take in and the calories they burn. Tracking is a key 
				to success. One of the smartest habits you can adopt in college 
				is to track your study hours because it’s often too late to pull 
				up your grades by the time you receive your grades. Estimating 
				and tracking your study time will guide you toward balance 
				and success in college. It takes a minute a day and saves you 
				an invaluable amount of time, stress, and heartache. Working 
				hard is great; working balanced and smart is much better.

				Universities are designed to deliver information. In a one-sizefits-all
				approach, your school will recommend how much study 
				time you should devote to each class—without knowing your 
				aptitude or goals. By taking ownership of your college education, you’ll
				want to customize your study plan. Your school will 
				also assign homework problems. You can do these assignments 
				as given, or you can use the homework as a guideline while 
				customizing the assignments to improve your weaker areas. 
				I recommend customizing the assignments if they won’t be 
				graded. Customizing is gathering up all that great education that 
				your university is delivering and personalizing it to maximize 
				your strengths and minimize your weaknesses.

				student who’s been struggling, I encourage you to reread the

				The reason I’m so passionate about helping students excel 
				in college is because I know the strategies presented in this 
				book work; after all, I interviewed hundreds of students and 
				tested the theories on myself. I also know they’ll work for 
				you. The proper mindset, self-reliance, and effective time-management skills level the playing field in college and once you 
				know that, you’ll realize your goals are completely achievable. 
				Congratulations on taking the first steps toward owning your 
				education. Success in college is not a birth right; it’s a decision. 
				I wish you many victories throughout your academic career 
				and beyond. I would also like to sincerely thank-you for your 
				service. I know that your service will continue in a new form 
				long after your graduation from college.
