				<h3>
					Inefficient Time-Management Practices
				</h3>

				<p>
					Before we look at the best practices for time management, let’s 
					look at three of the most common, though highly ineffective, 
					practices that students use for studying: event-driven studying, sporadic studying, and studying until you “feel good.” My 
					purpose in pointing out these inefficiencies is to help you steer 
					clear of them at all costs! It can be tempting to look around your 
					freshmen dorm and simply follow the crowd. Your reward is 
					during midterms and at the end of the semester when everyone 
					else is using words like “cramming” and “all-nighter.” These are 
					the words of unprepared students who are dead in the water 
					and don’t even know it yet. During finals and midterms, these 
					students will be wondering why you seemingly don’t study 
					that much and don’t appear too stressed. In fact, you should 
					never have to resort to marathon study sessions, and I’ll show 
					you why.

				<h3>
					Event-driven studying
				</h3>

				<p>
					Most freshmen will study based on events immediately in front 
					of them. For example, let’s say a student has a chemistry test 
					this Thursday and nothing due in any other classes. This week 
					that student will likely study exclusively for chemistry. Although 
					many freshmen do well at first using this approach and actually 
					get a few good grades, the approach starts a negative ripple 
					effect that won’t be realized until further down the road. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					If you devote all your time to one class, you ignore your 
					other classes for a period of time. So the next week you ignore 
					chemistry and study for your economics test, and then the 
					next week you switch over to another class, and so on. Now 
					when your second chemistry test rolls around, a few weeks 
					will have passed where you haven’t looked at chemistry. This 
					is a tremendous problem because it’s going to take significant 
					time to review and get your rhythm back. You may even have

					to refresh your knowledge of material that’s a few weeks old 
					yet necessary to know for today’s material. Moreover, if you’ve 
					sat in class for a few weeks without having read the assigned 
					material, you’ve spent even more time ineffectively.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					What happens if you have multiple graded events in the 
					same week or heaven forbid on the same day? When you have 
					a week with multiple graded evolutions like a paper due, a test, 
					and a project, you are in serious trouble. There’s no way to 
					catch up. An events-driven approach to studying is extremely 
					imbalanced and does not allow for multiple-test weeks—which 
					<em>will</em> happen. A balanced approach to studying means that you 
					set aside weekly study time in each one of your classes so that 
					you’ll remain prepared (more on creating a balanced approach 
					later in this chapter).

			<section class="subsection" data-number="3" data-name="Sporadic studying">

				<h3>
					Sporadic studying
				</h3>

				<p>
					Sporadic studying is also a form of imbalance. This imbalance 
					means that students are not distributing the quantity of their 
					studying over the course of the whole semester. It’s feast or famine. Tough weeks are followed by easy weeks. I teach students 
					to spread the work over all fifteen weeks of the semester—to 
					have fifteen “medium” weeks. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Students tend to think that a semester is very long and therefore they’re entitled to warm-up time at the beginning of the 
					semester and down time after a major test or project. In other 
					words, they wind up and they wind down similar to the jagged line in Figure 4.1. This sporadic method would be like a 
					marathon runner sprinting for a mile then walking for mile and 
					repeating until he or she finishes the race. The strategy does not 
					work because it’s an inefficient use of energy and time. Runners, 
					like students, are aiming for efficiency which is why you don’t 
					see a marathon runner ever running a sprint-walk style race. 
					Instead you see evenly paced miles with a slight increase in 
					pace toward the end of the race.

						Students as Tight Rope Walkers

					When I became an experienced pilot in my Navy squadron, I

					can and will mislead you because you have no collegiate frame 
					of reference to base your feelings and instincts on. Don’t feel 
					bad we’ve all been there. When you’re a college senior or even

				<p class="indent">
					Even great students run into problems with going by feel. 
					Top-caliber students may never truly feel good about their preparedness and therefore will keep studying right up until test 
					time. They get a great grade on their test, but they’ve ignored

				<h3>
					What Is Student Time Management? 
				</h3>

				<p>
					Student time management is a system that will help you deal 
					with academic ambiguity and maintain balance between all of 
					your classes. Freshmen students make a common mistake and 
					think that they can go by “feel” because perhaps they did so 
					well in high school. This approach doesn’t work for most and 
					sets many up for failure.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					In high school, you do most of your learning in class. In 
					college, you do most of your learning in your “free time.” In 
					high school you have specific homework assignments and by 
					doing these assignments you solidify classroom learning. Test 
					preparation is built into the system. If you aren’t doing your 
					homework, then you aren’t preparing for tests, and the teacher 
					is onto you. High school is designed to identify at-risk students 
					before problems become too severe. This works well, and we 
					have many amazing high school teachers to thank for executing 
					this system every day. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					College students accept a major level of academic autonomy—often without realizing it. This autonomy is necessary for 
					academic growth, but it’s also largely due to the fact there are

					simply more students (thousands is some cases). Professors 
					don’t have time to be constantly grading assignments—one 
					class can have hundreds of students. In reality, college students 
					don’t even have that many assignments to turn in for grading. 
					This is true even at smaller schools. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Many freshmen students think that time management is 
					added work. Nothing could be further from the truth. <em>The goal 
					of a solid time-management strategy is to streamline your work</em>
					so you spend less time studying. Spending a minute or two a 
					day on time management will actually save you many hours 
					during the week.

					The Strategic Student Time Management System

				<p>
					Many time-management strategies for students involve checklists of tasks and assignments. Making lists of assignments and 
					checking things off is helpful if you have defined homework, 
					but it won’t give you the whole picture and can even mislead 
					you. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					In college there are many periods of time (weeks even) where 
					you may not have specific assignments, projects, or tests. This 
					often gives students a false sense of comfort and free time. The 
					reason this comfort is false is because those classes without 
					assignments still need a steady supply of attention. College is 
					about learning and is not always defined by specific homework 
					assignments. Learning can take the shape of studying, reading, group meetings, practice problems, organizing, and other 
					activities.

				<h3>
					Estimate—Execute—Track—Repeat
				</h3>

				<p>
					The Strategic Student time-management system includes four 
					simple steps: 
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>ESTIMATE: Determine an estimate for weekly study time 
						needed per class.</strong> You won’t find this key step in other timemanagement programs.
						Before the semester starts, you’ll estimate how much study time per week you’ll need for each of 
						your classes. This will give you a goal to track your progress 
						against. I will teach you how to estimate your study hours 
						later in this chapter.
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>EXECUTE: Carry out and focus on “quality” study hours.</strong>
						You’ll learn how to balance the quality of study time with the 
						quantity of study time in this chapter and in Chapter 5.
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>TRACK: Incorporate a method for tracking study hours 
						by class.</strong> Have you ever been lost in a car on a road trip? 
						The first step in reaching your destination is to first figure 
						out where you are currently located. Tracking allows you to 
						compare where you are versus where you want to be. Tracking will also prevent you from getting lost in the first place. A 
						tracking method needs to be simple and not take up much 
						time. The last thing a student needs is another project.
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>REPEAT: Adjust your study plan as the semester moves 
						forward.</strong> Your pre-semester estimate will get you in the 
						ballpark. Now you’re going to fine-tune your study plan in 
						order to even further focus your time allocation. By the end of 
						the semester you’ll have a strong sense of how much time is 
						needed per class every week.

					<h3>
						Time Management: Antidote to Stress
					</h3>

					<p>
						Stress is your mortal enemy in college. You’ll hear students talk about how stressed they are all the time. 
						These are the same students who will wonder why 
						you’re well rested on test day when they spent the night 
						cramming information for ten hours (about one hour of 
						which was effective). Stress inhibits your learning and 
						can cause even highly intelligent students to score low 
						on tests. It’s also preventable. Time management is your 
						most powerful weapon against stress. 
					</p>

					<p class="indent">
						Time management even makes your free time better. 
						Let’s say you’re tracking your study hours and you’re 
						right on schedule in terms of your study plan. Your 
						down time is exactly what it’s supposed to be: relaxing, 
						fun, and re-energizing. But what if you’re not tracking 
						your study hours and you’ve taken a few days off from 
						studying. Now you hear that little nasty voice in the back 
						of your head telling you that the mountain of work is 
						growing and growing. The latter situation is stressful and 
						you’re not really enjoying yourself. You’re actually building more stress during your down time—the complete 
						opposite of what down time should be. Time management doesn’t just help you get higher grades; it makes 
						your free time even better!

						Outstanding grades in college are the result of efficient learning

					books reinforce the same notion. The fact is, it’s about both. I 
					concede that quality is more important, but quantity is not to 
					be neglected. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					To convince students of this, I offer them a challenge. Let’s 
					say there are two students, Tim and Amy. Both students have 
					identical academic aptitude and they’re in the same Biology 
					101 class together. The quality of their study hours is rated 
					using standard letter grades (A, B, C …). Amy studies for ten 
					grade-A-quality hours for the midterm, and Tim studies for 
					one grade-A-quality hour. I then ask the class, “Who do you 
					think will get the higher grade, Tim or Amy?” I always get 100 
					percent votes for Amy. We all agree that the time committed is 
					absolutely correlated to grades. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					To say it’s only about the quality of studying is ridiculous. 
					Don’t let anyone tell you not to study hard; you have to put in 
					your time—you have to be disciplined and study the minimum 
					amount to reach your goal. If your goal is an A, the minimum 
					amount of study time will still be a substantial number of hours 
					(same for a B). Imagine if an Olympic swimmer only trained 
					one day a month and stated, “But it was a really high-quality 
					training session.” I would bet on her to lose every race. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Think of academic success as a three-legged stool: one leg 
					is quantity of study time, one leg is quality of study time, and 
					the third leg is class time. Neglect any one of the three legs and 
					things get very wobbly. Again, I believe that the quality of study 
					hours is the most important leg, but it doesn’t independently 
					make for academic success.

					<h3>
						Time Management Levels the Playing Field
					</h3>

					<p>
						High school segregates classes into levels because 
						they want the whole class to move through material 
						at a similar pace. Classes meet almost every day and 
						tests, homework, and quizzes are very frequent. In high 
						school the “quicker” student has the advantage in terms 
						of scoring high grades. However, in college your class 
						will meet only 2-3 times a week and graded assignments are not nearly as frequent. 
					</p>

					<p class="indent">
						How does this relate to time-management? It doesn’t 
						matter how quickly you learn the material in college as 
						long as you learn it before the graded event (test, quiz, 
						etc.). Who cares if a “more intelligent” student “got it 
						quicker” than you? That quicker student’s only advantage is he or she may have to study less; but you can 
						both get an A. In college you can be less intimidated by 
						that super smart kid from your high school class.
						Let’s look at a quick example: you are in Calculus and 
						you have class on Tuesday and Thursday. It’s Thursday 
						and Marty McSmarty Pants who sits next to you in class 
						really “gets it” right away and you do not. You ask yourself, “Shouldn’t I get it too?” Being the strategic student 
						that you are, you go study at a few intervals over the 
						next four days and by Tuesday you too “get it”. Your 
						slower pace didn’t hurt you because you have the time 
						in college and if you use it strategically you will get to 
						the exact same place as Marty. This is the main reason 
						why I think an A is well within the reach of any student 
						on campus if they are effective managers of time.

					When I was an undergraduate student, almost every professor 
					communicated a recommendation for a number of weekly study 
					hours. It was usually embedded in the syllabus, something 
					worded along the lines of “2 to 3 hours per every hour in 
					class.” When I became a graduate student, the same guideline 
					appeared in many of my classes. This is when I began to scratch 
					my head. How could every class have the same recommendation? And how could a professor know how much I needed 
					to study without knowing me, my aptitude, or my goals? I’ve 
					asked my undergraduate students if I could see their syllabi, 
					and as you can imagine, the same line was often there: <em>Colleges 
					generally recommend 2 to 3 hours of studying per every hour 
					in class.</em> Here are my issues with this rule of thumb.

				<h3>
					Why you should NOT “study 2 to 3 hours for each hour in class” 
				</h3>

				<p>
					<strong>The equation is unrealistic.</strong> If you take only one or two 
					classes, then studying 2 to 3 hours per class hour is doable. 
					However, full-time students usually take four or five classes. 
					The following example shows why the generally recommended 
					studying equation is unrealistic.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Mandy is taking five classes, a normal course load that 
					wouldn’t raise any red flags to her advisor. Each class meets 3 
					hours per week. If Mandy follows the college “rule of thumb,” 
					that means her university is asking her to <em>study 45 hours a 
					week (5 classes x 3 hours class time x 3 hours study time)</em>. Is 
					this realistic? Of course not! Throw in a work-study job, sports 
					practice, club involvement, exercise, maybe even sleep, and 
					there simply isn’t enough time in the week. A <em>strategic student 
					needs to think in terms of his or her whole schedule when forming a study plan.</em> This is a theme I will continue to revisit.

				<p class="indent">
					<strong>Your goals aren’t considered.</strong> When a professor recommends 2 to 3 hours of study time per in-class hour, this number 
					is not correlated to any specific results (grades). Is this advice 
					for students seeking an A? Or are the 2 to 3 hours the average amount of study time, which implies that your goal is 
					the class average? If your goal is to get an A, I’d interpret the 
					rule of thumb to mean you need to study more than the average. However, if you’re taking an elective class pass/fail, you 
					wouldn’t want to study the same amount as you would for the 
					classes in which you’re seeking an A—you’d want to study less
					in order to redirect your time toward studying for the graded 
					classes.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					<strong>The same studying rule won’t work for all classes.</strong> No two 
					students possess the same aptitude, strengths, and weaknesses; 
					every student’s learning needs and styles vary. So to apply the 
					same studying rule to all students in all classes is a one-sizefits-all approach that’s doomed to fail. We are all very different. 
					I’ll use myself as example. I’m a slow reader. I’ve tried various 
					techniques to increase my speed, but this fact remains true. 
					When I was an undergraduate, I probably required more time 
					than the average student to read assignments. But because I’m 
					quick with math, I may have required less time than the average 
					student in math-based classes. The point is that self-assessment 
					is an essential part of determining how much study time you’ll 
					really need. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					If you had infinite time in the week I wouldn’t even discuss 
					this subject. I would recommend studying three hours for every 
					hour in class. But the fact is you are dealing with a limited 
					budget of time which does not allow for a blanket approach to

					Personalizing your study hours 
				</h3>

				<p>
					The strategic student’s goal before registering for classes is to 
					make an assessment of how much studying will be required to 
					reach his or her goals in each class. It’s a difficult task, but it’s 
					a crucial one. It will alert you to the difficulties that lie ahead. 
					If you know what’s coming, it’s much easier to prepare. It will 
					also alert you to the fact that you might be taking too light of 
					a schedule. (Graduate schools don’t like students taking the 
					easy road.) The strategic student is always seeking balance. For 
					example, if you identify that your fall semester is lighter on 
					study time than spring semester, you may decide to schedule 
					volunteer work or extra research time in the fall and focus more 
					on studying in the spring. Perhaps you’ll want to swap a fall 
					class with a spring class. The key is to know (or have an idea) 
					of what’s inbound. You don’t want to find out mid semester 
					that you’re overloaded. An assessment worksheet which will 
					help you determine your personalized study hours is provided 
					later in this chapter.

						Thinking Ahead Saves Money

					<p>
						Students who drop classes past the deadline do NOT

						start and drop a class mid-semester. Every semester 
						I see at least one student drop a class because the 
						student feels “overloaded.” (I’m guilty of having done 
						the same thing in college.) It’s not that these students 
						can’t handle their class; it’s that they can’t handle it 
						with everything else going on in their life. Figure this out

					Determining Your Study-Hour Plan

				<p>
					Calculating a study-hour estimate is a highly individualized

					in person. Don’t expect your advisor to do this; it takes a while, 
					and they have too many students. I was able to do this because I had only about forty ROTC students a semester. While 
					I can’t deliver a single formula applicable to every student, I 
					can, however, discuss the theory behind the process and give 
					you a general blueprint to follow. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					This approach is both quantitative and qualitative. Because 
					the process is so individualized, it also can be time-consuming. 
					Software I’m developing to help students customize their own 
					study plan will take a few seconds and will be more accurate. 
					Until that’s available, you can follow the steps outlined in the 
					next section and do a similar self-assessment. I recommend 
					skimming the section first, thinking about it, and completing 
					the questions after you’ve read the rest of the book, especially 
					Chapter 5: Study Skills. The six steps of the assessment process 
					are:

					Six-step self-assessment process (worksheet to follow)
				</h3>

				<p>
					1. <strong>Assess your aptitude (skills dominance) and interests. </strong>
					The goal of this step is to determine if you’re math/science 
					oriented, reading/writing oriented, or have a “balanced” orientation (equally incorporating both math and verbal skills). 
					It’s important to note that <em>none of these categories is better or 
					worse than the others</em>—but understanding what subjects you’re 
					dominant in is key to helping you personalize your study plan.
				</p>

					Ask yourself the following questions:
				</p>

				<ol class="alphaList">
					<li>
						Would you rather take a test or write a paper?
					</li>

					<li>
						Would you rather read a book or do math problems for homework?
					</li>

					<li>
						What were your SAT scores? ACT scores?
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p class="indent">
					Your answers to questions A and B reveal what types of 
					classes you like. If you don’t like the subject material, you 
					probably won’t enjoy learning it and most likely will not do 
					well. If you answered that you’d rather write a paper and you 
					prefer reading, you’re probably a <em>verbally oriented student</em> and 
					would be more comfortable in qualitative classes such as history, 
					writing, political science, or literature (to name a few). If you 
					prefer taking tests and doing math problems, you’re probably a 
					<em>math oriented student</em> and would be most comfortable in math, 
					engineering, and science classes. If one of your answers to questions A and B indicate math dominance and the other indicates 
					verbal dominance, you may be a balanced student—a business 
					strategy class or microeconomics might appeal to you—or you 
					can use your answer to question C, your standardized test 
					scores, to determine your dominance. Remember, no answer 
					is the “right” answer, this takes some interpretation.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					I think standardized tests are a lousy measure of student 
					intelligence. However, I do believe they’re an excellent measurement of a student’s skills dominance. Does your math percentile 
					differ from either of your verbal scores (reading or writing) by 
					10 percentile points or more? If so, the higher of the scores 
					indicates dominance. For example, Eric scored in the 80th percentile in reading, the 90th percentile in writing, and the 67th 
					percentile in math. Eric is a verbally dominant student because 
					at least one of his verbal scores is greater than 10 percentile 
					points higher than math (80 – 67 = 13). While this equation is 
					by no means definitive, your answers to questions A through C

					of students:

				<ul>
					<li>
						Math dominant 
					</li>

					<li>
						Verbally dominant 
					</li>

					<li>
						Balanced
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="indent">
					<strong>2. Determine the skills dominance of your classes.</strong> Study 
					hours need to be determined per class per person. Therefore, 
					before registration, read the class description and determine if 
					the class is math dominant, verbally dominant, or balanced in 
					both skills. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					<strong>3. Review students’ average study hours per class.</strong> Many 
					schools have a course critique system. As part of this system, 
					students are often asked how much time they spent studying 
					outside of class time. The results are averaged, but by looking 
					up each class you’ll be taking, you’ll get a rough idea of the time 
					commitment necessary to meet your course goals. Hopefully, 
					your school has this database available. If not, try asking for it.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Warning: Faculty course critiques are valuable but should 
					be taken with a degree of caution. Students often have a bias 
					toward/against instructors. For example, “Easy A” professors 
					often get great reviews. On the contrary, very challenging yet 
					great professors often receive poor ratings. For our purposes, 
					checking to assess the study-time commitment per class is a 
					worthwhile exercise and I have found this data point alone to 
					be very valuable. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					<strong>4. Adjust the study hours rule of thumb.</strong> At this point 
					you’ve collected valuable information on yourself, your class, 
					and previous students. Now you’ll want to adjust the rule of 
					thumb in order to create a more reasonable study plan. Keep 
					in mind that moving the rule of thumb right or left even a little 
					bit really accumulates over the course of a week.

					calendars I see students still using and the number of study

				<h3>
					Electronic calendars
				</h3>

				<p>
					Strategic students use software and/or Web-based calendars for 
					three main reasons. First, you can centralize your events with 
					your laptop, mobile device, or tablet, and update your events 
					in one place but be able to reference them anywhere. Microsoft 
					Outlook for PCs and iCal for Macs both work well. Google 
					Calendar is the most popular and easiest to use Web-based 
					calendar I have found. There are many offerings out there, and 
					I don’t think which one you use matters too much. The key is 
					to be centralized and accessible via all of your devices. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Second, a Web-based calendar makes scheduling and tracking study hours
					a breeze. Study hours don’t always go exactly 
					accordingly to schedule; they don’t have to. The key is that 
					when you track your hours in a dynamic environment, a digital 
					calendar makes it easy to move events or expand and contract 
					hours.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Third, any software calendar allows you to swap views between day, week,
					and month. This is essential because it allows you to zoom out for the big picture and zoom in for your 
					day-to-day tactics. Strategic students all share the quality of 
					understanding the big picture while simultaneously executing 
					daily tasks.

						These students were caught completely unprepared 
						when a busy week came, or worse, two assignments 
						were due on the same day. I remember sitting in my

				<h3>
					Tracking Your Study Hours Progress
				</h3>

				<p>
					Now that you’ve learned how to estimate your study hours 
					and use a calendar as a strategic tool, it’s time to learn the 
					tremendous value that comes from tracking your study hours. 
					In flight school I learned that there are two parts to navigation: 
					plotting your course and tracking your progress. Tracking your 
					progress is the only way to predict if you’ll reach your destination or goal. (How do you know if you’ll reach your destination 
					if you don’t know where you are?) Furthermore, it’s the only 
					way to know if you’re off course, which is also mission critical 
					information. Remember, grades are not effective for tracking 
					progress. Grades are a result of how you spent your time; they 
					come TOO LATE to use for time management. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					The very best part of logging hours is the motivation is 
					provides. Tracking is the PROCRASTINATION BUSTER. Many 
					students (myself included) found that logging hours became 
					motivating because of how fast those pockets of study time 
					added up. When you take advantage of little pockets of time 
					throughout the day and then get home at night to find out that 
					these pockets added up to a balanced 4 hours or so of studying, 
					you’ll be motivated by the joy that comes with stress-free down 
					time. At the end of the day you won’t even feel like you did 
					that much. This is a great feeling. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Tracking makes college seem easier than it is because your 
					capacity for learning is maximized. Compare that great feeling 
					to the sinking feeling of getting home and knowing that you 
					have to study for what may be 4 to 6 hours. Now try doing that 
					studying while everyone else is watching movies and that guy 
					or girl you like wants to grab coffee. When students make this 
					transition, they literally take off. It’s joyous to watch.

					victory. Craig (like all professional athletes) tracks every training 
					session every day. Craig measures how far and fast he swam, 
					ran, or biked that day. He also logs his intervals and his times. 
					Most likely he has software (and a coach) helping him to analyze his progress so that he can make strategic decisions before 
					the day of the triathlon. Craig wants to understand his progress 
					as soon as possible to be in peak condition on race day. He 
					does NOT want to find out on the big day that he didn’t swim 
					enough to succeed. Race day, or even a few days before race 
					day, is TOO LATE to do anything about a weakness. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					The strategic student needs to think the same way. Test day 
					or project due dates are your race day. It’s NOT the time to 
					find out you didn’t put enough work into certain areas of your 
					studies. You won’t have to track to the level of detail that an 
					athlete does, but if you want to succeed in college you have to 
					track the hours you spend on each subject. Just enough detail 
					to maintain balance, and it only takes a minute or so per day. 
					Tracking not only helps you stay balanced, it prevents procrastination. Nothing says you’ve been ignoring a class like a big 
					goose egg on your study log next to that subject matter.
					There’s no set format for tracking your study hours, whether 
					you do this on a piece of scrap paper or use a spreadsheet. 
					Both methods have benefits and limitations. Whatever works 
					for you is fine. Just use whatever method is EASIEST. Logging 
					study hours should take around two seconds at the end of each 
					study session.

					The limitation of using scrap paper is that it’s work intensive

					it’s helpful to know how that affects the rest of the month or

					Using Your Professor’s Time Allocation as a Study Guide

				<p>
					You have learned how to estimate, track, and balance the study 
					hours of your whole schedule, but what about within a single 
					class? How do you determine how much time to spend on each 
					class topic? The simple answer lies with your professor. Your 
					professor will communicate the importance of each topic via

				<p class="indent">
					Let’s look at an example to highlight how to mirror your 
					professor’s time. Katie is taking Economics 101 and this week 
					she has her first test, which covers chapters 1 through 4. Katie 
					has already done of all her readings and homework. On Sunday 
					and Monday she has 4 hours of studying scheduled for economics. How much time should she spend studying each chapter? 
					Ninety-nine percent of my students answered this question, 
					“One hour per chapter” (4 hours ÷ 4 chapters = 1 hour per 
					chapter). The answer makes sense, right? Not necessarily. This 
					logic assumes that all the chapters are equally important (see 
					Figure 4.6). Why would you assume that? If the professor communicates that all the chapters are equally important, that’s one 
					thing. But you’re a strategic student, so you’re not going assume.

					and 2 hours on chapter 4 (50 percent). In other words, I’d 
					mirror the professor. Don’t equally distribute your study time

				<ol>
					<li>
						Estimate (your goal for study hours per class).
