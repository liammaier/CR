					Ignore the Pre-Test Chatter
				</h3>

				<p>
					I usually recommend that students arrive in class a few minutes 
					early to get settled and be ready to go when the professor 
					begins. The only day I do NOT recommend getting to class 
					early is on test day. Test day is the day when many of your 
					classmates will get to class early to “review.” There is actually 
					very little reviewing going on in the classroom right before a

					test. For the most part, there’s only chatter and a whole lot of 
					exaggerating going on. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					When I was a professor and gave tests in my class, I noticed 
					there were two usual suspects that emerged prior to every test. 
					One is a student who tells classmates how LITTLE he studied 
					and the second is a student who tells classmates how MUCH he 
					studied. These two students always talk louder than everyone 
					else and ultimately make their fellow classmates very nervous. 
					When I returned to school as a freshman, I’d go to class early 
					on test day and quietly observe the various interactions around 
					me. Guess what I saw? You guessed it, the same two suspects. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					As a professor, I studied the results of the two suspects in 
					hope of relaxing my future students. If I heard a student say 
					to classmates on test day anything resembling “I didn’t study 
					much,” I separated their tests after they handed them in. Grades 
					of those tests were both low scoring and high scoring—high 
					scoring to the point that it was clear these individuals studied 
					a great deal. Maybe these high-scoring students believed they 
					could never study enough. Or perhaps some were even lying 
					when they announced, “I didn’t study much.” I don’t know. 
					Either way, there’s nothing gained by listening to these students. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					The second type of student that could make others nervous 
					would say something along the lines of, “I studied 10 hours 
					yesterday for the exam!” Since you’re familiar with my time 
					management theories, you know that this marathon approach 
					to studying is terrible. Not only do I not believe this student, 
					but if she did in fact study for 10 hours, her study session was 
					ineffective and most of the time was wasted. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Do you see why I don’t want you to be around such negativity before the test? No good can possibly come from it. Get to 
					class a minute or two early, find your seat, and relax. Take a 
					moment to breathe and don’t look at any notes. Don’t let these 
					students distract you, destroy your confidence, or lessen your

				<h3>
					Start with Your Strongest Section
				</h3>

				<p>
					I’ve watched many students take many tests and for some reason most insist on starting with question #1. We are often taught 
					to start at the beginning, but this is not necessarily the best 
					way to take a test. Before starting to answer questions, scan 
					the test first, and then start the test at the section in which you 
					are strongest.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Starting the test where you choose has many benefits. First 
					of all, momentum is powerful in test taking. A great start sets 
					you up for a great finish. You build momentum and you build 
					confidence. The positive effect of momentum cannot be understated in test taking. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					The second benefit is related to timing. Your strongest section 
					is also probably the section you’ll move fastest in. By starting with your strongest section, you’re likely to get ahead in 
					your timing a little bit. This has a relaxing effect during a test, 
					which will enhance your effectiveness on the remaining portions. Getting ahead creates more time for the sections you may 
					find more challenging.
				</p>

				<div class="greyBox">

						Scan the test. Start with your strongest section.

				<h3>					
					Employ a Timing Strategy 
				</h3>

				<p>
					The most powerful tactic you can employ during test taking is a 
					timing strategy. Assuming you have taken the SAT or ACT, you 
					know that timing can make or break you. That will be true with 
					any test. However, your strategy during college tests will be far 
					simpler. In your test you’re seeking a strategy that keeps you 
					on track, eliminates wasted time, and does not create another 
					task. This is the goal of any time-management strategy.
				</p>

				</div>
	
				<p class="indent">
					Your professor may recommend that you “watch the clock” 
					during the test, though that’s not enough of a strategy. In fairness, it’s not the professor’s job to create a timing strategy for 
					you. A timing strategy should be customized, and the professor’s 
					job is to teach the class as a whole. A theme we’ve returned to 
					again in this book is that your college will deliver information 
					and you must subsequently customize it. That’s what a strategic 
					student does. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					There are two general categories of tests: (1) essay or short 
					answer tests and (2) problem-solving tests. For both categories, 
					the following general strategies work for most students.

			<section class="subsection" data-number="4" data-name="Essay or short answer tests ">

				<h3>
					Essay or short answer tests 
				</h3>

				<p>
					Prior to the test, you’ll know how many questions are on it, 
					assuming you’ve seen a practice test and/or the professor has 
					provided this information. Before test day, ask the professor 
					what length of answer she’s seeking. Now comes some elementary division: divide the test time by the number of questions 
					to give you your time allotment per question. <em>Do this the night 
					before, not during the test.</em> Wear a digital watch during the exam 
					and glance at it as you start every question, noting when you 
					“should” finish that question. Do the easy questions first and 
					you’ll get ahead.
				</p>

			</section> <!-- Section 4 -->

			<section class="subsection" data-number="5" data-name="Problem-solving tests ">

				<h3>
					Problem-solving tests 
				</h3>

				<p>
					Math and science classes tend to have more problems and differing sections. Timing each question is too much work during 
					a test. I’ve found that setting a time per page works well. Divide 
					the class time by the number of pages and mark your time at 
					the start and finish of each page. If you’re taking a computerbased test, determine how much time you want to spend on 
					a set of problems (for example check the clock every 5 or 10 
					problems). Remember you should still start with your strongest 
					section to gain momentum.

				<h3>
					Avoid Misreading a Question
				</h3>

				<p>
					You know about the value of timing yourself and moving 
					through a test at a consistent pace. It’s also important to resist answering a question instantly until you’ve asked yourself: 
					<em>“What concept(s) is this question testing?”</em>
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					The risk of not asking yourself this question is that you may 
					move forward with the wrong knowledge-set (for example the 
					wrong equation to use) and assumptions and answer the question incorrectly. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					High school exams often test you on facts—largely material 
					you memorized. In college you’re being tested on concepts 
					and how to apply them. By asking yourself “What concept(s) is 
					this question testing?” you’ll first identify what concepts you’re 
					being asked about; second, you’ll access what you’ve learned 
					about these concepts; and third, you’ll apply that knowledge to 
					the answer. Doing so takes only a second or two but pays off 
					by eliminating those questions that you’ll answer incorrectly 
					because you “misread” the question.
				</p>

			<section class="subsection" data-number="7" data-name="Give concise answers ">

				<h3>
					Give concise answers 
				</h3>

				<p>
					At some point in your college career, you’ll probably be given 
					a short answer or essay test. I’ve noticed a trend while grading 
					these tests—I call it “over-answering.” Many students think a 
					good technique for these types of tests is to write and keep 
					writing in the hopes that they stumble upon what they think 
					the professor is looking for. This is a misconception. Providing 
					the right answer and surrounding it with five wrong answers 
					is not a good strategy.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Over-answering is the conversational equivalent of rambling—
					nothing screams “I don’t know!” like rambling. In other words, 
					you’re communicating to the individual reading the exam that 
					you don’t have a clue. This is not the message to send to that 
					person with the red pen. Put yourself in the grader’s shoes.

				<p>
					What does that person want to hear? If you don’t know, guess, 
					but don’t ramble. You can also ask your professor prior to the 
					test what he or she believes is an ideal answer length. Your 
					professor has many tests to grade and is looking for accurate, 
					concise answers.

				<h3>
					Be Disciplined: Don’t Linger Over One Question
				</h3>

				<p>
					Test-taking requires focus and discipline. The focus part of the 
					equation makes sense to students, but often they’re confused 
					by test-taking discipline. It takes discipline to do the extras on 
					test day. For example, it takes discipline to incorporate timing 
					principles. Your professor will not require you to jot down times 
					and track your progress, but a disciplined student will do it 
					anyway and she will be rewarded by her high scores.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					I recommend to students that they skip questions they don’t 
					know immediately, move on, and come back later. The quicker 
					you move on, the better. Students sometimes resist this advice 
					because it may feel like quitting. If you’re reading this book, 
					you are a proactive person who likes finishing things you’ve 
					started. That’s a great quality to have, but it can work against 
					you while test taking. It takes discipline to quickly acknowledge 
					you don’t know something and move on. Grinding out an answer will consume too much time. Another benefit of moving 
					on is that there’s a great chance another problem or question 
					will jar loose the answer that wasn’t coming earlier. Sometimes 
					you may even find the answer somewhere else on the test.

					<h3>
						Early Finishers Don’t Do Better
					</h3>

					<p>
						When I first started giving tests in my class, I noticed 
						there were always a few students who completed tests 
						very early. These students acted smooth in their departure, with a confident walk to the door. I also noticed 
						that some other students’ eyes would open wide in 
						shock. On separate occasions a few students mentioned to me that they felt stressed when some of their 
						classmates left early while they still had so much more 
						to do. Their assumption was that these students really 
						knew their stuff. That assumption is usually false. 
					</p>

					<p class="indent">
						I completely understand why seeing a classmate depart a test early could cause stress, so I conducted a 
						little experiment. Over the course of a semester, every 
						time I gave a test or quiz, I marked the first three tests 
						handed in. Out of all the tests I gave that semester, not 
						one time did any of the first three finishers get an A. Not 
						once. My conclusion is that first finishers are not departing because they did so well; they’re departing because 
						they don’t have much more to give so they just leave. 
					</p>

					<p class="indent">
						By the way, the final finishers were never the top scorers either—you know the students who are hustling in 
						the last seconds while the professor begs them to hand 
						in the test. They don’t do well either. The A’s were usually 
						the students who thoughtfully moved through the test at 
						an appropriate pace and finished right on time. 
					</p>

					<p class="indent">
						I had this knowledge when I returned to school yet 
						still felt a small jolt of anxiety when that first test was 
						handed in with lots of time left on the clock. I then 
						quickly reminded myself of my experiment as a professor and moved on at an efficient pace. My experiment 
						should serve as nice reminder to you to RELAX when 
						that first test is handed in … it’s usually meaningless.

				<h3>
					Essay Questions: Start with an Outline
				</h3>

				<p>
					The tests I gave in my class were comprised of all essay questions. One of my very best students, Evan, used to bring a blank 
					piece of paper by his side and make notes on it throughout the 
					test. I asked Evan to see his notes and I found that he was making very short outlines (3-5 bullet points) for his test answers. 
					On subsequent tests, I watched the other students; the vast 
					majority of them would just start writing answers without first 
					jotting down any notes. I suggested to the class that an outline 
					would help to streamline thoughts, save time, and eliminate 
					rambling. Many took my recommendation and guess what happened? The class average of my test grades rose significantly. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Another benefit to outlining can come in the form of partial 
					credit. If you are rushing to finish a test and don’t have time to 
					write your fully developed essay, jot down your outline and get 
					partial credit. I gave a student almost full credit to a question 
					when she jotted down an outline at the end of the test because 
					I could tell she knew the answer and just ran out of time. By 
					the way, I also pulled her aside and coached her on employing 
					a timing strategy; she never had to throw down an outline again. 
					Combining a timing strategy with outlining on an essay test is 
					a recipe for success.

					Always show your work through each step of a test problem. 
					Many times professors want to understand your approach to 
					answering the question and will give you partial credit if you 
					understand the general steps to get to a solution but still calculate the wrong answer. The process is worth more than the 
					final answer.

				<p class="indent">

					correct, if you made a math error you may not get any credit. 
					However, if you show your work you may get most of the credit 
					even if you made a math error somewhere along the process. 
					Showing your work also helps you organize your problem solving
					method similar to an outline for an essay. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Make sure that you make it clear which equations you are 
					using to solve the problem before inputting any actual numbers. 
					One student I interviewed, Mark, reported, “I always made 
					sure to define each variable explicitly (x=10, y=15, etc.) so that 
					it was easy for the professor to understand which equations I 
					was using to solve the problem.” This is a much better approach 
					than just writing numbers down on a page with no context of 
					the actual equations. Mark was putting himself in the shoes 
					of his professor am I am sure the professor appreciated it. By 
					the way, Mark was an A-student in the school of engineering.
