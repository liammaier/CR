				<span class="firstLetter">W</span>ith so much of college academics being self-managed, it’s 
				crucial that students plan study time with their entire 
				portfolio of classes in mind. Specifically, students must retrain 
				themselves to think about how planning affects their semester 
				GPA first and foremost. Individual class grades are a secondary concern. Veterans must realize that they are no longer part 
				of a platoon, company, squadron, or unit. Your pursuit is no 
				longer team-oriented (although you will likely have some team 
				assignments); your class schedule and GPA are yours and yours 
				alone. The feeling of isolation in academics is one of the most 
				difficult obstacles I see veterans face. We come from place 
				where team is valued above individual and most veterans miss 
				that team-centric feeling. However the quicker you understand 
				your new environment, the less likely this feeling of isolation 
				will anchor you. College can be a selfish environment but that 
				isolated sentiment goes away the more your engage your support network and quite frankly, the more you succeed.

				be leaning toward their weaknesses. You may be thinking; 
				“but individual class grades are incorporated into GPA, right?” 
				True, but this is only part of the story, and this is where college 
				grading differs from high school grading.

			<p class="indent">
				Most colleges grade on a 4.0 scale. Your semester GPA is a 
				<em>weighted average.</em> For those that need a little algebra refresher, 
				a weighted average means that each class doesn’t contribute 
				equally to your GPA. Each class is “weighted” by the number of 
				credit hours. Table 3.1 shows how letter grades are correlated 
				to GPA.

				Two factors should help you shift your mindset from thinking 
				in terms of class grades to focusing on semester GPA: 
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<em>Credit hours:</em> All classes don’t have the same credit hours. 
					Some do, but not all. Therefore, classes with more credits are 
					going to have a much greater impact than those with less. For 
					example, a class with a lab is worth more credit than a class 
					that’s just classroom time.
				</li>
			</ul>

			</div>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<em>GPA scale:</em> Percentage grades or letter grades matter much less 
					in college than in high school. In college, a 100 percent in a 
					class or a 94 percent are no different—each results in a student 
					getting a 4.0 GPA. Likewise, an 83 percent or an 86 percent 
					each gets a student a GPA of 3.0. In high school it’s highly likely that your class rank was your competitive focus. Therefore, 
					a few percentage points in a class could mean a great deal 
					in terms of your rank. I don’t know of any colleges that have 
					class rank. In college your focus is GPA. If two students apply 
					to medical school and both have a 4.0, no one will know who 
					had the 96 percent and who had the 100 percent.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Therefore, in managing your GPA, you want to think of your 
				entire schedule of classes as a whole instead of looking at your 
				classes individually.

				<h3>
					Tracking Your GPA Like a Triathlete 
				</h3>

				<p>
					I love sports and I love metaphors. As a teacher it always 
					seemed easier for me to explain a subject by talking about a 
					completely separate one. Sports provide an applicable metaphor 
					for teamwork, determination, skill, and work ethic. I also like 
					that sports have measurable results. Everything is quantified in 
					sports, just like in academics. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Students seem to connect with the metaphors even if they’re 
					not athletes (you don’t need to be). When I teach students about 
					GPA management, my metaphor of choice is the triathlete. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					A triathlon consists of a sequential swim, bike, and run event. 
					The fastest racer across the finish line wins. Simple enough, 
					right? Actually there’s a lot more strategy than that. Triathletes 
					are endurance athletes, much like swimmers, marathoners, and 
					cyclists. The thing that makes triathletes unique is that they’re 
					not necessarily that great at any one event compared to athletes 
					who specialize in single events. If the gold medalist triathlete 
					were to compete against Lance Armstrong in cycling, he’d most
				</p>

<!-- Page 50 -->

				<div class="pagebreak">
					<p>

				<p>
					certainly lose. If he were to compete against Michael Phelps 
					in a swim, he’d lose again. If a triathlete is focusing on setting 
					a world record in the swim, I’d say she’s doing “too well” in 
					swimming and needs to shift focus to the other two events. 
					There’s no reason to “win” the swim and then struggle in the 
					bike and run segments and ultimately lose the race. Triathletes 
					are trying to be very good at three events, not record-setting 
					at a single event.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Even though triathletes are generalists, most still have an 
					event they are strongest and weakest in. If I had to choose one 
					event to be the best in, I’d choose cycling because it counts the 
					most. Cycling is about 50 percent of the race, the run is about 
					40 percent, and the swim is about 10 percent. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Just like the fact that a triathlete has a stronger event, he or 
					she will also have a weaker event, which will require more 
					training. The reason should be obvious—that event needs more 
					work. A triathlete will track training progress in each event 
					prior to the race to measure progress against goals (this is a 
					subject we’ll return to in Chapter 4). Tracking is essential in the 
					training of a triathlete. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					In the 2009 Ironman Triathlon Championship (Kona, Hawaii), 
					Craig Alexander won the entire race. He wasn’t a top three 
					finisher in either the swim or the bike portion. He didn’t need 
					to be because the individuals who dominated the swim and 
					bike segments didn’t do as well in their other two events and 
					Craig passed them all at some point. He never lost focus after 
					“losing” the swim and bike portions; he just kept pace and ran 
					his race. Craig wasn’t trying to be the world’s best swimmer, 
					cyclist, or runner. He was trying to be the world’s best triathlete 
					and he accomplished just that. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					How does this relate to academics? I want you to think like 
					a triathlete. I especially want you to think like Craig Alexander. 
					More specifically:
				</p>

				</div>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Be a generalist.</strong> It’s better to be very good in all your classes 
						than to be great in a few classes and weak in others. The triathlete is focused on
						one data point: finishing time. <em>You need to 
						focus on one data point: GPA.</em> No graduate school or future employer will ask
						you if you scored the highest grades in any single 
						class. They will ask what your GPA is. No one cares who won the 
						swim if that athlete isn’t on the podium at the end of the day. 
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Don’t compete in individual classes.</strong>	It’s easy to get caught 
						up in class competition. Craig never got caught up trying to 
						“win” the bike or swim portion of the triathlon. If he had, he 
						wouldn’t have had enough energy left in the run to win the 
						race. Remember, there’s no point getting the highest grade in 
						one class if your other classes are suffering. 
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Focus on higher credit-hour classes.</strong>	Just as the cycling 
						segment counts for “more” in a triathlon, higher credit-hour 
						classes count for more in your GPA. If your classes aren’t 
						equal in term of credit hours, focus on the class with the 
						higher number of credit hours. This will have a magnified 
						effect on your GPA (both positively and negatively). 
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Train more in more difficult classes.</strong> Like a triathlete who 
						isn’t equally proficient in all three events, you probably won’t 
						be equally proficient in all of your classes. A triathlete who’s 
						a weaker runner will run more in training than bike or swim. 
						Similarly, you’ll need to work more in a subject you’re weaker 
						in. The important point here is to know your strengths and 
						weaknesses. I’ll discuss how to determine that in Chapter 4. 
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="indent">
					Thinking like a triathlete is way of reminding you what the 
					goal is: GPA, GPA, and GPA. You don’t have to be the best 
					student in any one class, nor should you be. Your finish line is 
					the aggregate of all of your classes. Think like Craig Alexander: 
					set your pace and then win the race. No one remembers who 
					won the swim leg.

					The first thing I said to Alex was, “You could have done much 
					better.” Alex’s face dropped, and he said, “But I got a 3.6!” I 
					responded, “Yes, I can see that.” I went on to explain that 
					with no additional time spent, he should have had a 3.80 GPA. 
					Here’s my reasoning: Alex’s two lowest grades (albeit very good 
					grades) were in high credit-hour classes (Calculus and Biology 
					were 4 and 5, respectively). Alex did too well in History and 
					Writing. That’s right, too well.

					Alex responded somewhat defeated. “I didn’t think there was

					the history class and the professor loves me.” He was so proud

					What a difference! If you’re competing for a spot in a competitive graduate school, a 3.8 GPA is significantly better than a 
					3.6. Alex felt even worse when I explained that if one looked 
					merely at percentage scores, he actually beat Ella. Alex’s semester percentage grade (weighted average) was 93 percent 
					and Ella’s was 92 percent. Yet her GPA was much higher! If 
					you looked at classes individually as a win or a loss, Alex got 
					the higher grade in two classes and Ella got the higher grade 
					in two classes (Table 3.4). 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Alex far surpassed Ella in Writing and History, while Ella beat 
					Alex in Calculus and Biology by one point each. Yet in the end,

					Alex then asked a really good question, “What if all our 
					classes were equal in credit hours? Should I think the same 
					way?” The answer is yes. If all of the classes were the same 
					credit hours, Ella still would have come out on top; the effect 
					would just not have been as magnified. If all the classes were 
					3 credit hours, Ella would have received a 3.84 and Alex would 
					have received a 3.67 (see Table 3.5). This is still a very big 
					difference for no additional work. With even credit hours, the

					Ella still wins.

				<p class="indent">
					I explained to Alex that if he approached his academics like 
					Ella and stopped worrying about getting the highest grade

					wouldn’t have to spend any more time studying. He’d simply 
					need to adjust his strategy with the semester GPA in mind and 
					NOT percentage grades.
