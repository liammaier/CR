				<h3>
					My Undergraduate Years and Flight School
				</h3>

				<p>
					Like many college students, I arrived at my college campus far 
					from home and didn’t have a clue as to what I was embarking 
					upon. When I arrived at Tulane University in New Orleans, I 
					faced many life transitions: leaving home, living independently, 
					developing a new social life, learning to do laundry, and of 
					course studying in a completely different academic environment.
					Academics became just one thing on a long list of life 
					changes that I was adjusting to. Veterans arriving on campus 
					have certainly adjusted to life away from home however the 
					military learning environment is significantly different than the 
					college learning environment.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Academically speaking, I did what I thought was enough. I 
					saw my advisor when I had to, and I studied mostly when I had 
					a test coming up or a project due. In other words, I approached 
					college like the average college student, and my results were 
					also quite average. I graduated college in four years with a 
					bachelor’s degree in political science and a 3.2 GPA, though 
					I really struggled with attaining academic focus—and I know 
					now that I underachieved. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Following college, I barely managed to get into the Navy’s 
					flight school in Pensacola, Florida. When I showed up at flight 
					school, I was quite intimidated by the academic achievements of 
					my new classmates. They were engineers, cum lauds, students 
					from the Naval Academy and prestigious Ivy League schools, 
					and some had already earned a master’s degree. I was a kid 
					who scraped by in college. I decided there was only one way 
					to succeed and compete with those I perceived to be more 
					intelligent: I had to study smarter and more efficiently than my 
					fellow classmates. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Flight school moved at a furious pace. You studied one 
					day and you performed what you learned with an instructor 
					the next. Every day was a test, and there was no back of the

					classroom to hide out in. It was a great educational experience 
					and lesson in consistency in learning. I couldn’t believe how 
					much material I could absorb with daily effort and consistent 
					study sessions. I focused a great deal on <em>how</em> to study and <em>how</em>
					to approach material. Consistency in education is a theme I 
					would later return to as an academic advisor and professor; it’s 
					also a major theme of this book.

				<h3>
					My Return to Academia as an Advisor
				</h3>

				<p>
					When I heard that the Navy had a program that assigns officers 
					to universities to teach and manage ROTC (Reserve Officers’ 
					Training Corps) programs, I actively sought placement. I interviewed
					at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and was lucky 
					to be hired as an assistant professor of naval science. My title, 
					often called adjunct professor, means the university invited me 
					to teach for three to four years based on my experiences as a 
					naval officer, but I was never on a traditional tenure track. Not 
					being a traditionally trained educator allowed me to view education
					with a perspective unlike that of a conventional educator 
					and thus produce unconventional strategies.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					In addition to managing programs and teaching a Naval 
					Strategy and History class, I was also given the title Freshman 
					Academic Advisor. My initial impression was that as an advisor 
					I would mainly remind students to study hard and tell them 
					to work on their time management skills. I couldn’t have been 
					more wrong; academic advising became the biggest challenge 
					of my job and a significant focus of my life. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					At the end of my first year of teaching and advising, I had two 
					semesters of grades and data to study. The polarization of my 
					students’ grades puzzled me. The levels of success varied greatly 
					and two groups dominated. I had a group of students with great 
					results and a group with lousy results, yet not that many in the 
					middle range (B students). Unfortunately, much like the national 
					trend, a portion of my students did not return to University of

					down my struggling students and I was determined to do better 
					by my next class. Figure 1.1 is a representation of my students’ 
					results at the end of freshman year. Two groups should jump 
					out at you. The two tallest peaks are the 1.9-2.2 GPA group and 
					the 3.3–3.6 GPA group. That means I had many great students 
					andmany struggling students. In fact, the group that captured 
					the class average of 2.80, which lies somewhere in the middle, 
					comprised only about 13 percent of all my students.

					I correlated my students’ pre-college performance with their college
					grades and found that traditional indicators of intelligence 
					(such as SAT scores) were not strongly correlated with collegiate 
					success or failure. In other words, if you were the smart kid in 
					high school, you wouldn’t be an automatic success in college. 
					Contrarily, if you struggled in high school, that wouldn’t mean 
					you couldn’t be wildly successful in college. I saw both of these

				<h4>
					Conclusions
				</h4>

				<p>
					There was one dominant common theme among my struggling students:
					they didn’t have a plan or system for managing 
					resources. By resources I mean time management, study plans, 
					and campus support resources. Now if my struggling students 
					were the ones who didn’t have a plan, the successful group 
					was quite the contrary. The successful students were efficient 
					managers of resources. They had a system and they tracked 
					their progress, though it’s important to note that not all of their 
					systems were the same. There is no “right” system. The point 
					is that each successful student had personalized some sort of 
					system that worked for them. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Another commonality among my successful students was that 
					they tracked progress by a variable other than grades—usually, 
					they used time. Semesters rarely go exactly according to plan, 
					but the big difference with successful students was that they 
					knew when they were off track and formed a new plan. The 
					struggling students weren’t aware they were off track until it 
					was too late.

					Designing a seminar to help freshmen succeed

					As result of the lessons learned, I began designing strategies 
					aimed at preventing academic problems rather than solving 
					them. These strategies would help my students succeed with

				<h3>
					Graduate Business School 
				</h3>

				<p>
					During my years as a professor and advisor at University of 
					Colorado, Boulder, I was also a graduate student. I went to 
					University of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business as an evening 
					student and earned a master’s degree in business administration. 
					A great entrepreneurship professor at Leeds, Frank Moyes, once 
					said to my business plan class, “A business mind views the world 
					as problems that need to be solved, and entrepreneurs are the 
					ones who seek solutions.” At the time, I was seeking a solution 
					to the problem I was seeing among my freshmen students, and 
					an entrepreneurial mindset helped me analyze the problem.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					A business mindset means that we view the world as constantly
					seeking balance. In business we balance risk and rewards. 
					We balance return on investments. We balance data-driven decisions
					with instinctive decisions. Ultimately we balance cost 
					and benefits and we even study “balance sheets” in accounting. 
					Business is all about balance and efficiency. Balance is a central
					theory in business education and a central theory in the 
					strategic student mindset. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					My successful students were efficient managers. They knew 
					how to balance their commitments, their workload and, most 
					importantly, their time. My less successful students were always 
					imbalanced, pure and simple. For example, one common trend I 
					saw among low-GPA students is that they often had a high grade 
					in one class. They would even say to me, “But I got an A in (fill 
					in a class name).” My response would be, “That’s great, but your

				<p>
					The problem thus far with my academic theories was that I 
					had data from only one group. While I collected many strategies
					from my freshmen students, I didn’t have proof that their 
					success or lack thereof was a direct result of these strategies. 
					I believed it was, but a good academic always seeks proof. 
					Furthermore, I never had a student who implemented allof the 
					strategies simultaneously. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Although I learned a great deal about success from my freshmen
					students, I felt I couldn’t truly develop the strategic student 
					concepts unless I lived them. So I made the decision to return

					University of Colorado, Boulder and Front Range Community 
					College. I would experiment on myself.

				<h3>
					The experiment: comparing me versus me
				</h3>

				<p>
					My goal, in the broadest sense was to assess my ability to learn, 
					study, and take tests after implementing lessons I learned from 
					students during my career as an advisor. I would then compare 
					my results with my results as an eighteen-year-old freshman at 
					Tulane. Because this experiment was not totally scientific, its 
					inherent design is open to valid criticism. Let me address what 
					I think might be the main criticisms. 
				</p>

				<p class="criticism">
					<strong>Criticism:</strong> <em>“You can’t compare results because you learned much
					of the material your first time in the class.”</em>
				</p>

				<p class="criticism">
					<strong>Response:</strong> I chose classes that I took my freshman and sophomore years
					over fourteen years prior. I also chose subjects that I 
					haven’t studied since then (I could never remember material for 
					that long anyway). I also took a few classes that I didn’t previously take to simply practice “learning.” Learning new material 
					is like painting with a clean palette. I was able to focus on learning and studying but without comparing results.
				</p>

				<p class="criticism">
					<strong>Criticism:</strong> <em>“Class difficulty differs from school to school.”</em>
				</p>

				<p class="criticism">
					<strong>Response:</strong> True, to some extent, but there are some subjects 
					where this is minimized. I chose math and science classes only. 
					My reasoning for this is that 100-level science classes are stan-

					dardized. This means that to be an accredited collegiate science 
					class, every school has to teach the same material. In other 
					words, Chemistry 101 at Harvard teaches the exact same material as
					Chemistry 101 at a two-year community college in California or at Clemson University in South Carolina and elsewhere. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					It’s also important to note the time lapse between when I 
					first studied this material and the present has not affected the 
					material. Basic chemistry, physics, statistics, and biology have 
					not changed appreciably nor will they. More subjective classes 
					like writing or political science would be too difficult to compare
					because material and grading criteria varies from school to 
					school. 
				</p>

				<p class="criticism">
					<strong>Criticism:</strong> <em>“Your lifestyle has changed; how can you compare the 
					two results?”</em>
				</p>

				<p class="criticism">
					<strong>Response:</strong> I agree that my lifestyle has changed. When I was 
					eighteen and a freshman, I did not have a job or any financial 
					responsibilities. In fact, I had all the free time in the world. 
					When I returned to school at age thirty-two, I had a full-time job 
					(around fifty hours a week), a mortgage, bills, a wife, and a new 
					baby. I couldn’t agree more, my lifestyle is certainly different 
					… I was even more disadvantaged in terms of time during my

					<strong>Criticism:</strong> <em>“You took some classes at community college—those 
					classes are easier.”</em>

				<p class="criticism">
					<strong>Assumption:</strong> I did take some classes at a community, or juniorcollege
					because I needed to take evening science classes and my 
					local university didn’t offer evening sessions. The quality of

				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					I do believe the spectrum of student aptitude is wider at a 
					community college. This ranges from brilliant students seeking a 
					cheaper alternative to starting college to high school “screw-ups.” 
					Therefore, I did not want to be graded relative to my classmates 
					and I took no classes that were graded on a curve (relative to 
					my classmates). I wanted to be graded on how well I learned 
					the material and nothing else. Therefore, my grades only reflect 
					how I did in terms of learning the material, NOT how I did relative to my classmates. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Further, the only classes I took at the community college were 
					those accepted as credit in the University of Colorado system. 
					Therefore, they met all university criteria in terms of material 
					covered. I even took state exams when available. For example, 
					in my Chemistry 101 class I took the American Chemical Society 
					exam, which is the national standard for all university chemistry 
					classes. I did quite well, in fact.

					The results of my “experiment” are more qualitative and, frankly,

					I absorbed more material, more efficiently, and I scored higher 
					grades. My class time was more productive. I never studied 
					more than two hours at a stretch. I never studied late into the 
					night. Keep in mind too that I took these classes at the very 
					busiest time in my life. I was working full-time and had a new
