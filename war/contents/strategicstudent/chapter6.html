				for the majority of your collegiate learning and yet your school

				will teach those skills. In high school and military classrooms, 
				the “quick students” may have scored the best grades. But in 
				college, the best studiers and time managers are more likely to 
				succeed. Time management, classroom skills, and study skills 
				are the three core areas of expertise you’ll need in college to 
				achieve your academic goals. This chapter is dedicated to the 
				study skills I have found to be most powerful. Decide which 
				skills work for you and which don’t. Just remember to keep

					colors, or furniture. The foundation and framework need to be 
					in place before the other details are added. Effective studiers 
					follow a similar approach: key points, or big ideas, are your 
					framework, and the details get fi lled in later. A common mistake 
					that college freshmen make is to drudge through details page 
					by page, learning every item prior to moving forward. You 
					simply don’t have enough time for this type of approach, nor 
					is it effective.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Outlines are your blueprints, and they can be found everywhere. They’re in your textbooks at the beginning and/or end 
					of each chapter. In fact, the structure of a chapter itself is like 
					an outline—look for section headings as indicators of important 
					concepts. Even your professors communicate using outlines via 
					their syllabuses slides, and lectures. Class time is the ultimate 
					outline; limited class time means the professor will discuss key 
					points. Learn these key points first and details subsequently 
					(see Figure 6.1). Remember, build the house first and decorate 
					it last.

				<p clas="indent">
					While studying, think about how long the test will be. Is the 
					test an hour? Two hours? Twenty minutes? How much information could possibly fit into that time frame? (Tests won’t cover 
					everything in the assigned readings.) If you were the professor, 
					what would you choose to fit into this time frame? Most professors aren’t random in their testing, so with a little thought you 
					can (and should) predict what will be on the test. Try and think 
					like your professor.

					History classes serve as perfect examples for blueprint studying. Let’s say you’re studying the Civil War. The big ideas to 
					study would be: Who was involved in the war? Why were they

					study would be: What were the major battles during this war? 
					Who won these battles? What were the effects of each battle?

						didn’t see any highlighting. Highlighting implies you’re 
						going to go back and reread a chapter (students rarely 
						go back and review just the highlighted areas of the 
						book). That’s not efficient studying. When you return 
						to studying, you should be reviewing notes, practicing

				<h3>
					Find Out Who Writes the Exams
				</h3>

				<p>
					On the first day of class, the professor goes over the syllabus 
					and often mentions who writes the class’s exams. If the professor doesn’t tell you who writes the exams and it’s not mentioned 
					in the syllabus, I believe the most important question you can 
					ask in any college class is: “Who writes the exams?” The answer 
					to this question tells you what types of study strategies you’ll 
					need.
				<p>

				<br />

				<p class="indent">
					The most common answers fall into three categories:
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					1. The professor writes the exams.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					2. The textbook company generates the exams.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					3. The department writes the exams.

				<p class="indent">
					In the military, an intelligence team will study the enemy in 
					depth prior to war. They will look at geography, capabilities, 
					strengths, weaknesses, and prior engagements that our enemy 
					has been part of. The role of military intelligence is to provide 
					the military forces with actionable information so that we can 
					prepare an appropriate strategy and train efficiently. Knowing 
					who writes your exams provides you with the exact same value. 
					Understand the challenges ahead and you can face them more 
					efficiently. Your professor is certainly not your enemy; but the 
					test is and you are planning to defeat it right? Your study plan’s 
					effectiveness determines your grades. Grades determine your

					competitiveness for graduate school, a job, and so on. That GPA 
					has a nasty way of following you around for a very long time.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Each of the different types of exams has advantages and 
					disadvantages. I do not believe any exam means working more 
					or less, just differently. In the following sections, we’ll look at 
					how preparation strategies change depending on who writes 
					the exams. <em>The main difference between strategizing for each 
					of the three exam types is deciding what your primary study 
					sources are.</em> You’ll be saturated with information via textbooks, 
					notes, study guides, solution manuals, the Internet, and more, 
					and you can’t study it all. Your time is limited, so knowing what 
					sources to focus on is crucial.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Study strategies help you manage your limited time, improve 
					your test-taking skills, relieve stress, and ultimately land you 
					a better grade. There is no substitute for learning the material, 
					but study strategies will help you focus your learning with laser 
					precision for test-taking effectiveness. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					As you’ve heard me say before, success in college academics is mostly what you do outside of the classroom. Yet I’ve 
					been unable to find any class syllabus that offers a study plan. 
					Ultimately, creating a study plan is the student’s job. That said, 
					I’ve never heard of any professor who was unwilling to answer 
					the question, “Who writes the exams?” In fact, a few of my 
					students who asked this question said their professors were so 
					impressed that they were thinking this strategically—and on 
					day one of the semester!

					have ample time to help you succeed. One-on-one time with a 
					professor will be limited no matter how small your school is. 
					The professor’s job is to teach the class as a whole. It’s your job 
					to own your academic success. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					When professors write their own exams, they teach with 
					the particular exam in mind. By being good educators, they’ll 
					tell you in class what’s most important to learn. The types of 
					questions they ask in class are the types of question that will 
					appear on the exam. The subject matter they focus on in class 
					will be the subject matter that the exam focuses on. Professors 
					may not tell you explicitly what’s on the exam (some professors will), but if you know they’re the exam writer and you’re 
					constantly thinking along these lines, you won’t be shocked 
					when the exam lands in front of you. The best part about 
					professor-written exams is there are few surprises. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					With professor-written exams, missing a class, even for a valid 
					reason, really hurts. Every class will communicate a theme and 
					focus that may not be mirrored by the textbook. The wisdom is 
					not just in the professor’s notes for the class (discussed in the 
					next section) it’s in hearing the professor speak and listening 
					carefully to what’s being emphasized. To be successful with this 
					format, you have to be a good note taker. Chapter 5 provided 
					tips on how to take effective notes. 
				</p>

				<h4>
					Study strategies for professor-written exams 
				</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Most professors who write exams use lecture notes or slides 
						as an outline. Ask the professor for their teaching notes or 
						slides (usually on PowerPoint). Many professors post their 
						notes via the school’s online portal. <em>This is their road map 
						for teaching and now it is your outline for studying.</em> These 
						notes will target the most important things you need to learn. 
						It’s admirable to try and learn every possible subject in your 
						textbook, but it won’t help you focus on the test material. If

				</div>
	
				<ul>
					<li class="hiddenBullet">
						the professor does not provide notes, your note-taking skills 
						just became even more critical.
					</li>

					<li>
						If the professor uses slides, do not study any material that 
						is not addressed on at least one slide until you’ve mastered 
						the material specifically presented. You certainly need to 
						dive deeper into the subjects mentioned on the slides via the 
						textbook, notes, research, and discussion, but don’t drift away 
						from the material listed on the slides. The goal here is to 
						prevent what I call “information chasing.” Information chasing 
						is similar to surfing the Internet and getting lost or distracted 
						(as when you get on the Web to research a book and an hour 
						has gone by and you’re watching a golden retriever dancing on YouTube and you don’t know how you got there). 
						There’s going to be so much information via the textbook and 
						Internet that you could spend many hours chasing questions 
						that arise in your studies. 
					</li>

					<li>
						Master first what you can expect on the test. I don’t like 
						saying it, but I’m recommending you contain your intellectual 
						curiosity—at least until after you’ve mastered the professor’s 
						plan. If your thirst for knowledge is still truly unquenched, 
						then I think you’ve found your passion and perhaps what 
						your PhD should be in! Don’t deviate from the professor’s 
						path; it’s like having the other team’s playbook. The likelihood of a test question outside of the notes is not impossible, 
						but there will be very few. 
					</li>

					<li>
						Each time the professor asks a question in class, create 
						an internal alert. An internal alert is anything that smacks 
						you in the head. I like to imagine a bell sound followed 
						by the phrase “TEST QUESTION—TEST QUESTION—TEST 
						QUESTION.” Do this silently for a week and you’ll start to see 
						a theme developing by the professor.

					Professor-written exams are the best because they are the 
					easiest to create a study plan for. Your professor is telling you

					the format of the test questions. You just need to know what

			<section class="subsection" data-number="6" data-name="Textbook exams ">

				<h3>
					Textbook exams 
				</h3>

				<p>
					Textbook exams (TEs) are often used in math and science 
					classes, where the information presented is nearly the same at 
					every school. <em>The primary study sources for TEs are the textbook 
					and supporting materials</em> from study guides (from the same 
					publisher as the book), online quizzes, tutorials, and so on.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					I don’t advocate missing classes, but if you must miss a class 
					where the exams will be textbook generated, it won’t kill you. 
					In-class note taking can be less detailed than in classes where 
					you’ll have professor or department-written exams. Because 
					the textbook company generates the exams, you have all the 
					information you need within their materials. Your primary focus 
					is the textbook and supporting materials, and you have access 
					to that anywhere, anytime!
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Although you have all the answers at your fingertips, there’s 
					generally a much broader spectrum of material to study than 
					when the professor writes the exams. There are often surprises 
					on TEs. It’s very possible to be tested on some detail the book 
					mentions that the professor did not.
				</p>

				<h4>
					Study strategies for textbook exams

				<ul>
					<li>
						While taking notes in class, don’t worry about writing down

					<li class="hiddenBullet">
						everything the professor states on a subject. Instead, just 
						make a note of the subject mentioned. Later on, return to 
						that subject and fill in notes based on what the textbook 
						says. Here’s an example: your biology professor lectures on 
						Darwin’s theory of natural selection. In class make a note 
						that your professor finds this subject important. Write in your 
						notes something like “Darwin/Natural Selection” and then listen intently to the professor. Fill in your notes under “Natural 
						Selection” later using the verbiage from the authors of the 
						book. The manner that a subject appears in the book is the 
						manner that it will appear on the test. In other words, the test 
						will reflect the author’s verbiage, not the professor’s. 
					</li>

					<li>
						Find the textbook’s additional resources (even if the class 
						doesn’t require you to). Study guides and the supporting 
						website are amazing. These resources often have notes and 
						practice quizzes/tests, which will have a similar tone and level 
						of difficulty that you’ll likely see on the test. Your professor 
						may not ever mention these resources and most students will 
						ignore them, but they are worth their weight in gold come 
						test time. 
					</li>

					<li>
						Be an active reader. I’m not going to recommend a specific 
						system of note taking; I will say you need a system. Different 
						methods work for different students. Just make sure that 
						you’re being consistent and noting the author’s questions that 
						she raises in the context of the book. 
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="indent">
					Textbook-generated exams can be tough because everything 
					in the assigned reading is fair game. Even that one little sentence mentioning a barely memorable fact may turn up on the 
					test. The good news is that you have your main study source at 
					all times. Remember to tune yourself into the textbook author’s 
					tone more so than your professor’s. That doesn’t mean you

					Department exams
				</h3>

				<p>
					A few departments on campus offer many sections of one class. 
					Math classes are a good example. A typical college will generally offer many sections of Calculus 101 or Statistics 101 (to 
					name a few). Sometimes in an effort to standardize the syllabi, 
					the department will get together the respective professors and 
					they’ll write an exam as a team. Some departments do this for 
					every test and others do it just for the final exam. Either way, 
					you’ll need to adjust your study strategy. Knowing how to tailor 
					your study plan based on the type of test will make you a more 
					confident and prepared student and therefore more likely to 
					score high grades.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Department exams are usually written at the start of the 
					semester. Therefore, your professor is likely teaching with 
					the test in mind. This is good because the same strategies I 
					outlined with professor-written exams apply. Remember, for 
					professor-written exams, class notes and outlines are your primary sources of study.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Department exams are also probably the most challenging 
					because they require some extra legwork on your part, which

					similar to professor-written exams with one noteworthy exception: multiple professors are writing the exam. This means you’ll 
					likely see various styles and tones on the exam. The types of 
					exam questions may also differ from both the textbook and 
					your professor. Even in standardized courses, some professors 
					emphasize different subjects. If one professor writes a greater

				<p>
					questions on one subject than you feel was emphasized in your class.
				</p>

				<h4>
					Study strategies for departmental exams
				</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<em>The biggest difference in studying for department exams is 
						not the study source — it’s in your time allocation</em>. You have 
						to give equal study time to all subject matter even if your 
						professor did not. In other words, while all the professors 
						are teaching the same course, their time (and possibly excitement)
						per subject matter may differ. You must take an egalitarian approach to subject matter when studying. Let’s say you’re 
						taking Physics 101 and the department is writing your final 
						exam. One of the professors likes theoretical questions about 
						Newton’s laws. Another professor prefers math problems. You 
						need to practice both equally, whereas if Professor 1 was the 
						sole author of the exam, you’d focus much more on theoretical problems. 
					</li>

					<li>
						Find out who the other professors are and their office hours. 
						This information is generally available on the department’s 
						website. Make an appointment or drop by during office hours 
						and ask the professors what subjects and types of exam 
						problems they emphasize. Here’s one way you might frame 
						your question: “Professor Smith, my name is Dave and I’m in 
						another section of Chemistry 101. I’m currently preparing for 
						the next test and would like to ask what subject matter you 
						think I should emphasize while studying. Do you have a few 
						minutes?” Most professors will give you advice in the order 
						of importance, so write down the subjects in the order given. 
						These appointments should take only a few minutes per professor, but you’ll need to plan ahead. Gather the information 
						you need from the professors other than your own and you’ll 
						have yourself a clean and concise study guide. 
					</li>
				</ul>

					</p>
				</div>
	
				<ul>
					<li>
						Another strategy in preparing for department exams is to 
						create a study group with students in the other class sections. 
						This may be challenging because you may not know students 
						in the other classes. Here’s how one of my student’s did this: 
						Mark discussed the idea of an “inter-section” study group with 
						his biology professor. That professor not only communicated 
						the idea to the other classes, but she was nice enough to 
						facilitate a classroom one night a week for the group to meet. 
						It’s truly amazing how much professors and staff will help 
						if you simply ask for it. By the way, the professor was very 
						impressed with Mark’s proactive nature, so in one strategic 
						move Mark created a time-saving study group and impressed 
						his professor. Do you think that at the end of the semester if 
						Mark’s grade is on the fence, the professor will help him push 
						it over? If I were his professor, I would. 
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="indent">
					Your primary study sources are the same as professor-written 
					exams: teaching notes and class outlines. Your study time allocation is weighted equally for all the subjects expected to 
					appear on the exam. The only exception to that rule is if all 
					the professors tell you they emphasize the same material in the 
					same order. In that case, you can adjust to meet their priorities.

					One of the most effective forms of studying is the use of practice tests. Practice tests are either tests the professor gave a

					have. By “efficiently,” I mean that the goal is to maximize test 
					preparation in the least amount of time. A criticism I received 
					once from a student was, “It sounds like you’re advising me to

					You’re not rewarded for quantity of hours studying alone. You

					The Power and Pitfalls of Study Groups 
				</h3>

				<p>
					Study groups can be very beneficial for college students. One 
					insight from my research that surprised me, though, was how 
					sparingly my top students participated in study groups. When 
					I returned to school and joined a few study groups myself, I 
					learned why. Study groups are promoted by schools because 
					they work in theory but not so much in practice. Most groups 
					are terribly inefficient and top students know to avoid inefficiency. In fact, groups that aren’t well thought out or are poorly 
					ran can actually hurt students’ grades. If you’re thinking of 
					organizing a study group or joining one, the following tips will 
					help you both avoid some of the pitfalls and help you maximize 
					your involvement.

				<h3>
					Criteria for effective study groups
				</h3>

				<p>
					Study groups can be remarkably <em>effective</em> IF and only IF they 
					meet at least three of the following criteria:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						The group consists of like-minded students. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Members follow specific agendas and topics.
					</li>
					<li>
						The format includes teaching. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Members shouldn’t be your friends.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="indent">
					<strong>Like-minded students.</strong> When you’re in a group of likeminded students, you’re studying with students who move at 
					about the same pace and prefer the same format of studying. 
					Let’s start with pace. If one student is moving much faster or 
					slower than the whole group, it just doesn’t work. (Ever go jogging with someone who runs much faster or slower than you? 
					You usually end up separating, which was not the point.) As 
					for studying in a similar format, if one student wants to have a 
					discussion while another student wants to work problems on 
					a whiteboard and yet a third student prefers reviewing notes, 
					it doesn’t work because individual preferences are conflicting. 
					And if the group tries to do all three, you’re compromising 
					your time. The group must be united in pace and format to be 
					worthwhile.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					<strong>Specific agenda topics.</strong> Study groups are most effective 
					when they cover specific topics within a class. For example, 
					meeting to study periodic table trends and solubility problems 
					for a chemistry class, rather than to discuss chemistry in general is more specific and thus more productive. To be efficient 
					at studying, you need to hit the areas that you need to hit. 
					Naturally, students in a group often differ on what topics they 
					individually need to study. So what happens when four students 
					meet and haven’t agreed on topics? They spend their precious 
					time compromising. Compromising means more study hours

				<p>
					for you. You don’t want that. Your goal is to work smarter, not harder. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					<strong>Includes teaching.</strong> The very best study groups involve 
					teaching, where each student teaches the others at some point. 
					Teaching helps everyone. One of the best ways to test if you 
					understand a concept is to try and articulate it to another person; therefore, the teacher is gaining benefit. An excellent way 
					to gain understanding of a topic you’re struggling with is to 
					hear it explained differently. Thus, hearing a topic explained 
					by your peers helps you learn. Everybody wins. Just make sure 
					there isn’t just one teacher emerging in the group—share the 
					duty and teach each other. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					<strong>Members shouldn’t be your friends.</strong> Friends are your worst 
					study partners. I’d prefer you study with your enemies—at least 
					then you might stick to a topic. I truly believe you’re kidding 
					yourself if you try and convince yourself that you can group 
					study with your friends. Would you rather study for 2 hours 
					alone and then socialize for 2 hours with your friends? Or study 
					for 4 hours with your friends, get very little done, and not really 
					be having fun either? It’s win-win or lose-lose depending on 
					your choice.

					<h3>
						Resist “Study Dates”
					</h3>

					<p>
						If you’re attracted to one of your classmates and you 
						plan a “study date,” it’s a date and NOT studying. Dating and studying are like pepperoni and ice cream. Both 
						are great but definitely not great together. Go on the 
						date and have fun but don’t count that time toward 
						your study hours. The goal of a date and the goal of a 
						study session work in opposition. Can you imagine saying to your friends, “That date went great! We finished 
						chapter 3 and I really understand calculus better”? You 
						get my drift.

				<h4>
					How to use study groups 
				</h4>

				<p>
					The reason why great students don’t study much in groups is 
					because it’s hard to meet the criteria mentioned above. Most 
					students create study groups with their friends or with whoever 
					happens to be sitting by them in class. They then meet and end 
					up discussing grades, the last test, the professor’s armpit stains, 
					and other such topics. Many groups also end up as a forum for 
					comments like: “I think this test is going to be sooo hard. I am 
					stressed. Are you stressed?” That road ends nowhere and now 
					you’re in a therapy group, not a study group. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					If you <em>can</em> meet the above criteria (at least three) then you 
					have something powerful and your meetings will benefit the 
					whole team. That said, <em>I recommend a rough split of 25 percent 
					group study to 75 percent solo study as a general rule.</em> Like any 
					rule of thumb, it can be adjusted to suit a particular type of 
					class. A class that relies heavily on debate and discussion can 
					benefit more from group study, whereas a math/science class 
					requires less discussion and more head-down-in-the-book type 
					of learning. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					My advice is to use study groups but use them lightly because 
					ultimately the majority of work always comes back to you; this 
					is what I mean by taking ownership of your GPA, time, and 
					education. Moreover, each member must contribute something 
					of equal or greater value or risk being seen as a freeloader. 
					Study groups are not a place to feel out one’s classmates for 
					their knowledge levels. Your mission is to partake in or lead 
					well-executed study groups, and run . . . no, sprint from the 
					others.
				</p>

				<div class="greyBox">
					<p>
						Don’t use study groups for more than 25 percent of your 
						studying time.

					<h3>
						Study Groups versus Collaborative Groups
					</h3>

					<p>
						A <strong>study group</strong> is a collection of students discussing, 
						processing, and learning material that each student 
						will be tested on individually. A <strong>collaborative group</strong>
						is a collective effort that will culminate in the delivery 
						of a single assignment by the whole team. Collaborative groups are great for exchanging ideas, debating, 
						or innovating. Examples of collaborative assignments 
						are group presentations, projects, or even a lab exercise. You can delegate responsibilities in a collaborative 
						group; you can’t delegate in a study group.
					</p>

					<p class="indent">
						Before meeting with your group, make sure you understand the group’s goals. If you don’t understand the 
						goals, assume a leadership role and assign a few objectives for reaching those goals. In a collaborative group, 
						if objectives aren’t clearly defined and nobody is driving, 
						it will turn into wasted time filled with chatting, arguing, 
						and little accomplishment. 
					</p>

					<p class="indent">
						You should leave a collaborative group meeting feeling that you made progress on an assignment. You 
						should leave a study group meeting feeling like you 
						better understand a particular set of material. Understanding the objectives of each group will help avoid 
						the common pitfalls of group work in college. <em>The key 
						to successful groups is not simply creating them but 
						effectively managing objectives.</em>

					Working with Tutors

				<p>
					I’m a big fan of tutors. Meeting with a tutor is like a study group

					we hired a math tutor because calculus was commonly a class

					students struggled with. I interviewed the tutor one day and 
					discovered two problems with the way students utilized this 
					great resource. First, when students make an appointment with 
					a tutor, they often don’t realize that the time with the tutor is 
					very limited. Consequently, they may feel cheated when the 
					tutor has to cut them off. Second, when students don’t bring 
					specific questions to the appointment, the tutor spends precious 
					time trying to discover the problem areas rather than solving 
					them.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					The solution is simple and similar to how you run an efficient 
					study group: be very specific when you meet. Don’t just say, 
					“I’m having trouble with these problems.” Say, “On problem 
					number 3, I understand how to get to this step but this is where 
					I get lost.” That way, you’ve pinpointed where you struggle and 
					now the tutor can spend the time helping you overcome your 
					problem area.

						guidelines, though, for chapters to read or a series of

				<h3>
					Four Great Study Habits 
				</h3>

				<p>			
					After a few years of advising, I began to hear about recurring, 
					positive study habits from my very successful students. After I 
					heard a method more than once, I started to share it with other 
					students. When I returned to school myself, I tested out these 
					strategies. This section discusses four of the easiest yet most 
					powerful study habits to help you maximize your academic 
					prowess.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<strong>1. Avoid the “danger zone”</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					In terms of college social life, not much happens during the 
					day. At night, you’re literally surrounded by your classmates 
					and friends. This environment creates what I call the “danger 
					zone,” the hours between 9 p.m. and midnight. This time is a 
					trap for college students because no matter where you go, it 
				</p>

<!-- Page 138 -->

				<div class="pagebreak">

				<p>
					seems like people are hanging out. How could any 18-year-old 
					be expected to withstand the lure of socializing with these 
					new and exciting people? I don’t even try to advocate resisting. 
					Instead, I encourage planning as little of your studying as possible during the danger zone hours. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					There will certainly be times when you need to resort to the 
					danger zone for studying, but when you’re building your study 
					plan, schedule as little as possible during this time because you 
					won’t get much done during those hours anyway. Schedule as 
					many daytime hours as possible, and then you can enjoy your 
					evenings to the fullest with your friends (guilt free).
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Studying during the day has the added benefit of greater 
					retention. You’ll undoubtedly be tired during the danger zone, 
					so even if you study for multiple hours, those hours will not be 
					as effective as when you’re rested and alert. 
				</p>

				<div class="indentedSection top bottom">
					<h3>
						Study Where They’re NOT
					</h3>

					<p>
						One evening I drove by the engineering building and I 
						saw a student of mine (Frank) walking out and I thought 
						it was kind of odd. The reason I thought it was odd was 
						because Frank was a finance major. I asked Frank the 
						next day why was he was in the engineering building 
						when he goes to the business school. He answered, 
						“That is precisely why.” Frank was studying where his 
						buddies were not and where he would not be interrupted. I thought this habit exhibited simple brilliance 
						because it was past 9 p.m. and Frank knew he was in 
						the danger zone.
					</p>
				</div>

				<br />

				<p>
					<strong>2. Study in intervals</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					Strategic students study in intervals. Intervals are any amount of 
					time between 15 minutes and 2 hours. Another way of putting 
					this is to say that <em>you don’t need to endure long study sessions. </em>
				</p>

<!-- Page 139 -->

				<div class="pagebreak">
					<p>
						Chapter 6 • <span class="chName">Study Skills</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="pageNumber">
							139
						</span>
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					Shorter intervals that add up are the key to studying, and they 
					produce outstanding benefits.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Picture yourself walking into a study room knowing you 
					have 4 hours of studying to do. The idea of a long study session 
					ahead of you already makes you feel defeated and depressed. 
					This is a bad mindset for learning. Now picture yourself walking into a study room and you only have 1 hour of studying to 
					knock out. You’re focused and positive. One hour is no big deal, 
					and it will be easy to focus for that amount of time. This is the 
					positive mindset that results from interval studying.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Ships are built into compartments so that if one section of the 
					ship is damaged, the flooding can be sealed off and the ship is 
					still operational. When you schedule intervals of studying, it’s 
					like building compartments. If one compartment is damaged, 
					it will be isolated and won’t infect the rest of the plan. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Let’s say you’re planning a short, 1-hour study session between classes. As you’re walking by a quad, you see your 
					friends playing dodge ball. They’ve already spotted you, how 
					can you resist? You can’t, so you join them and don’t study. But 
					you’ve only lost an hour off your master study plan. Scheduling 
					intervals limits your loss. If you had put off studying and were 
					on your way to a needed 4-hour session, this dodge ball game 
					could grow and now your plan is significantly damaged, perhaps even beyond repair. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					In summary, never plan for long study sessions. Plan your intervals and track your progress. You’ll be surprised how quickly 
					they add up, how focused you’ll be, and how little damage is 
					done when something comes up (because it will).
				</p>

				<h4>
					The power of 15 minutes
				</h4>

				<p>
					Students often ask, “How long does an interval have to be 
					to be effective?” I’ve experimented with this and interviewed 
					students and have found that 15 minutes is a nice minimum. 
					Some students may think nothing can get done in 15 minutes
				</p>

				<p>
					so they’ll ignore these pockets of time. Average students think 
					an hour of studying is necessary to begin. Great students know 
					that four pockets of 15 minutes are actually more effective and 
					much less painful than a full hour. They really do add up!
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					While 15-minute intervals can be powerful, they’re not appropriate for the type of studying that involves problem solving 
					or group work. Those sessions take a few minutes just to open 
					up your notes and material, and you need longer to get into a 
					groove. 
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Fifteen minutes is useful for any studying that involves memorizing and reading. Most classes have at least some degree of 
					either. Keep a notecard, a mobile file, or even a single sheet 
					of notes handy. Anytime you have 15 minutes, pull out your 
					notes and do some reviewing. When you settle in to study that 
					material later, the tedious memorizing work is done. 
				</p>

					<h3>
						Mike’s Use of 15 Minutes
					</h3>

					<p>
						I had a student, Mike who swore by this technique in 
						foreign language classes. He said he never sat down 
						and studied for Spanish. Instead, Mike crammed some 
						notes daily in his bag and reviewed them whenever he 
						had a pocket of time. Mike got all A’s in Spanish and 
						went on to study international business. 
					</p>
				</div>

				<p class="indent">
					Fifteen minutes really helps with reading dense material. 
					Keep your book handy and knock out a few pages at a time. 
					Your mind won’t wander and you can eliminate long sessions 
					of mind-numbing reading. Staring at complex material for many 
					hours at a time is difficult to do, and the material is even more 
					difficult to absorb. Cater to your short attention span; even 
					better—make it work for you as a strategic weapon!

					routine often. Trainers do this because they don’t want your 
					muscles to adapt to your current routine, at which point you 
					gain less from your workout session. Your brain is the same way 
					and can “tune out” if it’s not continuously stimulated. “Switch 
					it up” refers to the material you’re studying at any one session.

					Excellent students kept telling me that mixing up their study 
					material helped them learn more, and to be honest I didn’t buy 
					it until I tried it myself. Now, I’m a believer. Let’s say Lindsay has 
					a 2-hour study session scheduled. She knows not to schedule 
					more than 2 hours but wants to get maximum benefit from 
					her 2-hour commitment. If Lindsay isn’t efficient, she may get 
					less than 2 hours of value out of her session and would have 
					to study more later. So she decides to study chemistry for 1 
					hour, take a short break to walk around, and then read for her 
					literature class for the second hour. Lindsay’s plan is an excellent way to stay mentally engaged and learn more. And learning 
					more is the ultimate goal. It’s tough to focus for a long period 
					of time, no matter how interested you are in a subject. When 
					you switch up material, you re-engage your brain and you’re 
					ready to absorb.

					Switching material has the added benefit of helping you maintain balance in your classes. While not every class requires 
					the same amount of study hours, they all do require attention. 
					If you’re switching up your material and tracking your hours, 
					you’ll strike a balance more quickly, which will help you keep 
					on track in all of your classes.

					<strong>4. Limit procrastination</strong>
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					We all know that procrastination can destroy your chances of 
					succeeding academically. It’s the dominant reason your classmates pull all-nighters and perform horribly. Not only is it bad 
					for learning, it increases your stress levels. If you decide not 
					to study in order to see a local band play, you probably tell

					yourself it will be a nice stress reliever. The fact is, you’ll be 
					thinking about what you should be doing, so the feeling of 
					procrastination causes you more stress. Seeing the band has 
					now had the opposite effect that you intended. If, on the other 
					hand, you check your study tracker and you’re right where 
					you want to be, you go can out, have fun, and not worry about 
					academics. That is a true stress reliever.

					<em>Scheduling your study hours first and filling those hours 
					with tasks second is designed to defeat procrastination.</em> Many 
					of my students resisted tracking study hours at first because 
					it sounded like a chore, even though it takes only a minute or 
					so a day. Yet once they started tracking, they all responded, 
					“Tracking helps me resist procrastinating.” Tracking acts as a 
					daily reminder of where you need to be.

					When the little voice in your heads says, “You need to study 
					[fill in class]”, but you rationalize why studying can wait; that’s 
					the procrastination train getting started. The earlier you stop 
					that train, the better. If the train gets moving, the next phase is, 
					“I have so much to do, and I don’t even know where to start.” 
					Do this: go to your syllabus and start wherever you last left off. 
					Starting anywhere is better than not starting at all.
				</p>

				<p class="indent">
					Procrastination will never be eliminated 100 percent, and 
					we’re all guilty of it. When it happens, learn to give yourself a 
					break. Simply identify it, stop it, and move on. Pick yourself up, 
					dust yourself off, and get back in the fight. Start tracking again 
					and see how quickly you catch up. You can even add hours to 
					your goals to catch up. Remember, a 4.0 GPA doesn’t represent 
					perfection—you only need a 93 percent. You have room for 
					error in college, but not much, so stay balanced in your weekly 
					efforts and you’ll limit your procrastination to a minimum.

					studying outside of the classroom. Learning to study by trial 
					and error takes too much time and causes too much damage 
					to your GPA. Like most habits in this book, study skills are 
					designed to save you time and reduce stress by getting you to 
					maximize the quality of each study hour. When you maximize 
					the quality of each study hour, you minimize your total time 
					spent studying. And now that you’ve learned how to allocate

					approach test taking which just so happens to be the subject 
					of the next chapter.
