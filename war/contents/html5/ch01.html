				<strong>HTML has been on a wild ride.</strong> Sure, HTML started as a mere markup
				language, but more recently HTML's put on some major muscle. Now we've got a language
				tuned for building true web applications with local storage, 2D drawing, offline support,
				sockets and threads, and more. The story of HTML wasn't always pretty, and it's full of
				drama (we'll get to all that), but in this chapter, we're first going to go on a quick
				joyride through Webville to get a sense of everything that goes into "HTML5." Come on,
				hop in, we're headed to Webville, and we're going to start by going from zero to HTML5
				in 3.8 pages (flat).

					After taking a careful look at the HTML in "Upgrade to HTML5 TODAY! Why wait? Use my
					HTML5-o-Matic and do it in only THREE EASY STEPS", can you see any markup that might
					change with HTML5? Or that you'd want to change? We'll point out one for you: the
					<strong><code class="literal">doctype</code></strong> definition:
				</p>

				<div class="hiddencode">

						<img class="codeimage" src="/contents/html5/figs/web2/003fig01.png">

				  		</code>
				  	</div>
				  </div>
				 </div>

				<p>
					Remember, the <strong><code class="literal">doctype</code></strong> definition belongs
					at the top of your HTML file and tells the browser the type of your document, in this
					case, HTML 4.01. By using a doctype the browser is able to be more precise in the
					way it interprets and renders your pages. Using a doctype is highly recommended.
				</p>

				<p>
					So, using your deductive powers, what do you think the
					<strong><code class="literal">doctype</code></strong> definition for HTML5 will
					look like? Write it here (you can refer back to your answer when we cover this in a bit):

			<h2> Introducing the HTML5-o-Matic, update your HTML now!</h2>

			<figure class="left">
				<img src="/contents/html5/figs/web2/004fig01.png">
			</figure>

			<p>
				Step 1 is going to amaze you: follow along, we're going to start at the top of the Head First
				Lounge HTML and update the doctype to give it that new HTML5 shine.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here's the old HTML 4.01 version of the doctype:
			</p>

			<div class="clear" />

<pre><strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"</strong></pre>

<pre>	<strong>"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;</strong></pre>

			<p>
				Now you might have guessed that we're going to replace every mention of "4" with "5"
				in the doctype, right? Oh, no. Here's the amazing part: the new doctype for HTML5 is simply:
			</p>

			<aside class="right">
				Apologies to the crew that got the 4.01 doctype tattoo to remember it.
			</aside>

<pre><strong>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</strong></pre>

			<p>
				No more Googling to remember what the doctype looks like, or copying and pasting from
				another file, this doctype is so simple you can just remember it.
			</p>

			<p>
				But, wait, there's more...
			</p>

			<p>
				Not only is this the doctype for HTML5, it's the doctype for <em>every future version</em>
				of HTML. In other words, it's never going to change again. Not only that, it will work in your older browsers too.
			</p>

			<aside>
				The W3C HTML Standards guys have promised us they really mean it this time. <img src="/contents/html5/figs/web2/004fig04.png">
			</aside>

			<figure class="left">
				<img src="/contents/html5/figs/web2/004fig02.png">
			</figure>

			<p>
				If you're a fan of the <em>Extreme Makeover</em>s or <em>The Biggest Loser</em> television
				shows, you're going to love Step 2. In this step we have the content meta tag... here, check out
				the before/after pictures:
			</p>

			<div class="hiddencode">
				<figure class="center">
					<img class="codeimage" src="/contents/html5/figs/web2/004fig05.png">
				</figure>

				<div class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">
			  	<div class="modal-body">
			  		<code>
			  <pre>&lt;meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"&gt;</pre>
			  			<br />
			  <pre>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</pre>
		  			</code>
		  		</div>
		  	</div>
		  </div>

			<p>
				Yes, the new meta tag <del>has lost a lot of weight</del> is much simpler. When you specify
				the meta tag in HTML5, just supply the tag along with a character encoding. Believe it or not,
				all browsers (old and new) already understand this meta description, so you can use it on any
				page and it <em>just works</em>.
			</p>

<!-- Page 5 -->

			<div class="pagebreak pageNumber">5</div> 

			<figure class="left">
				<img src="/contents/html5/figs/web2/005fig01.png">
			</figure>

			<p>
				And now for Step 3, the step that brings it all home. Here we're also going to focus on the
				&lt;head&gt; element and upgrade the link tag. Here's what we have now: a link of type text/css
				that points to a stylesheet:
			</p>

			<div class="hiddencode">
				<figure class="center">
					<img class="codeimage" src="/contents/html5/figs/web2/005fig03.png">
				</figure>

				<div class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">
			  	<div class="modal-body">
			  		<code>
			  <pre>&lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="lounge.css"&gt;</pre>
			  		</code>
			  	</div>
				</div>
		 	</div>

			<p>
				To upgrade this for HTML5, we just need to remove the type attribute. Why? Because CSS has
				been declared the standard, and default, style for HTML5. So, after we remove the type attribute,
				the new link looks like this:
			</p>

			<div class="hiddencode">
				<figure class = "center">
					<img class="codeimage" src="/contents/html5/figs/web2/005fig04.png">
				</figure>

				<div class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">
			  	<div class="modal-body">
			  		<code>
			  <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="lounge.css"&gt;</pre>
			  		</code>
			  	</div>
			  </div>
			 </div>

			<figure class ="left">
				<img src="/contents/html5/figs/web2/005fig02.png">
			</figure>

			<p>
				And, because you acted fast, we've got a special bonus for you. We're going to make your life
				even easier by simplifying the script tag. With HTML5, JavaScript is now the standard and default
				scripting language, so you can remove the type attribute from your script tags too. Here's what
				the new script tag looks like without the type attribute:
			</p>

			<div class="hiddencode">
				<figure class="center">
					<img class="codeimage" src="/contents/html5/figs/web2/005fig05.png">
				</figure>

				<div class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">
			  	<div class="modal-body">
			  		<code>
			  <pre>&lt;script src="lounge.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
			  		</code>
			  	</div>
			  </div>
			 </div>

			<p>
				Or if you have some inline code, you can just write your script like this:
			</p>

			<div class="hiddencode">
				<figure class="center">
					<img class="codeimage" src="/contents/html5/figs/web2/005fig06.png">
				</figure>

			  <pre>	var youRock = true;</pre>
			  <pre>&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
			  		</code>

				<strong>Okay, okay, you got us.</strong> So far, we've been talking about updating your older HTML
				pages so that they're ready to take advantage of everything HTML5 has to offer. And as you can see,
				if you're familiar with HTML 4.01, then you're in great shape because HTML5 is a superset of HTML 4.01
				(meaning practically everything in it is still supported in HTML5) and all you need to do is know
				how to specify your <code class="literal">doctype</code> and the rest of the tags in the
				<code class="literal">&lt;head&gt;</code> element to get started with HTML5.
			</p>

			<p>
				But, you're right, we were being silly, of course there is more to HTML5 than just updating a few
				elements. In fact, what everyone is excited about is the ability to build rich, interactive pages
				(or even sophisticated web applications), and to support that, HTML5 provides a whole family
				of technologies that works hand in hand with the HTML5 markup language.
			</p>

			<p>
				But hang on; before we get there we've got just a bit more work to do to make sure we're ready with our markup.

									<p>
										Yes, through a bit of cleverness and luck. Take the type attributes on the link and script
										tags; now, it makes sense to get rid of this attribute with HTML5 because CSS and JavaScript
										are now the standards (and certainly are the default technologies for style and scripting).
										But as it turns out, the browsers already assumed the defaults of CSS and JavaScript. So the
										stars aligned and the new markup standard just happens to have been supported in the browser
										for years. The same is true of the doctype and the meta tag.

								<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">
									<p>
										Yes, it does seem a little magical that after years of using complex doctypes we can now
										just simplify it to "we're using HTML." Here's what happened: HTML used to be based on a
										standard called SGML, and that standard required both the complex form of the doctype and
										the DTD. The new standard has moved away from SGML as a way to simplify HTML language and
										make it more flexible. So, we don't need the complex form anymore. Further, as we said
										above, there is some luck here in that almost all browsers just look for HTML in the
										doctype to ensure they are parsing an HTML document.

										<strong>Were you joking about it never changing again? I thought the versioning was

										The use of the doctype evolved with browser makers using the doctype to tell
										their browsers to render things in their own "standards mode." Now that we have

										Yes, browsers are great at overlooking small errors in HTML files. But by including
										the correct doctype and meta tags, you'll make sure browsers know exactly what you
										want, rather than having to guess. Plus, for people using older browsers, the new
										doctype means they'll use standards mode, which is what you want. Remember, standards
										mode is a mode where the browser assumes you're writing HTML that conforms to a
										standard, so it uses those rules to interpret your page. If you don't specify a
										doctype, some browsers may go into "quirks mode" and assume your web page is written
										for older browsers, when the standard wasn't quite up to snuff, and may interpret
										your page incorrectly (or assume it's just written incorrectly).

										Yeah it was. Then flexibility won out over strict syntax, and in the process XHTML
										(XHTML 2, to be precise) died and HTML5 was born to be more accepting of the way
										people write web pages (and the way browsers render them). That said, don't worry,
										because knowing about XHTML is only going to make you a stronger author of HTML5
										content (and you're going to appreciate HTML5 a whole lot more). And by the way,

				<h3> We don't expect you to know HTML5, yet.</h3>

				<p>
					If you've never had exposure to HTML5 before, that's okay, but you should have worked with

					the difference between semantic markup and adding style, and so on.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you aren't familiar with all these, we're going to make a small suggestion (and a shameless
					plug): there's another book that precedes this one, <em>Head First HTML with CSS &amp; XHTML</em>,
					and you should read it. And if you're somewhat familar with markup languages, you might want to
					skim it or use it as a reference while reading this book.

					<strong>This week's interview: Confessions of the newest version of HTML</strong>
				</h2>

				<p>
					<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>Head First:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Welcome, HTML5. All
					the Web is buzzing about you. To us, you look a lot like HTML 4. Why is everyone so excited?
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>HTML5:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Everyone's excited because
					I'm enabling a whole new generation of web applications and experiences.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>Head First:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Right, but again, why didn't HTML
					4 or even the promise of "XHTML" do that?
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>HTML5:</strong>&nbsp;</span>XHTML 2 was a dead-end.
					Everyone who wrote real web pages hated it. XHTML reinvented the way we write markup for a web
					page, and would have made all the pages already out there obsolete. I said, "Hey, wait a sec, I
					can do new things and embrace everything that is already out there." I mean, if something works,
					why reinvent the wheel? That's my philosophy.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>Head First:</strong>&nbsp;</span>It seems to be working.
					But you know, some of the standards guys are still saying that the Web would be better off following
					their "pure" standards.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>HTML5:</strong>&nbsp;</span>You know, I don't really care.
					I listen to the people out there writing real web pages—how are they using me, and how can I help?
					Second on my list are the developers creating the web browsers. And last on my list are the standards
					guys. I'll listen to them, but not if it disagrees with what real users are doing.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>Head First:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Why not?
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>HTML5:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Because if the users and
					the browser-makers disagree with the standards guys, it is a moot point. Luckily the people
					working on the HTML5 spec totally agree with me, and that's our philosophy.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>Head First:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Back to the previous
					version of HTML, you've said you are a superset of HTML 4.01. That means you're backward-compatible,
					right? Does that mean you're going to have to keep handling all the bad designs of the past?
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>HTML5:</strong>&nbsp;</span>I promise I'll do my best to
					handle anything from the past that is thrown at me. That said, it doesn't mean that is the way to
					treat me. I do want web page authors to be educated on the latest standard and use me in the best
					way possible. That way, they can really push me to my limits. But again, I won't totally fail, and
					I will display an old page to the best of my ability if it's not updated.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>Head First:</strong>&nbsp;</span>My next question is ...
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>HTML5:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Hold on, hold on!!! All
					these questions about the past. We aren't talking about what is important here. As far as my
					markup is concerned, my personal mission is to embrace the Web as it is, add some new structured
					elements that make web author's lives easier, and to help all browser implementors support
					consistent semantics around my markup. But I'm really here to pitch my new purpose: web applica...
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>Head First:</strong>&nbsp;</span>...So sorry HTML5,
					that's all we have time for. Thanks, and we'll be sure to talk about anything you want in an upcoming interview.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>HTML5:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Argh, I hate when that happens!!!

			<p>
				Okay, you've patiently humored us by sitting through our "HTML5-o-Matic" skit, and we're
				sure you've already guessed there's a lot more to HTML5 than that. The word on the street
				is that HTML5 removes the need for plug-ins, can be used for everything from simple pages
				to Quake-style games and is a whipped topping for desserts. HTML5 seems to be something different to everyone...

				So we've said HTML5 is made up of a family of technologies, but what does that mean? Well
				you already know there's the HTML markup itself, which has been expanded to include some new

				to style your pages. And then there's the turbo charger: <em>JavaScript</em>, and a whole
				new set of JavaScript APIs that are available to you.

					You'll find most of the family below, so go ahead mingle, see if you can figure out who is

			<strong>YOUR MISSION...</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				...should you choose to accept it, is to do some reconnaissance on all the HTML browsers.
				We're sure you've heard some browsers are ready for HTML5, and some aren't. We need for you
				to get in close, because the truth is out there...

			<p>
				Even though it will be a while before the standard gets signed, sealed and delivered,
				you'll be using browsers that fully support HTML5 long before then. In fact, on modern
				browsers many features are already supported across the board. That's why it's a great
				idea to get started using HTML5 now. Plus if you start now, you'll be able to impress your
				friends and coworkers with all your cutting edge knowledge.
			</p>

				<strong>Hold on, take a deep breath.</strong>

			<figure class="right">
				<img src="/contents/html5/figs/web2/019fig01.png">
			</figure>

			<p>
				First of all HTML5 is a superset of HTML, and so your goal should be to write
				<em>only one</em> HTML page. You're right in that the features supported by any one browser
				may differ, depending on how current the browser is, and how aggressive your users are in
				upgrading. So, we need to keep in mind that some of the newer features of HTML5 might not
				be supported, which leads back to your question of how to handle that.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, one of the design principles behind HTML5 is to allow your pages to degrade gracefully—that
				means if your user's browser doesn't provide a new feature, then you should provide a meaningful
				alternative. In this book we're going to show you how to write your pages to do that.
			</p>

			<p class="margin-right">
				But the good news is that all browsers are moving towards the HTML5 standard and related
				technologies (even the mobile browsers) and so over time graceful degradation will be more
				the exception than the rule (although you'll always want to do what you can to give your users
				a meaningful experience no matter what browser they're on).

			<div class="margin-right">
				<p>
					If you've been with us since <em>Head First HTML &amp; CSS</em> (or, you've read this far into
					the book without repurposing it as firewood) we know you probably have a good understanding of
					using markup languages and stylesheets to create great looking web pages. Knowing those two
					technologies can get you a long way...
				</p>

				<p>
					But, with HTML5 things are changing: web pages are becoming rich experiences (and full blown
					applications) that have behavior, are updated on the fly, and interact with the user. Building
					these kinds of pages requires a fair bit of programming and if you're going to write code for
					the browser, there's only one game in town: <em>JavaScript</em>.
				</p>

				<aside class="right">
					We can't think of a better or more fun way to learn to program!
				</aside>

				<p>
					Now, if you've programmed or written simple scripts before, you're going to be in good shape:
					JavaScript (despite some rumors) is a fantastic language and we'll take you through everything
					you need to know to write the applications in this book. If you haven't programmed before,
					we're going to do everything we can to take you along for the ride. In either case, one of
					the huge benefits of JavaScript is how accessible it is to new programmers.
				</p>

				<p>
					So, what now? Let's just briefly get introduced to a little JavaScript and then we'll really
					dive in deep in Chapter 2. In fact, for now, don't worry too much about getting every detail
					over the next few pages—we just want you to get a <em>feel for JavaScript.</em>

				<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>JavaScript:</strong>&nbsp;</span>That's easy.
				If you want to really master HTML5, spend your time on JavaScript and all the libraries that work with HTML5.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>Head First:</strong>&nbsp;</span>You know, you haven't
				always had the best reputation. I'll quote a review from 1998: "JavaScript is at best a half-baked,
				wimpy scripting language."
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>JavaScript:</strong>&nbsp;</span>That hurts. I may
				not have started life in the clean, academic environment of many programming languages, but
				I've become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time, so I wouldn't
				discount me so quickly. Not only that, but enormous resources have been poured into making
				me robust and extremely fast. I'm at least 100 times faster than I was a decade ago.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>Head First:</strong>&nbsp;</span>That's impressive.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>JavaScript:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Oh, and if you haven't
				heard, the standards guys also just told me I'm now the default scripting language for HTML5. So,
				I'm here to stay. In fact, you don't even have to say "JavaScript" in your
				<code class="literal">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag anymore. So they may have called me wimpy in
				‘98, but where are JScript, VBScript, Java Applets and all those failed attempts at browser languages now?
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>Head First:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Well it certainly
				sounds like you are the key to creating great HTML5 experiences. You do have a reputation
				for being a confusing language.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>JavaScript:</strong>&nbsp;</span>I'm a very powerful
				language, despite some rumors, so you should really spend some time learning to use me well
				 On the other hand, I'm popular because I'm so easy to get up and running with. The best o
				  both worlds, don't you think?
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="formalpara-title"><strong>Head First:</strong>&nbsp;</span>It sounds that

			<h3>Writing Serious JavaScript</h3>

			<p>
				With all this talk about JavaScript, we bet you're ready to jump in and see what it's all
				about. They don't call this <em>Head First</em> for nothing, we've got a super serious
				business application below that we're going to throw at you. For now, get started by going
				through the code to get a feel for it. Write down what you think each line does. Don't
				worry, we don't expect you to understand everything yet, but we bet you can make some
				really good guesses about what this code does. And, when you're done, turn the page and
				see how close you were...

								<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">
									<p>
										We chose to start with an empty body because we created all the content for
										this page using JavaScript code. Now, sure, we could have just typed the song
										lyrics directly into the body element (and that would have taken a lot of typing),
										or we can have code do all the hard work for us (which we did), and then just have
										the code insert the lyrics into the page with document.write.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Keep in mind we're just getting our feet wet here; we're going to spend a
										lot more time in this book seeing how we can take a page and dynamically fill
										in its content with code.

								<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">
									<p>
										Well, document.write takes a string of text and inserts it into the document;
										in fact, it outputs the string precisely where the script tag is located. So,
										in this case document.write outputs the string right into the body of the page.
									</p>

										That's a great question because we're using the terms loosely. There's no
										technical difference between the two; in other words, there's nothing special
										you do to turn a page written with HTML, JavaScript and/or CSS into a web application.
										The distinction is more one of perspective.
									</p>
								
									<p>
										When we have a page that is acting more like an application than just a static
										document, then we start thinking of it as a web application and less as a web page.
										We think of applications as having a number of qualities such as holding lots of
										state, managing more complex interactions with the user, displaying dynamic and
										constantly updated data without a page refresh, or even doing more complex tasks or calculations.

										Yes, CSS has come a long way and we're thrilled it works so well with HTML5.
										Now, while this book isn't about CSS3, you can be sure we're going to take full
										advantage of some of its new capabilities. As you might know, many of the tricks
										we used to do to add rounded corners and shadows with images in HTML, and simple
										animation with JavaScript, can now be easily done with CSS3.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										So, yes, we're going to make use of the power of CSS3 in this book, and we'll
										point out when we're doing so.

					<strong>We'll give you our unofficial answer:</strong>
				</p>

				<figure class="center">
					<img src="/contents/html5/figs/web2/029fig02.png">
				</figure>

				<p>
					You see, when most people are talking about the promise of HTML5, what they mean is all
					of these technologies combined. That is, we have markup to build the core structure of our
					pages, we have JavaScript along with all its APIs to add behavior and new functionality,
					and we have CSS to style our pages—and together, these are the technologies we're all going
					to use to build tomorrow's web apps.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now, why did we say unofficial? Well, there are people who like to make hard distinctions
					among these technologies and which standard each belongs to. And that is fine and has its
					place. But, what we care about is this: what technologies are available in the browser, and
					are they ready for us to use to craft our pages and applications? So, we say HTML5 is markup
					+ JavaScript APIs + CSS, and we think that is what people generally mean when talking about
					HTML5 as a technology.
				</p>

				<aside class="right">
					If you're really interested in how these technologies fit together as a set of
					standards (and we all should be) then we encourage you to visit w3.org for more information.
