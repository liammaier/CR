			<h1> Chapter 2: iOS 5 Device Basics </h1>

			<p>iOS 5 devices have a ton of cool features and are really fun to play with, but they have a very practical side as
				well. We'll touch on some of the cool features, but our focus in this book will be more on the practical side. I know,
				you'd rather have fun, but just because something is practical doesn't mean it can't be fun, too.</p>

			<p>At the present time, there are three iOS 5 devices: the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad. Although each device has its
				own unique technical specifications as shown in Table 2-1 below, they all share the same powerful operating system
				(iOS 5) which includes many helpful built-in apps.</p>

			<h2>Getting to Know the iOS 5 Devices</h2>

			<p>Let's start with a general orientation to the various iOS 5 devices. Devices may change slightly when new versions
				become available; however, they all share these common features.</p>

			<p>Figure 2-1 shows the front of the iPod Touch 4 and the iPhone, while Figure 2-2 shows the front of the iPad 2. It
				is important to note that the iPod Touch 4, iPhone 4 and 4S, and iPad 2 all have both front and back facing cameras.
				Only the front facing camera is shown in the tables below.</p>

			<p>There are several physical (external) controls common across devices:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Sleep/Wake button</strong>  &mdash;  As with many devices, the iOS 5 devices can be placed in sleep mode
					or turned off completely. Sleep mode allows the device to "wake up" quickly when the Home button is pressed or when
					the Sleep/Wake button is pressed; whereas turning the device off requires a short "turn on" time when you turn it
					back on. 
					
					<ol>
						<li><em>Sleep/Wake</em>  &mdash;  Briefly pressing the Sleep/Wake button wakes the device up or puts it to
							sleep.</li>
						<li><em>On/Off</em>  &mdash;  Pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake button turns the device on or off.</li>

					<li>Visual memory</li>
					<li>Similarities & differences</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The first Making Cognitive Connections (MCC) exercise focuses on getting oriented to the external controls of
					your iOS 5 device. The process of orienting yourself involves paying close attention to details, including the
					objects' location, size, shape, etc.</p>
				<p>Focusing on visual details will help provide an effective visual memory compensation technique. In addition,
					it will help in comparing and contrasting objects. This strategy can be used in different settings to help with
					orientation, memory, and identifying similarities and differences among various items.</p>

			<p>You might be wondering what to do when the device locks while you are playing music. Not to worry; you can
				double-press the Home button to display and use the playback controls without unlocking the device.</p>

			<h2>The Home Screen</h2>

			<p>The Home screen is the screen that appears after the device is unlocked. It provides a number of built-in
				applications (apps) we will explore in this book, including Calendar, Contacts, Clock, Calculator, and Notes
				(among others). Figure 2-4 shows a sample Home screen for iOS 5 on the iPhone (note the Phone icon in the lower
				left corner of the screen).</p>

			<p>If you are the least bit curious (like me), you might start tapping apps on the Home Screen before you really
				know what they do. Any time you get yourself lost and need to get back to the Home screen, press the Home button
				located at the bottom center of the device.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Tap the Reminders app icon.</li>
				<li>Press the Home button to return to the Home screen.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>In addition, you might be wondering what the numbers in a circle (known as Alert Badges) at the upper right corner
				of some icons mean (see Figure 2-4). The Alert Badges indicate the number of new and/or overdue activities associated
				with that app. For example:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The Alert Badge (2) associated with the App Store indicates there are two updates available for previously
					downloaded apps. </li>
				<li>The Alert Badge (8) associated with the Todo app indicates there are a total of 8 tasks that are either current
					or overdue. </li>
				<li>The Alert Badge (7) associated with the Mail app indicates there are 7 unread e- mail messages. </li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Now that you have a big picture reference for the Home screen and you know how to get back to the Home screen at
				any time, let's divide the screen into sections and explore their various functions.</p>
						
			<section class="subsection" data-number="4" data-name="The Status Bar">

				<h3>The Status Bar</h3>

				<p>The top part of the screen is called the Status Bar (see Figure 2-5). The status bar for the iPhone will display
					the wireless carrier and strength of the wireless signal (shown in bars to the left of the carrier name).</p>

					<h4>Home Screen Page Reference</h4>

					<p>The Home Screen Page Reference appears when more than one Home screen page is created. Additional Home
						screens can be created to help organize your apps. Figure 2-8 shows the Home Screen Page Reference section
						indicating there are two additional Home screens. You will see the page reference concept in many iOS 5 apps.</p>

					<p>Notice in the figure above there is a magnifying glass and three circles. Let's focus on the circles for
						just a moment, then go back to the magnifying glass.</p>
					
<!-- Page 22 -->

					<div class="pagebreak">

					</div>
					
					<p>The three circles indicate three Home screens. The white circle indicates the current Home screen. In
						Figure 2-8, we are on the main (first) Home screen. The gray circles indicate additional Home screens.</p>
					
					<p>Figures 2-9 and 2-10 below show two additional Home screens, each with different apps. It is very easy to
						acquire so many apps that you get lost on your own device. The Home screen page reference section should help
						to orient you.</p>

					<p>Additional Home screens can be used to help organize or categorize apps. You might be wondering why some of the
						icons on the screen look like app icons and some look like they contain several tiny app icons. iOS 5 allows you to
						create folders. Folders are a great way of organizing similar apps into one location. In Figure 2-8 above, I have a
						folder at the top left of my screen called Books. I have stored my iBooks and Kindle apps in this folder so I can
						quickly find all my e-book-related apps. We'll talk more about folders and how to create them in the next
						chapter.</p>

					<p>Before we move on to the next section of the screen, let's go back and explore the magnifying glass.
						The 	magnifying glass is the icon that represents the Search feature of the device.</p>

					<p>Figure 2-11 shows the iOS 5 Search screen.</p>

								<li>Touch the main Home screen and slide from left to right.</li>
							</ul>

					<p>The Search feature will search through many of the built-in apps that come with the device for a specific
						keyword or phrase:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Contacts  &mdash;  searches First, Last, and Company Name fields</li>
						<li>Mail  &mdash;  searches To, From, Subject, and Message fields</li>
						<li>Calendar  &mdash;  searches Event titles, invitees, locations and notes fields</li>
						<li>Music  &mdash;  searches song names, artists, and albums</li>
						<li>Messages  &mdash;  searches names and text of messages</li>
						<li>Notes  &mdash;  searches text of notes</li>
						<li>Reminders  &mdash;  searches titles of reminders</li>
					</ul>

					<p>In addition, Safari searches include the Web and/or Wikipedia.</p>

				<h3>Multitasking</h3>

				<p>Multitasking is a great feature of iOS 5 that allows you to quickly switch between open apps. In other words,
					if you want to jump to an open app without having to find it on one of your Home Screens or in a folder, you
					can find it on the Multitasking Bar.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Double-press the Home button.</li>
							<li>Switch to any open app by tapping its icon.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
	
				<p>The multitasking bar will appear at the bottom of the Home screen. All recently opened apps will appear in the
					bar. You will see up to four apps at a time; however, you can flick to the right to see any additional apps
					that have been recently opened.</p>

				<p>When an app is opened, it doesn't automatically close. In fact, when you hit the Home button to return to the
					Home screen, the app is left open. It is a good idea to periodically close all the open apps. This can help with
					memory conservation and may even speed up your device. The device can get a bit bogged down if you have 10 or so
					apps open at the same time. I would suggest actually closing apps by using the multitasking bar once a week or
					so.</p>
				
				<div class="instructions">
					<div class="interior">
						<p>To Close and Remove Apps from the Multitasking Bar</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Double-press the Home button to bring up the multitasking bar.</li>
							<li>Tap and hold one of the app icons until the icons start to wiggle.</li>
							<li>Tap the red circle to close an open app and remove it from the multitasking bar. Don't worry;
								removing an app from the multitasking bar does not delete it from the device.</li>
							<li>Press the Home button to save the changes (and stop the wiggling).</li>
							<li>Press the Home button again to return to the Home screen.</li>
