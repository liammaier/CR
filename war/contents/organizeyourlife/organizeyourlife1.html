			<h1>Chapter 1: Making Cognitive Connections </h1>

			<p>You may have looked at the title of this book and thought, "I can always use help organizing
				my life, but what is this Making Cognitive Connections thing all about?" Making Cognitive Connections is a
				particular approach to learning information. Typically, as we learn about a new device, we just want to know how
				to do a specific task. In fact, most of us just start playing with the technology and learn as we go. This
				approach isn't necessarily the best approach for everyone &mdash; that's where the Making Cognitive Connections 
				approach comes in.</p>

			<p>The idea behind the Making Cognitive Connections approach involves learning to use technology while actually
				becoming aware of the cognitive skills (e.g., attention to detail, critical thinking, etc.)
				involved in learning
				the technology. For example, becoming aware of and focusing your attention on the cognitive skills involved in
				learning the iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch can provide a foundation for learning other types of technology. In
				addition, the Making Cognitive Connections approach can help to provide insights into how those same cognitive
				skills can be used in other, less technology-related aspects of your life.</p>

			<h2>Design of the Book</h2>

			<p>Many users find typical iOS device or smartphone manuals frustrating and overly technical.
				<strong>This book is different.</strong> It is much more than just a reference source, although you
				<em>will</em> learn lots of iOS 5 functions and you can refer back to the book
				as often as needed. But in addition to being a fine
				reference, this book is consciously structured to be a learning tool for individuals with cognitive challenges
				(e.g., issues with memory or organization); in fact, it was written with input from such individuals. As you work
				through the book, not only will you master most functions of iOS 5 devices; you will also see how the skills you
				apply to the device relate to your everyday life.</p>

			<p>For each iOS 5 function, you will:</p>

			<ul class="circlePoints">
				<li>Read about what it is and how to do it;</li>
				<li>Follow steps to perform that function on the device;</li>
				<li>Make the cognitive connection by learning what cognitive skills are being used to perform the task; and</li>
				<li>Identify real-life examples from outside the realm of the iOS devices that require you to use the same
					cognitive skills.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This book even includes fill-in graphic organizers like matrices and comparison charts so that you will have
				structured guidance in learning important features of the devices.</p>

<!-- Page 2 -->

			<div class="pagebreak">
				<span class="pageNumber">2</span> Organize Your Life Using iOS5
			</div>

			<p>There are lots of cognitive exercises out there designed to build new neural pathways (physical connections
				within the brain) &mdash; paper and pencil tasks, computer games or exercises &mdash; and lots of memory
				compensation strategies (e.g., paper calendars and organizers, lists, portable and non-portable electronic calendars
				and organizers). What's different here is the link between the training to use an electronic tool people enjoy using
				as a memory compensation and organization device, the identification of the underlying cognitive skills involved,
				and the opportunities for you to identify applications to your life.</p>

			<p>Before you begin working your way though this book, I want to take this time to assure you that this book was
				written with the following intentions:</p>

			<ol>
				<li><strong>To present information in a way that isn't too overwhelming:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Each chapter is written with short paragraphs. </li>
						<li>Each chapter has lots of white space to break up the text. </li>
						<li>Steps are provided as easy-to-follow bulleted lists. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li><strong>To include relevant images or pictures to help you know you are in the right place:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Each chapter contains pictures that correspond with the information seen on the device screen. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li><strong>To include practice exercises to emphasize skills:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Each chapter includes numerous "Give It a Try" activities, allowing you to practice immediately after a
							skill is introduced.</li>
						<li>Each chapter includes "Making Cognitive Connections" exercises designed to help you see how the same
							skills being used on the device apply to your everyday life.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Importance of a Training Partner</h2>

			<p>You can use this book working alone, but it's a great idea to recruit a professional (e.g.,
			therapist or teacher), or at least a relative or friend, to help you. Such a person can be a resource for staying
			on track and can serve as a sounding board to discuss applications to your own life. After you complete each exercise,
			you can check in with your training partner to discuss the outcome. Spend some time demonstrating how to perform the
			new iOS 5 function and then brainstorm what other applications of that particular skill may be issues in your life.
			Problems with memory or other cognitive challenges may make it hard for you to recall or identify incidents of
			cognitive difficulty, so you and your partner may need to get additional information from someone who has observed
			you at work, at home, or at play.</p>

			<h2>Making Cognitive Connections</h2>

			<p>Every step you perform with iOS 5 devices involves using particular cognitive skills (e.g., attention to detail,
			visual memory). This book helps you identify the skills you are using to perform each function. Just as important, the
			book helps you to make associations to the experiences in your life that involve the same skills. As you've read, we
			call this <em>Making Cognitive Connections</em>, and you will find one or more "Making Cognitive Connections" exercises
			in each chapter.</p>

			<p>In Table 1-1 below, you can see the link between the cognitive skill(s) used to perform the iOS 5 functions and
				the life tasks that also require the same skill(s). Don't feel like you need to memorize this table. As you complete
				the various "Making Cognitive Connections" exercises throughout the book, you may find it useful to refer back to
				this table to help generate examples of activities in your own life.</p>
