			<h1> Chapter 3: More iOS 5 Basics</h1>

			<p>Chapter 2 focused on the external device basics as well as an orientation to the iOS 5 Home screen and standard or built-in
				apps. Now we&#39;ll focus on a few more details associated with getting the device up and running (e.g., setting the date and
				time) and some effective ways to organize the Home screens so you can quickly find the app you want to use.</p>

			<h2>iCloud</h2>

			<p>iCloud is new to iOS 5 and replaces MobileMe. When this feature is turned on, iCloud provides the opportunity to store information such as:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Mail</li>
				<li>Contacts</li>
				<li>Calendars</li>
				<li>Reminders</li>
				<li>Bookmarks</li>
				<li>Notes</li>
				<li>Photos (via Photo Stream)</li>
				<li>Documents &amp Data (purchased music, apps, books)</li>
				<li>Find My iPhone (or iOS device being used</li>
			</ul>

			<p>You must set up an online account using an Apple ID to use iCloud. Steps to establish an Apple ID and iCloud account can
				be found at icloud.com or apple.com. It&#39;s not a bad idea to set up an iCloud account as a way of backing up your device.
				In addition to the list provided above, iCloud backs up purchases made directly from the device, including those made from
				the App Store and iTunes.</p>

			<p>We talked about additional Home screens and why you might create them for organizational purposes (e.g., keeping

			<h2>Creating Folders</h2>

			<p>Folders are yet another way you can organize the various apps you will accumulate over time. Utilizing folders
				allows you to create and name folders and then place similar apps within the folder for better organization (See Figure 3-9).
				You can include up to 12 apps in any folder. iOS 5 will attempt to name all new folders based on the type of app(s)
				placed in that folder (e.g., travel). Not to worry&#45;you can always rename the folder so that it makes sense to you
				(e.g., notetaking, games, finance, etc.).</p>

				<p>iOS devices have hundreds of thousands of available apps that can be purchased online. One issue that often arises
					is that people download so many apps, they become totally overwhelmed. Adding additional Home screens and/or creating
					folders may help you to keep your apps organized. As new apps are downloaded, they can be placed on Home screens or
					in folders based on category (e.g., games, fitness, business, productivity, etc.).</p>
						
				<h2>MCC &amp; iOS Devices</h2>
						
				<p>Using various Home screens to organize your apps is one way to go, but there is a drawback &#45; you can't
					label your screens. In many cases, a better solution is to create folders to group apps.</p>
						
				<p>Naming folders is a perfect opportunity to work on categorization skills as well as relevant vs. irrelevant. To begin,
					you should look at the apps on your device and identify which ones go together or share common themes. For instance,
					you could have several apps associated with travel (e.g., American Airlines, United Airlines, Orbitz, etc.), or several
					word game apps (e.g., Words with Friends, Scrabble, etc.), or even several notetaking apps (e.g., Awesome Note, EverNote,
					SimpleMind+, etc.). </p>
						
				<p>A good way to organize the various apps on your device is to categorize the apps into groups and then move them to
					folders with names relevant to the overall category.</p>
						
				<p>Identify several categories of apps based on your interest and provide relevant folder names.<p>
						
				<ul>
					<li>Word Games</li>
					<li>Strategy Games</li>
					<li>Travel</li>
					<li>Notetaking</li><br>
					<li>_____________________________________________________________</li>
					<li>_____________________________________________________________</li>
					<li>_____________________________________________________________</li>
					<li>_____________________________________________________________</li>
					<li>_____________________________________________________________</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2> MCC @ School &amp; Work</h2>
				
				<p>How does the placement of apps on relevant Home screens and/or in folders relate to real life? Think about the paperwork
					you have to deal with in school, at work, or at home. The easiest way to deal with overwhelming amounts of paperwork is
					to sort the papers into categories so that everything isn&#39t all thrown together in one place.</p>
				
				<p>For instance, it is easier to find an assignment for your history class if it is in a section of a folder labeled History.
					The tendency might be to just stick the history information in the front of the notebook, rather than in its designated
					section. Another example might be organizing bills at</p>

				<h3>Siri</h3>

				<p>Siri is a new addition to the Apple iPhone and is currently available only on the iPhone 4S. Siri is a voice
					recognition app that will impact not only how the iPhone is used in general, but also who can use an iPhone. For
					instance, some people may avoid using an iPhone because of the onscreen keyboard or because they have a hard
					time spelling. Siri will potentially change all that. Imagine saying, &#8220;Set alarm for 3:00 pm everyday&#8221;
					and having the device do just that. Siri will typically repeat what it hears you say and then provide a response
					and/or a question related to your commands (e.g., &#8220;Would you like to confirm the alarm?&#8221;).</p>
				
				<p>Although this feature will make a huge difference in how we use the device, it isn&#39;t perfect. It is still important
					to learn the fundamental (non-Siri) way to do things on your device so that, when Siri doesn&#39;t quite get it right,
					you&#39;ll be able to swoop in and save the day!</p>

				<p>I will mention some of the apps Siri integrates with below; however, a more detailed discussion about Siri
					and how it integrates will appear as appropriate in future chapters.</p>

				<p>Siri has the ability to work with the following apps:<p>

				<ul>
					<li>Phone</li>
					<li>Messaages</li>
					<li>Calendar</li>
					<li>Reminders</li>
					<li>Maps</li>
					<li>Mail</li>
					<li>Clock</li>
					<li>Contacts</li>
					<li>Notes</li>
					<li>Music</li>
					<li>Safari</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Look for the Siri Basics box, as shown below, as you work your way through the book.</p>

				<div class="siri-basics"> 
					<h3>Siri Basics</h3>

					<p>The Siri Basics box will include suggestions on how to use Siri within the context of the app currently being
						discussed (e.g., the Clock app). The box will appear after the detailed instructions because, although Siri will
						make a significant difference in how some people use their iPhone, it is essential that you know how to use the
						app independently. For instance, what if Siri doesn&#39;t set the alarm exactly as you wanted? You will need to
						know how to go in and modify information. So, please don&#39;t just jump to the Siri Basics box; learn the
						fundamentals first and then learn how to utilize Siri as a potential enhanced productivity tool.</p>

					<p>IMPORTANT&#45;One thing that is consistent among apps that can utilize Siri is the following:</p>

					<p>Whenever you are in an app and the onscreen keyboard appears, waiting for you to enter text, look for
						the microphone symbol. If you see it, Siri can help:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Tap a field.</li>
						<li>Tap the microphone</li>
						<li>Speak aloud the information the field should contain.</li>
						<li>Tap Done.</li>
						<li>Check to make sure that what Siri &#8220;heard&#8221; is what you really said.</li>

			<p>Several things will directly impact the duration of the battery (i.e., how long it lasts):</p>

			<ul>
				<li>General usage of the device</li>

				<li>Wi&#45;Fi usage</li>

				<h3>Charging the Battery</h3>

				<p>It is important to recharge the battery when the low battery indicator appears. The battery can typically

						<p>To Charge the Device Battery</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Using the cable that came with the device, connect the USB cable end to the computer and the other end to

								to is turned on.</li>

							<br />

							<li class="no-bullet">OR</li>
