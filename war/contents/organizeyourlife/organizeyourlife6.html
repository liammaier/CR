			<h1> Chapter 6: The Calendar App</h1>

			<h2>Creating Appointments</h2>

			<p>The steps involved in creating a one-time appointment are pretty straightforward. Appointments are
				called &#8220;events&#8221; in iOS.</p>
			
			<div class="instructions">
				<div class="interior">
					<p>To Create an Appointment</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Tap the Calendar app on the Home screen.</li>
						<li>Tap <img src="/contents/organizeyourlife/images/plus.png"> in the upper right corner of the screen (lower right corner on the iPad).</li>
						<li>Tap each of the Event fields to enter appointment information.</li>
						<li>Tap <img src="/contents/organizeyourlife/images/done.png">  in the upper right corner of the screen.
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<p>Figure 6-1 shows the Add Event screen. Notice that there are several things that you must know about your one-time
				appointment in order to enter it into the Calendar program (e.g., the title of the appointment, the event location,
				the start date and time of the appointment, etc.).</p>

			</div>
			
			<p>To enter information on the Add Event screen, begin with the first block (i.e., Title/Location) and work your way down
				to the last field (i.e., Notes). You may not need to enter information in every field, but you should review the content
				of every field before saving the appointment.</p>
			
			<p>Reviewing the content of every field may seem unnecessary, but the process will help with overall attention to detail
				and sequencing skills.</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Title</strong> &#45; Use the Title field to note the subject of the appointment (e.g., History class).</li>
				<li><strong>Location</strong> &#45; Enter a description of where the appointment will take place (e.g., Office or Room 10
					or even the address of a building).</li>
				<li><strong>Starts/Ends</strong> &#45; These fields hold the starting and ending dates and times for the appointment.</li>
				<li><strong>Time Zone</strong> &#45; This field contains the Time Zone for the event being scheduled.</li>
				<li><strong>Repeat</strong> &#45; The Repeat option is used to schedule recurring appointments. The default value
					&#8220;Never&#8221; should be used for all one-time appointments.</li>
				<li><strong>Invitees</strong> &#45; The Invitees field provides the option to &#8220;invite&#8221; others to the event being
					scheduled. Invitees are typically selected via integration with the Contacts app (discussed in a later chapter).</li>
				<li><strong>Alert</strong> &#45; The Alert field includes several options (to be discussed later).</li>
				<li><strong>Calendar</strong> &#45; The Calendar field allows you to select one of the available calendars.</li>
				<li><strong>Availability</strong> &#45; Select between Busy (default) and Free.</li>
				<li><strong>URL</strong> &#45 The URL field provides space to enter a URL associated with the event, e.g.,  the URL for the
					restaurant you are meeting at for lunch.</li>
				<li><strong>Notes</strong> &#45 The Notes tab is used to add summaries or notes about the specific appointment (e.g., what
					movie you saw, what you did in class that hour, etc.).</li>
			</ol>

				<h2>Making Cognitive Connections 6-1</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>Attention to detail</li>
					<li>Sequencing</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>The most effective way to enter Calendar information is to start at the top of the Add Event screen and enter
					appointment-specific information from the top of the screen moving down to the bottom of the screen. For example,
					appointment Title should be entered first. The Location of the appointment is the second field and should be entered
					next, etc. It is important to pay close attention to the information being requested by the Calendar app and to enter
					the appropriate information.</p>
			</div>
			
<!-- Page 89 -->

			<div class="pagebreak">

			<div class="cognitive-connections">
				<p>The same procedure (working from top to bottom) can be used when filling out paperwork (e.g., college application,
					job application, library card application, surveys, etc.). It is best to review the information being requested and
					then start at the beginning and move through the questions one at a time. There may be certain questions that you don’t
					know the answer to or that don’t apply to you. In this case, you would temporarily skip that question if you don’t know
					the answer or write N/A (not applicable) if the question doesn’t apply to you. Working sequentially through the questions
					will help you verify that you are entering information into each required field. As is suggested with entering appointments
					in the Calendar app, it is a good idea to review each entry before finalizing your responses.</p>
				
				<h3>MCC @ School &amp; Work</h3>
				
				<p>Identify a paperwork situation in your personal life in which using the two cognitive skills referred to above
					(i.e., attention to detail and sequencing) would be beneficial (e.g., opening mail and sequencing bills by due date,
					taking a test at school, completing an application, etc.). Include the steps you currently use to deal with paperwork.</p>

				<h3>Entering Text Using the Keyboard</h3>

				<p>Figure 6-2 shows the Add Event screen. The keyboard displayed at the bottom of the screen is used to enter the
					information into each field. Tap a field to activate it (e.g., Title), then enter the field&#39;s information by
					tapping the desired letters or numbers on the keyboard. The onscreen keyboard works very much like a traditional
					computer keyboard. For instance, to capitalize a single letter, tap the Shift key (<img src="/contents/organizeyourlife/images/shift.png">)
					and then tap the desired letter (e.g., Shift followed by T). </p>

				<p>Figure 6-12 shows the Title/Location box. The Title field should be used to enter a

					enter “meeting” as the title. You might know what “meeting” means when you enter it, 
					but if the appointment doesn’t come up for several weeks, you will be scratching your 
					head wondering, “What meeting?”</p>

				<p>The Location field plays a very important role. Be sure to enter the location of a meeting 
					(e.g., Suite 520, Laguna Hills Office, etc.) so the necessary information is easily available

				<p>It is important to note here that most calendar appointments will start and end on the

				<h3>The Alert Field</h3>

				<p>The Alert function is designed to remind you about upcoming appointments by playing a 
					selected sound. The alert goes off at the designated interval prior to the appointment 
					(e.g., 30 minutes before). In other words, 30 minutes before the scheduled appointment,
					an Alert window will pop up and a sound will beep to indicate that it is 30 minutes until 
					the appointment. The default Alert setting is None. </p>

				<p>It is important to set an alert for appointments; it reminds you of the appointment at a 
					pre-determined interval before the appointment. Think about preparation time, travel 
					time, etc. when setting the appointment alert. For example, I need to account for traffic 
					patterns in Southern California when setting alerts for traveling freeways to 
					appointments. Depending on the time of day I leave my house, I might need to leave 30 
					minutes early or maybe an hour early to get to an appointment; it’s all based on traffic.</p>

				<p>It is unfortunate that the Calendar app doesn’t provide an “other” or “customize” option 
					that would allow you to enter any time frame appropriate for your event, such as 20 
					minutes. You can check on the http://id4theweb.com/appreviews Web site for 
					suggestions of other Calendar apps that include the custom alert feature.</p>

					<p>You will find that the various appointments you schedule will require different alert reminder 
						intervals. For instance, if you are going to a doctor’s appointment and the appointment is 50

					<p>It is not unusual to have to reschedule an appointment after it is created or to edit some aspect of

						rescheduling is very commonplace in everyday life.</p>

						significant role in editing appointment information. It may be important to change one aspect of 
						the appointment, for instance the time and/or date of the appointment, but not other aspects, 
						such as the title. Another example is that you might have to change the location of an 
						appointment, but nothing else.</p>

					<p>In addition, you may find it necessary to completely delete an appointment so that there is no 
						record of it in the Calendar, e.g., a meeting gets cancelled and is not rescheduled.</p>
