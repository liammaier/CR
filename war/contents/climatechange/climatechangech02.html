				Ocean covers roughly 71 percent of Earth’s surface and hosts some of its most productive ecosystems. 
				Sea currents and surface temperature drive weather patterns and create the climate. Evaporation from the 
				sea surface accounts for most of the precipitation that falls on Earth. The ocean’s ability to absorb and 
				store energy allows it to serve as a buffer against extreme climatic swings. And, importantly, the ocean 
				has an enormous capacity to remove carbon dioxide (CO<span class="subscript">2</span>)
				from the atmosphere; researchers estimate 
				that the oceans have absorbed roughly one-third of the anthropogenic carbon released into the air.

				NSF-supported researchers have long sought accurate models of the properties and circulation of

				Heat stored in the ocean warms the atmosphere,

				Ocean currents have the ability to transfer large amounts of heat over

				Ocean currents are considered the engine that 
				drives Earth’s climate because of their capacity 
				to efficiently transport heat over great distances. 
				At the same time, scientists have long suspected 
				that global climate change may radically alter 
				ocean circulation patterns. Now, researchers at the 
				Scripps Institution of Oceanography have analyzed 
				seafloor cores collected by the NSF Ocean Drilling 
				Program (ODP) to provide the first direct evidence 
				of sudden changes in ocean circulation patterns in 
				response to global warming in Earth’s distant past.
			</p>

			<p>
				In a study published in the journal Nature, scientists 
				Flavia Nunes and Richard Norris analyzed carbon 
				trapped in the shells of microscopic, deep-sea fossil 
				organisms called foraminifera to reconstruct past 
				oceanic circulation patterns. Carbon is a good tracer for ocean currents because deepwater masses carry a 
				different carbon signature at formation than they do as they age. Using foraminifera recovered in deep-sea 
				cores from 14 sites in the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Southern Oceans during the ODP (the predecessor 
				to the current Integrated Ocean Drilling Program), the researchers examined the period bracketing a major 
				global warming event that occurred 55 million years ago. The carbon analyses indicate that before and 
				after this period, most deepwater formation occurred in the Southern Hemisphere. At the onset of global 
				warming, though, deepwater formation switched from the Southern to the Northern Hemisphere over a 
				period shorter than 5,000 years—a mere instant in geologic time. The hemispheric reversal in deepwater 
				formation endured for approximately 40,000 years, but another 100,000 or more years was required for 
				reversion to the ocean circulation patterns that predominated before global warming.
			</p>

			<p>
				This study has revealed new details about an important, well-studied ancient global warming event 
				and confirmed that global warming can lead to a rapid hemispheric switch in the locus of oceanic 
				deepwater formation. In light of mounting evidence for contemporary global warming, the study 
				suggests he possibility of future changes in
				ocean circulation. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 12174 GEO/OCE</span>

				Evolution of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Through Plio-Pleistocene Glaciation
			</h1>

			<p>
				A research team at Brown University recently produced the first continuous look at the evolution of sea 
				surface conditions (past temperature and biological productivity) in the climatically sensitive Eastern 
				Equatorial Pacific (EEP) over the past 5 million years. Their study monitored crucial aspects of the 
				modern El Niño region as they evolved over the time when large ice sheets first began to wax and wane 
				in the Northern Hemisphere.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Brown team took advantage of new organic geochemical methods to determine past sea surface 
				temperatures. They extracted alkenones—molecules synthesized by a class of marine algae—from a 
				long deep-sea core recovered by the Ocean Drilling Program just south of the equator in the Eastern 
				Pacific. Quantifying the ratio of two dominant alkenones allowed the investigators to determine past 
				temperatures at the sea surface with high precision. The same sediment core also held clues to past ice 
				ages, in the form of oxygen isotope ratios of bottom-dwelling foraminifera (single-celled organisms 
				that make a carbonate shell). Because the bottom waters of the Pacific ultimately come from the 
				high latitudes of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, comparing the alkenone data (surface 
				conditions) with the benthic isotope data allowed the Brown group to directly compare the response of 
				an important tropical zone to the evolution of the ice ages at high latitudes. A principal finding of the 
				Brown study is that the EEP has cooled rather steadily over the past 5 million years, at a rate of about 1 
				degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) per million years. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 12938 GEO/OCE</span>

				over the period 10,000–20,000 years ago, and

				“Frozen” Natural Gas Discovered at Unexpectedly Shallow Depths Below Seafloor
			</h1>

			<p>
				An international team of research scientists on NSF-funded Integrated Ocean Drilling Program 
				(IODP) Expedition 311 set out to learn how gas hydrates are formed. The science party used the 
				U.S. research drilling vessel <em>JOIDES Resolutionon</em> a 43-day expedition in fall 2005. Gas hydrate, a 
				largely frozen natural gas, is very important because it contains methane, a significant greenhouse 
				gas. Gas hydrate is also a potentially important energy resource. Gas hydrate deposits are typically 
				found below the seafloor in offshore locations where water depths exceed 500 meters (1,600 feet) 
				and in Arctic permafrost regions. Contrary to established expectations of how gas hydrate deposits 
				form, Expedition 311 scientists—led by Michael Riedel of McGill University, Montreal, and Timothy 
				Collett of the United States Geological Survey—found unusually high concentrations of gas hydrate 
				at relatively shallow depths: 50–120 meters (160–400 feet) below the seafloor. The lower pressure 
				stability of gas hydrates means that they may be more accessible for mining, but they are also more 
				easily released from sediments during seafloor landslides triggered by earthquakes, which are common 
				in the geologically active area known as the (northern) Cascadia Margin near the coast of the Pacific 
				Northwest, where the study took place. In addition, because methane is a greenhouse gas that 
				contributes to global warming, and warming oceans may be a prime cause of “melting” of seafloor gas 
				hydrates, there is a potential positive feedback: Warming oceans lead to more methane release, which 
				leads to even more warming. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 13442 GEO/OCE</span>

				Decadal fluctuations in ocean salinity, nutrients, 
				chlorophyll, a variety of zooplankton species, 
				and fish stocks in the Northeast Pacific have 
				been unexplained for many years. They are 
				often poorly correlated with the most widely 
				used indicator of large-scale climate variability 
				in the region: the Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
				(PDO). Researchers Emanuele Di Lorenzo 
				of the Georgia Institute of Technology and 
				Niklas Schneider of the University of Hawaii 
				recently defined a new pattern of climate 
				change—the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation 
				(NPGO)—and showed that its variability is 
				significantly correlated with the previously 
				unexplained fluctuations of salinity, nutrients, 
				and chlorophyll.
			</p>

			<p>
				Fluctuations in the NPGO are driven by the same fundamental processes that control salinity and 
				nutrient concentrations. In the California Current System, the NPGO particularly reflects changes 
				in the winds that cause coastal upwelling, the process by which subsurface cold water that is rich in 
				nutrients is brought up to the surface. These results strongly support the use of the NPGO as the 
				primary indicator of upwelling strength and nutrient fluxes, and, therefore, the potential for ecosystem 
				change in the California Current System region. Changes in nutrient fluxes drive fluctuations in 
				modeled chlorophyll concentration—an indicator of phytoplankton concentration—that are highly 
				correlated to observed chlorophyll. The model simulations support the hypothesis that variations in 
				phytoplankton biomass in the California Current System region are primarily driven by changes in 
				wind-driven upwelling correlated with the NPGO. The NPGO thus provides a strong indicator of 
				changes in the mechanisms driving oceanic ecosystem dynamics. 
			</p>

			<p>
				This “bottom-up” forcing is consistent with previous fish catch data and satellite-derived chlorophyll 
				concentration, and underscores the need to better understand the influences of physically forced 
				nutrient fluxes on higher food-chain levels in the ocean. The researchers have also shown that the 
				NPGO pattern extends beyond the North Pacific and is part of a global mode of climate variability 
				that is evident in global sea-level trends and sea surface temperature. The amplification of the 
				NPGO variability found in observations and in model simulations of global warming scenarios 
				implies that the NPGO may play an increasingly important role in forcing global-scale decadal 
				changes in marine ecosystems. <span class="gretyText">Highlight ID: 16644 GEO/OCE</span>

				Ocean acidification arises as a result of the 
				ocean’s absorption of carbon dioxide (CO
				<span class="subscript">2</span>), 
				followed by a series of naturally occurring 
				equilibrium reactions involving carbonate, 
				bicarbonate, and the hydrogen ion, which 
				together constitute the carbonate cycle. One 
				outcome of these equilibrium reactions is an 
				increase in hydrogen ion concentration (i.e., 
				lower pH) and a decrease in the carbonate 
				ion available for the formation of calcium 
				carbonate. Calcium carbonate is an important 
				skeletal component for many marine organisms, 
				including coral and shell-bearing invertebrates. 
				Undersaturation of oceanic waters with respect 
				to carbonate could promote shell dissolution or 
				inhibit shell formation.
			</p>

			<p>
				The implications for marine organisms, ecosystems, and biogeochemistry of ocean acidification are 
				potentially profound. If shell-bearing species cannot form skeletons or if organisms with shells 
				encounter undersaturated waters, marine biodiversity, food web structure, and biogeochemical 
				function are potentially affected. Non-shell-bearing organisms also may be at risk, because pH 
				influences physiological processes and metabolic reactions in other organisms, as well as
				sorptiondesorption reactions of metals and toxins. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Polar ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification because cold water holds more
				CO<span class="subscript">2</span>;
				therefore, surface waters in the polar oceans are closer to the tipping point of undersaturation. Models 
				predict that the Southern Ocean could become undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a fragile 
				biogenic form of calcium carbonate, by the year 2100. Polar ecosystems include critical members 
				(e.g., pteropods, coccoliths) that depend on calcium carbonate formation for skeletal or protective 
				components. Food web structure and carbon burial may be substantially altered.

			<p>
				Researchers Vicky Fabry of California State University, San Marcos, Brad Seibel of the University 
				of Rhode Island, and Gretchen Hofmann of the University of California-Santa Barbara are taking 
				a multipronged approach to determining the response of Southern Ocean pteropods, an important

				impact of elevated CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				and carbonate-undersaturated seawater on rates of shell formation and sublethal effects on 
				organism energetics. Hofmann is investigating the response of pteropods at the genetic level to 
				calcification stress. Her research on sea urchin larvae shows that shell-forming genes have highly 
				elevated activity and larval skeletons are less developed when the larvae are subjected to undersaturated 
				seawater; this is consistent with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios of ocean 
				conditions in the future. Hofmann is now using gene microarrays to examine the genomic response of

				Before humans influenced the climate system, natural processes 
				controlled atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. One of the great 
				mysteries surrounding Earth’s emergence from the last ice age, which 
				occurred between 19,000 and 11,000 years ago, is the rapid increase in 
				atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				) that occurred as the glacial ice sheets 
				melted. Scientists have known that during this time, the carbon-14 
				(<span class="referenceNumber">14</span>C, an unstable isotope of carbon) content of the atmosphere fell by 
				approximately 35 percent. The current hypothesis for this radiocarbon 
				conundrum—the rapid rise in the level of atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				as the <span class="referenceNumber">14</span>C 
				content of the atmosphere fell—is that a large reservoir of deep ocean 
				water with accumulated CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				suddenly reached the surface and released 
				CO<span class="subscript">2</span>. The stored CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				molecules would have been isolated from the 
				atmosphere for thousands of years (which would decrease its <span class="referenceNumber">14</span>C level), 
				thereby giving CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				in the postglacial atmosphere the appearance of 
				being older (because it contained less <span class="referenceNumber">14</span>C).

				these samples show two periods during

				in contact with old <span class="referenceNumber">14</span> C-depleted

				CO<span class="subscript">2</span>-rich, 
				<span class="referenceNumber">14</span>C-depleted water surfaced along the Baja

				Oceanographers participating in the NSFfunded Eddies Dynamics, Mixing, Export, 
				and Species composition (EDDIES) study 
				have demonstrated that episodic, eddy-driven 
				upwelling—in which ocean surface waters are 
				replaced by water that comes up from below—
				may supply a significant fraction of the nutrients 
				required to sustain primary productivity in the 
				subtropical ocean. The importance of ocean 
				eddies (circular, rotating bodies of ocean water 
				with warm or cold water cores) in stimulating 
				ocean productivity through the enhanced 
				upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water to the 
				surface had been speculated for over a decade. 
				Large areas of the ocean, such as the central 
				subtropical North Atlantic, are characterized by 
				low productivity, largely because phytoplankton 
				growth is limited by the delivery of plant 
				nutrients to the sunlit surface zone. Nevertheless, 
				productivity in these regions is higher than expected based on current knowledge of ocean mixing 
				processes. In 2004 and 2005, EDDIES researchers sampled 10 different ocean eddies in the Northern 
				Atlantic Ocean. Two different types—a “cyclone” eddy (counterclockwise rotating with density surfaces 
				pushed up in the center in a dome shape) and a “mode-water” eddy (clockwise rotating with a thick 
				lens of constant density water below the surface)—were sampled repeatedly. The different types have 
				distinct surface signatures that allow researchers to use remote sensing techniques to locate them, then 
				tag and track them by releasing surface drifters in their core. This sophisticated approach allowed the 
				researchers to sample the eddies and their evolution in great detail over 2 months, tracking them using 
				two research vessels and employing high-tech instrumentation, such as a video plankton recorder, 
				acoustic doppler current profiler, conductivity, temperature, depth recorders, and a tracer that directly 
				measured the horizontal and vertical dispersion of water properties such as temperature, salinity, and 
				plankton concentration.
			</p>

			<p>
				The main result of this study is that the interactions of cyclone and mode-water eddies with the wind 
				result in very different biological responses. The eddy-wind interactions enhance the vertical supply of 
				nutrients in mode-water eddies by moving surface water away from the center of the eddy. The result 
				is sustained primary biological production at the surface and the creation of subsurface maxima in 
				phytoplankton and zooplankton communities. In contrast, the biological production in cyclones is 
				more ephemeral because of a reverse effect of the wind interacting with cyclones. These results explain 
				how higher than expected production can be achieved in mid-ocean regions and points to the need to 
				include explicit representations of eddy-wind interactions and response in future ocean and climate 
				models. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 16578 GEO/OC</span>

				Observation and Prediction (CMOP). The mission of the CMOP is to study coastal margins using 
				observation and prediction technologies to facilitate long-term integrated descriptions and analyses 
				of coastal margin physics, chemistry, and biology. CMOP will enable researchers to focus on novel 
				technological and scientific opportunities to answer major questions about the impact of climate on 
				coastal margins, the role of coastal margins on global elemental cycles, and the seaward extent of human 
				impacts. This work, focused on the Columbia River, will lead to transformative understanding of critical 
				yet vulnerable river-to-ocean ecosystems.

			<p>
				The CMOP partnership is anchored in complementary expertise from Oregon Health and Science 
				University, Oregon State University, and the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington. 
				All three institutions have strong research, education, and outreach assets in the Pacific Northwest. 
				Essential elements of the Science and Technology Center are educational partners and industry partners 
				initially focused on advanced computing and visualization technology, oceanographic instrumentation, 
				and molecular sensors.

			<p>
				Of the many documented effects of global 
				climate change, the bleaching of corals—a 
				stress response caused by elevated seawater 
				temperature in which corals lose their 
				nutrient-providing symbiotic algae (called 
				zooxanthellae)—continues to attract the interest 
				of coral reef biologists around the world. Recent 
				research conducted by Andrea Grottoli from 
				Ohio State University at the Hawaii Institute 
				for Marine Biology has revealed that when 
				certain corals bleach, they can continue to 
				survive by consuming zooplankton from the 
				surrounding seawater.
			</p>

			<p>
				While corals have long been known to consume 
				zooplankton, some species of coral appear to be able to survive bleaching by increasing their rates of 
				feeding to compensate for the loss of food normally supplied by the zooxanthellae when these cells 
				reside safely in their coral host. Grottoli and her group made this discovery by conducting feeding 
				and physiological studies on three species of coral found on reefs in Hawaii. An often-noted effect 
				of coral bleaching is that corals with a mounding shape or morphology are more likely to survive a 
				bleaching event than those with a branching morphology. The study found that one of these species, 
				the branching coral <em>Montipora capitata</em>, exhibited the greatest increase in feeding on zooplankton after 
				bleaching and recovered faster as well, but another branching species, <em>Porites compressa</em>, did not. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The implications of these results are that predicting coral survival or recovery on the basis of 
				morphology does have exceptions, and many species of coral may be able to survive the repeated 
				effects of thermal stress and bleaching by increasing their feeding rates. Increased feeding in the face 
				of continuing environmental stress depends on the availability of zooplankton in the water, which 
				may also be affected by the very same thermal
				stress events that cause corals to bleach. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 13490 GEO/OCE</span>

				Saltier Tropical Oceans and Fresher Ocean Waters Near the Poles: More Signs of Global Climate Change
			</h1>

			<p>
				Tropical ocean waters have become dramatically saltier over the past 40 years, while oceans closer 
				to Earth’s poles have become fresher. These large-scale, relatively rapid oceanic changes suggest that 
				recent climate changes, including global warming, may be altering the fundamental planetary system 
				that regulates evaporation and precipitation and cycles freshwater around the globe. The study, led by 
				Ruth Curry of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), provides direct evidence that 
				the global water cycle is intensifying. This result is consistent with global warming hypotheses that 
				suggest ocean evaporation will increase as Earth’s temperature does. By comparing recent and historical 
				salinity observations, the investigators observed that surface waters in tropical and subtropical Atlantic 
				Ocean regions have become markedly saltier. Simultaneously, much of the water column in the high 
				latitudes of the North and South Atlantic became fresher. This trend appears to have accelerated in the 
				years since 1990, when 10 of the warmest years occurred since records began in 1861. The scientists 
				estimated that net evaporation rates over the tropical Atlantic have increased by 5 percent to 10 percent 
				over the past four decades. These findings are particularly significant as pressure on freshwater resources 
				has become critical in many areas around the world. An acceleration of Earth’s global water cycle can 
				potentially affect global precipitation patterns that govern the distribution, severity, and frequency of 
				droughts, floods, and storms. It would also exacerbate global warming by rapidly adding more water 
				vapor—itself a potent, heat-trapping greenhouse gas—to the atmosphere. And it could continue to 
				freshen North Atlantic Ocean waters to a point that could disrupt ocean circulation and trigger further 
				climate changes. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 8053/ Press Release 03-145 GEO/OCE</span>
