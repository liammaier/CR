				The last piece of the climate puzzle is perhaps the most complicated and dynamic of all: people. The 
				overwhelming majority of climate researchers have reached the understanding—based on decades of 
				evidence, modeling, and debate—that it is extremely likely<span class="referenceNumber">1</span>
				that human activities are responsible for 
				rising temperatures on Earth. Human behavior will continue to be a major factor in climate change 
				research, and understanding the feedbacks between human behavior
				and climate variability is critical.<span class="referenceNumber">2</span>
				Humans can adopt social and commercial practices and implement government policies and laws 
				that significantly affect greenhouse gas emissions. We can increase our energy efficiency and invent 
				alternative fuel sources for our energy-intensive activities. And human ingenuity might even provide 
				geoengineering technologies capable of reversing some of the effects of anthropogenic climate change.

				NSF supports research in all non-health-related human sciences. Some academic fields, such as 
				sociology, rely almost exclusively on NSF for government research funding in the United States. 
				Overall, NSF provides approximately 61 percent of federal support for basic research in the social 
				sciences at U.S. academic institutions.<span class="referenceNumber">3</span>
				NSF’s tradition in the social, behavioral, and economic 
				sciences has emerged as a key strength for climate change research. Not only must human systems be 
				factored into climate projections, but an understanding of human science provides the entire research 
				community with the opportunity to learn how to effectively communicate research findings to society. 
				At NSF, we see the transformative research of the future emerging at the boundaries between the 
				traditional scientific and engineering disciplines, and climate change is no exception. Some of the 
				most compelling and paradigm-changing research results have come from multidisciplinary teams that 
				include the human science aspect.

				In addition to supporting the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, NSF addresses the human aspect 
				of climate change through education. NSF research grants to academic institutions not only provide 
				funds for research equipment, overhead costs, and infrastructure, they also enable principal investigators 
				(PIs) to offer financial support to undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers 
				training to become the next generation of scientists and engineers dedicated to studying climate change 
				and addressing its impacts. NSF PIs frequently share their time and resources through educational 
				outreach activities involving undergraduate and K–12 students, and members of the community at large. 
				These outreach activities, along with NSF-supported formal and informal education programs (including 
				classroom materials, television programs, and Web sites), engage and educate students and members of 
				the public about scientific and technological issues, including climate change.
			</p>

			<p>
				Engineering and the physical sciences hold the potential to provide breakthrough technologies in energy, 
				transportation, construction, and other human endeavors that affect the climate. Progress in these hard 
				sciences influences human-factors research as we strive to understand the emergence, dissemination, and 
				adoption of new knowledge and advanced technologies. These tools have the potential to help us adapt 
				to climate change, as well as reduce—and perhaps one day reverse—anthropomorphic greenhouse gas 
				accumulation in the atmosphere.

				Modeling Human Behavior
			</h1>

			<p>
				Human behavior may be the most mercurial of 
				all the variables confronting climate modelers. 
				While other parameters follow the laws of 
				physics, human behavior depends on social 
				norms and values, economic forces, technological 
				advances, government policies, and other factors 
				that are all but impossible to account for in 
				physical models. In the latest Intergovernmental 
				Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, human 
				behavior was factored into future projections 
				by assuming different levels of greenhouse gas 
				emissions. These scenarios depend on varying 
				levels of economic growth, the adoption 
				of various energy-efficient practices and 
				technologies, and more or less stringent cultural 
				and government influences on energy systems. 
				The integrated climate models of the future will 
				need to account for the critical human factor, 
				including the behavior of groups of humans. 
				Humans may represent the most complex and 
				dynamic of systems to model. Computational 
				models will allow us to begin to understand the 
				phenomena of emergent behavior and tipping 
				points in human interactions.
			</p>

			<p>
				Computer science and engineering continue to 
				have a profound impact on humanity’s ability to 
				track and predict climate change and to manage 
				our response to it. Advances in computational 
				tools must involve advances in the human 
				interface. Computational methods provide 
				visualization tools that help people process and 
				handle complex information. One example of an advanced visualization tool is the Highly Interactive 
				Parallelized Display Wall (HIPerWall) project, a facility aimed at advancing Earth science modeling 
				and visualization. HIPerWall is being used to analyze IPCC data sets.<span class="referenceNumber">4</span>
				Other human interface advances 
				will come in the form of intelligent software that makes results accessible and useful to policymakers, 
				and networking tools to promote collaboration among research groups around the world.

				Decisionmaking
			</h1>

			<p>
				In the complex, multifaceted area of climate change, uncertainties abound. Climate modeling attempts to 
				take into account every variable researchers can quantify, but there will always be unknowns. Given that 
				the uncertainties in the projections of future temperature, precipitation patterns, species adaptation, and 
				many other variables cannot be fully resolved; and 
				given that government officials, business owners, 
				and the public at large will have to make decisions 
				on the basis of uncertain science, NSF funds three 
				Decision Making Under Uncertainty (DMUU) 
				Centers and two interdisciplinary research teams 
				to tackle these issues.

				The Decision Center for a Desert City (DCDC) 
				at Arizona State University uses nearby Phoenix 
				as a laboratory for studying adaptation strategies, 
				especially those related to water management 
				in an arid climate. The city’s past successes in 
				managing its water supply are being challenged by 
				current drought conditions. A multidisciplinary 
				team of researchers and local water managers 
				are confronting the question of whether this 
				desert city has enough water to sustain growth, given that many climate models predict that the western 
				United States will be warmer and drier in future decades.6
				DCDC has led to the development of practical 
				computational models used by decisionmakers in the Phoenix area, and the center will serve as a model 
				for other Western cities facing similar water problems as a result of the changing climate.
			</p>

			<p>
				At Carnegie Mellon University’s Climate Decision Making Center, researchers focus on how to deal with 
				“irreducible uncertainties”—the limits of our understanding of climate change and its impacts. The center 
				has developed methods for policymakers to rank ecological risks, incorporating the informed judgments 
				of ordinary citizens along with input from experts. This combined approach to risk analysis can be used as 
				a model for other risk-management decisions.<span class="referenceNumber">7</span>

				At Columbia University, the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions (CRED) studies individual 
				and group decisionmaking under climate uncertainty. CRED seeks to improve risk communication and 
				increase the use of scientific information on climate variability and change.<span class="referenceNumber">8</span>

				Two research teams were also funded under the first DMUU solicitation. The University of Colorado

			<p>
				NSF has a long history of supporting research on disaster warning systems. Disaster warning systems can 
				help protect human life during an extreme event such as a hurricane. Increasing sea surface temperatures 
				mean a likely increase in the intensity of 
				hurricanes, because warm water has more energy 
				to contribute to storms. Climate change will also 
				raise global sea level, which will also increase the 
				potential danger of hurricanes, because low-lying 
				areas will be more susceptible to inundation from 
				storm surges. With these increased risks, clear 
				disaster communication between government 
				officials and the public is essential. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, NSF 
				sponsored several research teams to study not 
				only the failure of the levee system, but also the 
				human and social aspects of the storm, including 
				the vulnerability of the poor, the public health 
				impacts, and how socioeconomic factors 
				correlated with evacuation planning and decisions.<span class="referenceNumber">11</span>
				These studies provided vital information about 
				how disaster planning and response can be more effective during future natural disasters, including 
				wildfires. Wildfires are expected to increase in frequency as changing weather patterns lead to drier 
				conditions throughout much of the American West.<span class="referenceNumber">12</span>

				Anthropogenic climate change is one of the most significant and large-scale examples of the coupling 
				of human and natural systems. We know that human behavior is a powerful force of change at the 
				local, regional, and global scale. At all scales, human behavior both causes environmental change and 
				responds to it. The interactions between humans and ecosystems—especially the dynamics of these 
				interactions—are expected to change as the 
				effects of global climate change are increasingly 
				seen in local ecosystems. For example, changes in 
				precipitation patterns will lead to changes in the 
				availability of freshwater for municipal drinking 
				supplies, which will have an influence on patterns 
				of urban growth. To gain a greater understanding 
				of these issues, NSF created a formal, crossdirectorate multidisciplinary program to support 
				teams of researchers focused on the social, 
				natural, and physical science behind the coupling 
				of human and natural systems.<span class="referenceNumber">13</span>
				Examples of

				Arctic Social Sciences
			</h1>

			<p>
				Earth’s Arctic region has experienced more significant climate change than perhaps any other area 
				on Earth. The intact native cultures spread around the Arctic Circle present a unique opportunity 
				for social scientists to study and document cultures in flux. Many indigenous people depend 
				on hunting the native species of the Arctic, not only for food, but also as the basis for cultural 
				identity. More unpredictable weather and diminishing sea ice are reducing access to cultural 
				hunting grounds.<span class="referenceNumber">15</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				With their cultural sensitivity to changing environmental conditions, native people may see 
				patterns and changes that researchers might miss. To capture native knowledge and involve native 
				people in the study of their own environment, NSF-funded researchers have enlisted the input of 
				native people in environmental observation, while at the same time helping the people document 
				and preserve their cultural heritage for future generations. The knowledge and observations passed 
				on to indigenous people from their ancestors provide researchers with an invaluable source of 
				information about climate change.

					Developing Ocean Literacy
				</h1>

				<p>
					The often-devastating consequences of global climate change, ocean 
					acidification, and the collapse of commercial fisheries illustrate 
					the powerful role that ocean processes play in shaping the human 
					condition. Preventing or mitigating these consequences requires that 
					ocean scientists, educators, and policymakers work together so that

				</p>

				<p>
					NSF’s Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence have 
					been instrumental in promoting the development of ocean literacy 
					concepts on a national scale. In June 2006, NSF co-sponsored the 
					Conference on Ocean Literacy, which brought together representatives 
					from federal agencies, experts in formal and informal education, 
					nongovernmental organizations, and industry representatives to lay 
					the groundwork for developing a national strategy for an ocean-literate 
					society. The recommendations from the conference include revamping curricular standards; improving links 
					among research communities, educators, and government agencies; and fostering regional and national 
					networks. The collective recommendations represent a major advance in meeting the challenge of increasing 
					public understanding of ocean processes.<span class="referenceNumber">20</span>

				NSF-funded engineers are rethinking everything 
				from how computer chips are powered<span class="referenceNumber">21</span>
				to how 
				new buildings are constructed to find new ways 
				to make human activities more energy-efficient, 
				thus reducing carbon emissions. For example, 
				researchers are developing a thin-film technology 
				that adheres both solar cells and heat pumps 
				onto surfaces, ultimately turning a building’s 
				walls and windows into a climate-control system 
				that harvests the Sun’s energy to heat and cool.

				Conclusion
			</h1>

			<p>
				The human contribution to global climate change is nearly indisputable. But so, too, is the human 
				ability to innovate and to change course. NSF funds research in the many aspects of “people science,” 
				from social, behavioral, and economic science to high-tech physical science and engineering. The 
				common link is research relating in one way or another to people and their behavior. None of the 
				climate change research funded by NSF, or by any organization, would be meaningful without human 
				beings to learn from it and apply the knowledge to some endeavor, such as building a better climate 
				model, planning a strategy to save a species or ecosystem, creating a law to cap carbon emissions, or 
				designing a new set of experiments to address the next unanswered question. The research highlights 
				that follow describe a variety of research projects aimed at the human aspect of climate change. Social, 
				behavioral, and economic science; education; and green technologies are some of the featured research 
				areas. These research projects have not only contributed to our understanding of the role of people in 
				climate change, they have also provided learning opportunities for the students who will become the 
				next generation of scientists and engineers.

				The Decision Center for a Desert City (DCDC) 
				at Arizona State University focuses on waterrelated decisionmaking in the arid Phoenix 
				metropolitan area. A transdisciplinary team of 
				scientists led by Patricia Gober and local water 
				managers is confronting the pertinent question 
				of whether this desert city has enough water to 
				sustain growth, given that the western United 
				States is expected to be warmer and drier in 
				future decades. Center researchers have built a 
				new model of science and policy engagement 
				that allows water managers and scientists to 
				collaborate on important research questions and 
				experiment with new methods, visualizations, and decision tools so that policymakers can make better 
				decisions for their cities, states, and regions.
			</p>

			<p>
				DCDC’s signature product, WaterSim, integrates a number of quantitative models that represent 
				water consumption and availability in central Arizona under varying scenarios of population growth, 
				climate change, individual behavior, and policy choices. WaterSim links the results of the center’s 
				research projects into an interactive tool that allows users to explore the landscape of plausible 
				futures and consider the strategies for avoiding unacceptable scenarios. DCDC’s knowledge, tools, 
				and visualizations are jointly produced, as scientists mine new insights for model development and 
				water managers ensure that the model itself is consistent with the decision context in which it will 
				be used. Model results support scenario planning at the municipal level, highlight the need for water 
				conservation, and demand management at the regional level to avoid the deleterious consequences of 
				worst-case climate change conditions.
			</p>

			<p>
				WaterSim currently characterizes only the metro Phoenix water situation. Once refined, the model’s 
				methods will be transferable to cities around the globe. Beyond the obvious application to regional 
				water supplies in other cities challenged by the uncertainties of climate change and growth, this 
				approach also can be used to support decisions about entire river basins or watersheds. Center 
				researchers plan to integrate regional data to properly assess the vulnerabilities in the water supply from 
				the Lower Colorado River Basin, with Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and Tucson as the potential partners. 
				WaterSim is available to the general public on the Web (<a href="http://watersim.asu.edu">http://watersim.asu.edu</a>). Local high schools 
				are testing WaterSim with an eye toward linking new scientific knowledge and student learning, with 
				societal needs and policy choices. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 16008 SBE/SES</span>

				Science Policy Assessment and Research on Climate for Decisionmaking Under Uncertainty
			</h1>

			<p>
				Scientists have warned that the costs of future disasters likely will increase because of more frequent 
				and intense extreme events, such as storms and floods. Disaster losses also are expected to increase over 
				time because more people, property and wealth will occupy locations exposed to extreme events. The 
				destructive potential for hurricanes in Miami Beach, for example, is much greater because of dramatic 
				increases in development over recent decades.
			</p>

			<p>
				Working together on the Science Policy Assessment and Research on Climate (SPARC) project, Roger 
				Pielke, Jr. of the University of Colorado-Boulder and Daniel Sarewitz of Arizona State University have 
				sought to quantify the sensitivity of future losses to possible changes in climate and possible patterns 
				of future development. They have identified the factors that are likely to be most responsible for future 
				costs of disasters across a wide range of climate change scenarios so decisionmakers can identify policy 
				actions robust to uncertainties.
			</p>

			<p>
				Pielke and Sarewitz found that the most important factors contributing to the growing costs of 
				disasters through 2050 are patterns of development under any climate change scenario. In one scenario 
				examining possible hurricane damage, they concluded that for every dollar in damages in 2000, $4.60 
				in damages would be expected in 2050. Half of this $3.60 increase would be due to development, 
				while only one-sixth would be directly related to changes in climate. The overwhelming importance of 
				societal change in driving future losses is robust across all scenarios of climate change, development, 
				and damage projections. In other scenarios, the role of development is much greater.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because any changes to energy policies resulting in lower emissions of greenhouse gases will take 
				many decades to have a discernible effect on the climate system, and because the exact relationship of 
				greenhouse gases and patterns of extreme events remains uncertain and contested, these findings mean 
				that decisionmakers have considerable ability to influence the nature of future economic losses from 
				disasters by influencing development patterns in regions exposed to extreme events. Thus, efforts to 
				reduce the growing rate of disaster losses around the world can proceed while scientific research continues 
				to reduce uncertainty about the pace and
				magnitude of climate change. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 16006 SBE/SES</span>

				An NSF-funded researcher has investigated the

			</p>

			<p>
				Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) is recognized 
				as one of the most effective power reduction

				As part of this research project, the principal investigator developed a compiler-supported DVS

				were based on physical power and energy measurements. On a high-performance AMD laptop 
				(Compaq Presario), total system energy savings of up to 28 percent were achieved with a performance

				HIPerWall: Development of a High-Performance Visualization System for Collaborative Earth System Sciences
			</h1>

			<p>
				The Highly Interactive Parallelized Display Wall (HIPerWall) project provides unprecedented
				highcapacity visualization capabilities to experimental and theoretical researchers.The primary focus is on 
				Earth science visualization, but collaborating researchers in fields including biomedical science and 
				engineering also benefit from HIPerWall’s capabilities. Earth science data sets often cover large areas of 
				the planet at high resolution and depth, with many values at each grid point that vary over time, resulting 
				in many gigabytes or terabytes of data. Visualizing these multidimensional, time-varying data sets is a 
				challenge to computational/storage infrastructure and current display technologies. With HIPerWall, 
				researchers can see the broad view of the data and details concurrently, enabling collaboration and shared 
				viewing of complex results. A visualization cluster of high-performance commodity computers transfers 
				and manipulates data displayed on HIPerWall’s 50 display tiles, which operate at a combined resolution 
				of more than 200 megapixels. The visualization cluster receives simulation data from the University 
				of California-Irvine’s (UCI’s) Earth System Modeling Facility, an IBM supercomputer (funded by 
				NSF in 2003); connects to UCI’s digital workspace of the future project, VizClass (funded by NSF in 
				2001); and communicates over the Calit2 OptIPuter network (funded by NSF in 2003). HIPerWall’s 
				ability to display extremely high-resolution data sets drives and provides focus for ongoing research into 
				management, transfer, and visualization of terabyte-scale data, establishing a cyberinfrastructure test bed.
			</p>

			<p>
				Visual Analytics’ HIPerWall supports simultaneous display of raw, processed, and fused data. For 
				example, 20 simulation runs performed by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are 
				currently being analyzed on HIPerWall, allowing climate predictions, which differ in resolution, to be

				visually correlated by teams of Earth System Science researchers. By discovering climate effects that are 
				evident across most or all of the models, scientists can reach consensus. Without the massive resolution 
				of HIPerWall, correlating such changes would have to be accomplished by converting all the results into 
				a common-size data format and attempting machine correlation. Because the human eye is so efficient at 
				pattern recognition, humans can do such discovery more easily when presented with the data in a clear 
				manner. By enabling scientists to see predicted changes in multiple models with their own eyes, and 
				drawing from their specific domain expertise, it is more likely that consensus can be reached.
			</p>

			<p>
				The software tool to display the IPCC data on HIPerWall is a direct result of the availability of the 
				massive display and computation resources provided by HIPerWall. The tool reads NetCDF result 
				files generated by the participating institutions and displays the parameter, such as 2-D temperature 
				and rainfall variables, geo-referenced on an Earth map image. For example, time-varying temperature 
				and rainfall data can be displayed simultaneously for each model with 50-year separation between 
				them and correlated with the difference in the temperature and rainfall maps from the corresponding 
				month of the start year, 2000. The tool can step forward or backward through time,
				month-by-month, from 2000 to 2099, with simultaneous updates to the eight results displays for all 20 data 
				sets. This enormous amount of data is presented in a clear and concise manner that makes visual 
				correlation of features possible and easy. Data are provided in the context of a virtual desktop and can 
				be moved freely to any of HIPerWall’s display tiles, allowing researchers to organize (cluster) relevant 
				information. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Even though HIPerWall is still being developed, it already allows researchers from different disciplines 
				to come together to work on information visualization problems that were previously elusive. The core 
				research team now consists of 15 faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate and undergraduate 
				students who collaborate with groups in six departments and four schools at the University of 
				California-Irvine and the University of California-San Diego on problems in Earth system science, 
				remote observation, sensor networks and sensor fusion, emergency assessment and response, 
				bioinformatics, and distributed computing

				Current control and protection of wind

				This is because wind farms, fuel cells, and

				Missouri-Rolla, led by Badrul Chowdhury, 
				are developing new technologies and control 
				strategies to improve the power electronics 
				interface required to integrate DERs, 
				including renewables, into the power grid. 
				Use of energy storage devices such as superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) or fuel 
				cells can provide higher flexibility to allow DERs to remain online during a disturbance.

				As part of the effort, the researchers have developed a control strategy for switching signals of 
				a three-phase inverter using a decoupled active/reactive power control scheme. In studying the 
				response time of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system to disturbances, simulation results have 
				shown that the response time is improved by 50 percent with the DC/DC converter connected 
				to an SOFC. The response time is further improved by an additional 45–48 percent (i.e., 
				95–98 percent overall) with the three-phase inverter connected to the SOFC-DC/DC system.

				expensive enterprise. After CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				removal, certain gases have many commercial uses. For example, 
				CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				is removed during hydrogen and ammonia production and in natural gas purification. 
				The current commercial process for the removal of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				from gases involves cumbersome, large-size 
				manufacturing gas plant operations using aqueous amine solutions. This expensive, capital- and 
				energy-intensive process includes the pumping of vast amounts of both loaded and regenerated amine 
				solutions, the consumption of great amounts of energy in heating the loaded amine solution via steam 
				for solution regeneration, and the use of expensive equipment to process the solutions. Furthermore, 
				the thermodynamic equilibrium limits the solubility of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				in the amine solution, which increases the 
				size of the absorber, regenerator, and associated equipment (i.e., a bigger gas plant). 
			</p>

			<p>
				In view of the deficiencies of current gas plants, the Ho Group at Ohio State University is researching 
				and developing an effective process with both capital and energy savings. The Ho Group uses a novel 
				approach through a CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				-selective membrane. This new approach combines the absorption and 
				stripping of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				—which is carried out in two separate steps in the commercial technology—into 
				a one-step membrane process. This one-step process not only simplifies the separation process, but 
				eliminates the expensive equipment used in the commercial technology and results in a smaller 
				environmental footprint. The one-step process also overcomes the thermodynamic solubility limit of 
				aqueous amine solution. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The Ho Group’s research uses a novel CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				-selective membrane approach to overcome many of the 
				deficiencies of the commercial gas-treating technology. This membrane approach will have both 
				significant capital and energy savings. The membranes have many potential applications, including the 
				purification of synthesis gas to produce high-purity hydrogen for fuel cells, CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				capture from flue gas 
				for its sequestration, and CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				removal from biogas, natural gas, confined space air, and ambient air.

				The convergence of advances in molecular biology, nanoscience, microbiology, imaging and 
				visualization techniques, and engineering simulation offers an enormous opportunity for geotechnical 
				engineers, together with bio-geo scientists, to provide society with solutions to problems created by 
				rapid global and regional change. These solutions include sustainable approaches to the regeneration 
				of cities, carbon sequestration, rehabilitation of infrastructure, cleanup of brownfields, disposal of 
				hazardous waste, protection of water resources, and maintenance of ecosystems for food. Solutions 
				to these challenges require interdisciplinary research at the interfaces between traditional science and 
				engineering disciplines, including geotechnical engineering, geosciences, microbiology, geochemistry, 
				molecular biology, soil science, and geoenvironmental engineering.
			</p>

			<p>
				Exploration of this emerging interdisciplinary field occurred in April 2007 at an international 
				workshop jointly funded by NSF and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of the 
				United Kingdom. Interdisciplinary teams identified applications by considering Earth’s subsurface 
				as a living open reactor system whose mechanical, biological, and chemical processes are dynamic 
				and changing. The applications were broadly categorized into the areas of mechanical control of the 
				subsurface, hydraulic control of the subsurface, remediation and waste treatment, energy production 
				and carbon sequestration, and soil-plant interactions. Among the applications identified were microbes 
				cementing loose sand to prevent building collapse during earthquakes; biological and chemical

				A project currently under way in the Cariaco 
				Basin of the tropical North Atlantic has 
				produced some interesting results regarding 
				past climate change and its implications. 
				Sediment cores from the Cariaco Basin provide 
				an excellent record of climate change, down to 
				the annual scale, through the use of proxies. 
				These records have been compared with records 
				from Greenland ice cores to determine whether 
				climate change is consistent throughout the low 
				and high latitudes. The Cariaco records show 
				climate shifts analogous to those indicated by the 
				ice core records, including the Younger Dryas 
				cooling event of the North Atlantic. Overall, 
				there is an excellent correlation between the Cariaco and Greenland records, indicating that abrupt 
				climate shifts first identified in Greenland were experienced in the tropics as well. However, there are 
				also differences that may provide clues to the nature of climate forcing. For example, iron and titanium 
				concentrations in the sediment samples are being used as a proxy for changes in regional precipitation 
				and hydrology over northern South America. The results to date suggest that these changes are not 
				clearly linked to high-latitude temperature but are instead responses to the forcing caused by Earth’s 
				rotational precession that dominates solar radiation at low latitudes.
