				Earth’s landmasses support critical ecosystems, host Earth’s freshwater 
				environments, and sustain almost all human agricultural activities. Land 
				separates freshwater from the sea, stores nutrients essential for terrestrial and 
				aquatic life, and holds a fossil record of Earth’s climatic past. As the planet 
				warms, the conditions favorable to many plant and animal species are expected 
				to shift toward the poles. Individual species will differ in their ability to make 
				the same shifts. The resulting altered species distributions will likely cause 
				significant disruptions to established ecosystems, as habitats adjust to new 
				species populations.<span class="referenceNumber">1</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				Land use is inextricably linked to the carbon cycle. Changing land-use 
				patterns, such as clearing forest to create agricultural plots, change the 
				dynamics of the carbon cycle. Livestock such as cattle contribute a net 
				surplus of carbon to the atmosphere in the form of methane, a powerful 
				greenhouse gas. 
			</p>

			<p>
				NSF-supported researchers study all aspects of the land-climate connection. 
				Through observational networks, researchers gather vital data about critical 
				ecosystems, the hydrological cycle, the timing of seasonal events (such as 
				wildflower blooms), and other critical indicators of land-based ecosystem 
				health. NSF also supports geologists in the field who uncover records of past 
				conditions, such as flood histories of river valleys and coastal plains or the 
				fossils of ancient plant and animal species. Through such records, geologists 
				open a window into Earth’s history and learn how the land responded to past 
				climate change events.

			<h1>
				Sea Level
			</h1>

			<p>
				The volume of the ocean depends on its temperature (an increase in temperature causes water to 
				expand) and the amount of liquid water on Earth. Warming resulting from the greenhouse effect 
				causes sea-level rise because of thermal expansion and melting of land-based ice pack. Melting sea ice 
				does not change sea level, because floating ice displaces the same volume of water that it contains. 
				Sea level is particularly relevant to land-based life and the people living near land’s end. From 1961 to 
				2003, the average rate of global mean sea-level rise is estimated to be about
				1.8 millimeters per year.<span class="referenceNumber">2</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				By looking at the geological record of past sea level and comparing that record to tree ring data and 
				ice and sediment cores, researchers are learning what events trigger changes in global sea level. In one 
				NSF-funded study, geologists found that in the last 100 million years, sea-level changes have been 
				dominated by growth and melting of continental ice (glaciers).<span class="referenceNumber">3</span>

				Climate Change in the Geological Record

			<p>
				The fossil record contains evidence of how Earth responded to past climate changes. The locations 
				of fossils show where particular species were found during what era, giving scientists an idea of how 
				modern species might adapt to present-day global warming. NSF-funded researchers have uncovered 
				evidence of rapid changes in the geographic distribution of plant species in response to past periods of 
				rapid global warming. Fossil evidence reveals patterns of intra- and intercontinental migration of both 
				plants and animals during the Palocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, one of Earth’s most significant 
				periods of climate change, which occurred 55 million years ago.<span class="referenceNumber">4</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				The fossilized leaves of plants from previous periods of global warming discovered in Wyoming 
				suggest that insect damage to plants increases with rising temperature, which researchers attribute 
				to the northward migration of voracious tropical insect species. This past migratory pattern provides 
				important evidence about the behavior of insects during climate warming, which could have important 
				implications for modern-day agricultural crops and ecosystems.<span class="referenceNumber">5</span>

				Freshwater

				Earth’s landmasses host the vast majority of the world’s freshwater, most of which is locked away in the

				Warming temperatures cause glacial water reserves to melt, precipitation patterns to change, and water

				To better understand land’s “critical zone”—the region between the

			<p>
				Earth’s landmasses host some of the planet’s most important habitats, including our own. Researchers 
				are working to understand how global climate change will affect land-based precipitation patterns and 
				ecosystems, particularly in areas where water is already scarce and in areas of high human population 
				density. Land-based climate records, such as those found in freshwater pond and lake sediments and in 
				caves, give researchers information about how climate has changed at different locations over the ages. 
				The land also contains information about sea levels during past periods of global warming; these data 
				points can help climate modelers create more accurate projections of future sea levels. The following 
				research highlights describe some of the many projects funded by NSF on land research. This research 
				not only contributes to our understanding of Earth’s past and present climate, it also provides the 
				opportunity for the next generation of paleoclimatologists, ecologists, and climate modelers to gain 
				valuable hands-on training.

			<h1>
				Global Sea-Level Changes in the Last 500 Million Years
			</h1>

			<p>
				Changes in global sea level can be a consequence of changes in the volume of water in the ocean or 
				changes in the volume of the ocean basins themselves. Changes in seawater volume are primarily 
				caused by a change in water temperature or the growth or melting of glaciers. Changes in volume of 
				ocean basins are caused by changes in the amount of sediments carried to the oceans and underwater 
				volcanic activity.
			</p>

			<p>
				Recently, researchers from Rutgers University reviewed global sea-level changes from the past 543 
				million years using oxygen isotopes, a sensitive indicator of temperature, and ice volume changes. They 
				found that the highest sea level (about 100 ± 50 meters above present sea level) was during the Late 
				Cretaceous, between 80 and 65 million years ago. The scientists also concluded that in the past 100 
				million years, sea-level changes were dominated by growth and melting of continental ice (glaciers).

			<p>
				Scientists have found that a period of rapid global warming 55 
				million years ago, called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum 
				(PETM), caused major changes in where plants grew. The PETM 
				was caused by a massive release of carbon into the atmosphere 
				and ocean, making it an analog for the global warming that is 
				expected as humans continue to add carbon dioxide (CO<span class="subScript">2</span>) to the 
				atmosphere, primarily by burning fossil fuels. The PETM raised 
				global temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees 
				Fahrenheit). Plant fossils dating to the PETM in Wyoming are 
				the same as plant fossils that have long been known from rocks of 
				similar age in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. These southern 
				plants spread from the Gulf Coast to Wyoming, a distance of some 
				1,000 miles, within 10,000 years or less. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The southern plants grew throughout the PETM in Wyoming, then disappeared, presumably unable 
				to survive there as the global climate cooled at the end of the event. The return to a cooler climate 
				brought a different set of plant invaders to Wyoming. Relatives of linden and wingnut emigrated from 
				Europe to North America across Arctic land bridges during periods of peak warmth, then established 
				themselves in Wyoming forests after the global heat wave had passed. A similar pattern of intra- and 
				intercontinental migration can be found in animals that lived during the PETM, suggesting that they, 
				too, moved in concert with rapid climate change. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Scott Wing, of the Department of Paleobiology at the Smithsonian Institution, led an international 
				team of researchers in a study of fossilized leaves and pollen found in the Bighorn Basin of 
				northwestern Wyoming. The Bighorn Basin is a well-known treasure trove for fossils because 
				enormous amounts of sediment were deposited there as the Rocky Mountains rose. These sediments 
				and the fossils they contain are now exposed in spectacularly eroded badlands. Fossilized mammals 
				and chemical analysis of rocks were key in determining the age of the leaf fossils, which are the first 
				discovered from the PETM period. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 11451 GEO/EAR</span>

				A sudden global warming 55 million years ago, 
				called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum 
				(PETM), was caused by a massive release of 
				carbon into the atmosphere and oceans, making 
				it an analog for the global warming that is 
				expected as humans add carbon dioxide (CO<span class="subScript">2</span>) to 
				the atmosphere. The PETM event raised global 
				temperatures as much as 10 degrees Celsius (18 
				degrees Fahrenheit). Previous research linked 
				the PETM with mass extinctions of bottomdwelling marine organisms and the migration of 
				mammals across Arctic land bridges. The plants 
				alive during that time have also indicated a fastchanging climate, allowing southern-dwelling 
				trees and shrubs to move north in a hurry. 
			</p>

			<p>
				New results of a study by a team of researchers from Pennsylvania State University, the Smithsonian 
				Institution, the University of Maryland, the University of California-Santa Barbara, and Wesleyan 
				University indicate a link between temperature and insect feeding on leaves. Study researcher Ellen 
				Currano of Penn State and the Smithsonian Institution, says, “When temperature increases, the 
				diversity of insect feeding damage on plant species also increases.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Currano collected the study fossils from the badlands of Wyoming, gathering leaves from five sites 
				representing time zones before, during, and after the roughly 100,000-year temperature spike called 
				the PETM. Researchers found that the PETM plants were noticeably more damaged than fossil plants 
				before and after that period. The PETM plants, many of which are legumes (the family that now 
				includes beans and peas), show damage with greater frequency, greater variety, and a more destructive 
				character than plants from the surrounding geologic time periods.
			</p>

			<p>
				Biologists are already aware that insects in the tropics consume more plants and that warming temperatures 
				are causing organisms to widen their ranges. In addition, research has shown that plants grown under higher 
				concentrations of CO<span class="subScript">2</span> 
				are less nutritious, so insects must eat more plant tissue to get the same sustenance. 
				These earlier studies support the recent findings about the PETM. Because food webs
				that involve planteating insects affect as much as three-quarters of organisms on Earth,
				the researchers believe that the current 
				increase in temperature could have a profound impact on present ecosystems, and potentially on crops, if the 
				pattern holds true in modern times. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 16576 GEO/EAR</span>

				Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network Expands Partnerships in the United 
				States and Abroad to Advance the Scale of Lake Research
			</h1>

			<p>
				An international collaboration called GLEON (Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network) is 
				advancing ecological understanding of the role of lakes in the global carbon balance and helping 
				researchers understand lake metabolism and lake response to dramatic weather events, such as 
				hurricanes. With funding from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), a group of 
				researchers from the United States is collaborating with international scientists to form a network 
				of sensors deployed on lakes to gather data on lake metabolism and nutrient cycling. Data from this 
				international observatory will provide information on key lake processes and functions that are affected 
				by climate and land-use changes, and will develop processes that will be useful in developing NEON.
			</p>

			<p>
				A recent supplemental grant to GLEON has allowed for the expansion of this network in the United 
				States and internationally. The GLEON collaboration now has 22 members from nine countries 
				participating, with more in the planning stages. Several sites in northern Europe were added; students 
				and researchers from Sweden and Finland joined the project; and lakes in northern Scandinavia were 
				instrumented with sensors and linked to the network. Argentina and Chile are expected to participate 
				in the future. In addition, Lake Sunapee in New Hampshire has been set up to automatically download, 
				archive, and publish sensor network data using technologies that conform to emerging GLEON 
				standards. The expanded network will test the dataflow procedures developed to bring information 
				from sensors to publicly accessible databases, as well as the event detection schema developed to help 
				electronically distinguish between biological and physical events such as lake inversion after a storm and 
				sensor failure. As more sensors come online and are linked to the network, it will become necessary to 
				automate processes as data from thousands of sensors stream into the database. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The addition of European lakes will provide a new set of environments to understand lake metabolism 
				and the local and regional phenomena that drive changes in metabolism. In addition, it will 
				provide the opportunity to explore adding existing sensor systems to the current cyberinfrastructure 
				framework. This addition will permit testing of the robustness of the cyberinfrastructure design and the 
				development of plug-and-play technology, and exploration of the challenges that arise from integrating 
				different sensors and protocols. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 16514 BIO/DBI</span>

				The Pan-Arctic River Transport of Nutrients, Organic Matter, 
				and Suspended Sediments (PARTNERS) project is a 5-year 
				project funded by NSF. The overall objective of the project is 
				to use river water chemistry as a means to study the origins and 
				fates of continental runoff. Understanding sources and fates of 
				river discharge is important because rivers make an enormous 
				contribution to the freshwater budget of the Arctic Ocean. 
				Selected parameters focusing on tracers of river water are being 
				measured in the six largest rivers that drain the watershed of the 
				Arctic Ocean: the Yenisey, Lena, Ob’, Mackenzie, Yukon, and 
				Kolyma Rivers. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Analyses of long-term data on river discharge into the Arctic 
				Ocean show an increase over recent decades. If the change in 
				river discharge is linked to global warming, future discharge 
				increases could be large enough to significantly affect the Atlantic 
				thermohaline circulation. In this project, scientists are finding that 
				dams on large Siberian rivers greatly affect the seasonality of discharge; however, on an annual basis, 
				neither dams nor forest fires are making significant contributions to the observed increases in Eurasian 
				river discharge. The project includes representatives of government agencies responsible for discharge 
				and water quality monitoring in Canada, Alaska, and Russia. This will lead to greater comparability of 
				river hydrochemical data in the Arctic Ocean. The group has found, through preliminary analyses of 
				new river water samples, that the Arctic rivers are rather distinct chemically, suggesting that tracing the 
				river water in the Arctic Ocean may be feasible. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 11160 OPP/ARC</span>

			<p>
				Led by National Center for Atmospheric Research scientist Britton Stephens, a team of 
				researchers have found an explanation that puts a new perspective on the “missing” carbon sink. 
				Their findings greatly diminish the apparent 
				discrepancy between overall carbon emissions 
				and the rate of increase of atmospheric carbon 
				dioxide (CO<span class="subscript">2</span>). Additionally, the team’s 
				research indicates that CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				uptake in tropical 
				forests is actually much larger than previously 
				thought, but in northern latitudes it is much lower.

				observations to 
				a variety of atmospheric models, the team 
				found that the models most closely corresponding to observed CO<span class="subscript">2</span>

				These results suggest that northern countries cannot rely on their forests to help

			<p>
				In the past, warm climate episodes favored an 
				increased likelihood of widespread early spring 
				rainfall on melting snow, leading to more 
				frequent large floods on the Upper Mississippi 
				River (UMR). James Knox at the University of 
				Wisconsin-Madison examined layered deposits 
				of sediments along the Mississippi River and 
				correlated flood deposits with average annual 
				temperatures. An unusually high frequency of 
				large overbank floods took place in the UMR 
				valley during the relatively warm Medieval 
				Period, between about A.D. 1000 and A.D. 
				1400. The UMR floods were highly sensitive 
				to an atmospheric circulation that favors an 
				inflow of warm, moist air masses to the UMR valley. When these moist air masses collide along 
				frontal boundaries with cooler air masses from high latitudes, widespread heavy rains fall in the upper 
				Midwest, followed by UMR flooding.
			</p>

			<p>
				This research led to the hypothesis that climate warming favors increased variance in flood 
				magnitudes, including an increased incidence of relatively large, extreme floods. Although this 
				hypothesis may seem at odds with the common idea that warming favors droughts and reduced 
				runoff, the hypothesis recognizes that most large floods on the UMR involve snowmelt, especially 
				when coupled with widespread rainfall. Warm winters and early springs favor the occurrence of 
				rain on melting snow in the UMR watershed. Since about 1950, there have been nearly twice as 
				many large floods as would be expected as a result of statistical chance. Most of these post-1950 
				large floods involved snowmelt, but they also increased the potential for occasional heavy summer 
				rains, because warm air masses typically contain larger quantities of precipitable water vapor than 
				cool air masses. <span class="greyText">Highlight ID: 16447 GEO/ATM</span>

			<p>
				Deforestation is a widespread problem, with implications for forest products, erosion, water quality, 
				biodiversity, tourism, recreation, and climate change. To understand the processes at work and what 
				might stem the tide, James Acheson, professor of anthropology and marine sciences at the University 
				of Maine, used NSF funding to investigate the forest harvesting and conservation decisions of small 
				forestland owners (less than 5,000 acres) in Maine, the most heavily forested state. The research 
				bears directly on the effects of human behavior on the future of forested land in the United States.
			</p>

			<p>
				Acheson’s research revealed four different types of forestland owners: (1) contractors, who buy land, 
				harvest the wood, and resell the land; (2) local business owners, who develop land for houses; (3) 
				large forest products firms; and (4) small landowners, many of whom live or vacation on their forest 
				parcels. Satellite photos revealed that 40 percent of the parcels harvested between 2000 and 2005 
				were converted to housing. Large-scale clear-cutting has ceased, but heavy harvesting persists as 
				contractors, corporations, and other private owners respond to market opportunities. Only a small

				If Maine and the United States are going to keep their forests and all the benefits that come with them,

				Estimates of past storm strengths and frequencies

				Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) examined 
				the mess left by hurricane storm surges—not 
				Katrina on the Gulf Coast, but those in the 
				New York City area. He found at least 10 layers 
				of sand left behind by likely hurricanes in the 
				past 700 years. Donnelly hopes to reconstruct 
				the history of intense storms in southern New 
				England and Long Island by looking at the 
				deposits left by land-falling hurricanes and storm 
				surges in backbarrier salt marshes and kettle 
				ponds found at different heights throughout the 
				area. So far, his group has found sand layers that 
				correspond to the known great storms of 1991, 
				1954, 1938, 1893, 1788, and 1693. Many additional layers indicate storms that date back to 1642–
				1477, 1434–1347, 1316–1257, and even to 1190–1034 and earlier.

				While considered rare in the New York City area, land-falling hurricanes have likely occurred many

				the frequency of land-falling hurricanes in the New York City area is equal to that in southern Rhode 
				Island and higher than that in southern New Jersey. Initial findings suggest that alternating periods 
				of frequent and infrequent hurricane activity have occurred in the past, possibly tied to changes in 
				climate. Donnelly’s group identified the time periods of high hurricane activity in western Long Island 
				to be 3500–3050 years before present (BP) and 2200–900 BP, nearly synchronous with evidence
				of high activity found in the Caribbean and northern

			<p>
				such as rising temperatures and rainfall variability—can affect agriculture, forestry, and other land uses, 
				leading to changes in land-use patterns. These processes are being addressed by the NSF-supported 
				Climate-Land Interaction Project (CLIP), which involves researchers at Michigan State University, 
				Purdue University, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other collaborating 
				institutions, such as the University of Dar es Salaam and Makerere University in Africa, and the 
				University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom.
			</p>

			<p>
				The core question addressed by CLIP scientists is “What is the magnitude and nature of the interaction 
				between land use and climate change at regional and local scales?” This question is being examined 
				in eastern Africa, a region that is undergoing extremely rapid land-use change, including expansion 
				of cropping into savanna lands, increasing irrigation, deforestation, and urbanization. The region 
				straddles the equator and is characterized by a heterogeneous landscape that ranges from glaciated 
				volcanoes and montane forests to coffee, corn, and banana farms, and wide expanses of semi-arid 
				savanna grasslands. 
			</p>

			<p>
				CLIP links climate models, crop-climate models, meteorological and satellite image data, and 
				models of land-use change to assess how climate changes affect land use and vice versa.
				The landuse change models are informed by socioeconomic and biophysical spatial data and by the results 
				of expert systems workshops and role-playing scenarios. The expert systems provide reality-based 
				initial model parameterization and, later, evaluation of the land-use change models. They are central 
				to understanding the human dynamics that respond to economic and other forces, and that lead 
				individuals, groups, and organizations to change land-use practices. The land-use changes affect 
				surface-atmosphere fluxes and alter regional climates, and the expert systems also contribute to the 
				understanding of how people respond to altered climatic conditions. Participants in the expert systems 
				and the role-playing scenarios bring their personal experiences from growing up on farms and their 
				professional insights as government officials and scientists in their fields of environment, finance, and 
				planning. By assessing future scenarios under different resource opportunities and constraints, they 
				provide critical information on the decisionmaking processes that different

				Calibration of Earth History

			<p>
				Accurate dates are essential for understanding a vast array of geological and evolutionary processes, 
				from the causes of mass extinctions to the rates of past climate perturbations to rates of evolution 
				and the timing and causes of mountain building. Although long recognized by paleontologists and 
				others, only recently have geochronologic techniques been refined to produce dates with uncertainties 
				of much less than a million years. In the coming decade, precise geochronology will revolutionize our 
				understanding of Earth history and the rich record of geological, biological, and climate processes. 
				The goal of the EARTHTIME project is to foster an unprecedented national and international 
				collaboration among geochronologists, paleontologists, evolutionary biologists, and stratigraphers, 
				with the goal of producing a high-resolution timescale against which the record of biological evolution, 
				climate change, and oceanic chemistry can be calibrated for at least the past 550 million years. Among 
				other things, the project will require the development of analytical protocols and standards so that 
				geochronologic data from different labs are comparable and can provide dates with uncertainties that
