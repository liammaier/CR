				Earth's Changing Climate
			</h1>

			<p>
				To explain the difference between weather and climate, scientists often say, “Climate is what you 
				expect, weather is what you get.” Climate is the weather of a particular region, averaged over a long 
				period of time.<span class="referenceNumber">1</span>
				Climate is a fundamental factor in ecosystem health—while most species can survive 
				a sudden change in the weather, such as a heat wave, flood, or cold snap—they often cannot survive a 
				long-term change in climate. Global climate is the average of all regional trends, and researchers have 
				concluded that Earth’s climate, as a whole, is warming.
			</p>

			<p>
				Researchers know that human activities including fossil fuel use, agriculture, and land use have been 
				the dominant causes of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the 
				past 250 years. In addition, aerosols and land surface changes are altering Earth’s climate, making it 
				extremely likely<span class="referenceNumber">2</span>
				that human activities have had a net warming effect since 1750.<span class="referenceNumber">3</span>
				These human-caused 
				changes to the climate system, and their consequences, provide much of the impetus for the National 
				Science Foundation’s (NSF) climate change research.
			</p>

			<p>
				Researchers funded by NSF have discovered signs of a changing climate in nearly every corner of the 
				globe, from the icy expanses of the polar regions of Earth to its equatorial ecosystems. Our planet’s 
				climate affects—and is affected by—the sky, land, ice, sea, life, and the people found on Earth. To

				piece together the entire puzzle of climate change—what we know, what we still have to learn and 
				what humankind can do to prepare for the future—we must study all of the physical, natural, and 
				human systems that contribute to, and interact with, Earth’s climate system.
			</p>

			<p>
				As researchers work together to solve the climate puzzle, they are revolutionizing the way we understand 
				the Earth system as a whole. Researchers have realized that they must reach across disciplinary boundaries 
				to study questions that extend beyond any one field of science or engineering. In fact, because of the 
				complexity of Earth’s climate, this research involves contributions from nearly every field of science, math, 
				and engineering. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In no area is NSF’s contribution more important—or more influential—than in interdisciplinary research. 
				NSF responds to the needs of research communities by supporting teams that include experts from multiple 
				disciplines. NSF is unique among other government agencies with a science mission because NSF funds 
				research, infrastructure, and education across <em>all</em> disciplines of science and engineering.
			</p>

			<p>
				With its emphasis on supporting pioneering research, NSF is well positioned to support the broad federal 
				agency response to climate change. The basic research NSF funds is essential to creating a vibrant and strong 
				foundation for the important work of the mission agencies that are responsible for the U.S. government’s 
				monitoring of, and response to, climate change and variability. Basic research underpins what we currently 
				know about Earth’s changing climate, and will continue to play a vital role in the discovery of new 
				knowledge and the development of tools to help humankind respond to the effects of global climate change. 
				NSF must maintain its steadfast support of the American academic system’s groundbreaking research and 
				world-class educational programs in order to continue providing the next-generation of people and ideas 
				that will help the United States and the world meet 
				the challenges imposed by global climate change.

				NSF personnel and awardees regularly work 
				with each other, other government agencies, and 
				international organizations to strengthen the goals 
				of climate change research and to identify the 
				unanswered scientific questions. They participate in 
				the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) 
				and have served as authors for its numerous 
				Synthesis Assessment Product reports. NSF—the 
				lead U.S. agency in Antarctic research—coordinates 
				and facilitates the activities of NSF- and mission 
				agency-supported research near both poles, areas 
				where some of the most important observational 
				data on global climate change are gathered.<span class="referenceNumber">4</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				Scores of NSF-supported researchers, including 
				over 40 researchers from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)—an NSF-supported 
				research facility and one of the nation’s most important assets in climate research—have participated in the 
				United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Numerous NSF-funded researchers 
				served in leadership roles in the latest IPCC assessment report, and they continue to make significant 
				progress on the research goals identified in the report.
			</p>

			<p>
				Basic research on the frontiers of mitigation and adaptation strategies, including geoengineering, is an 
				NSF investment area that will become increasingly important in the coming years. NSF’s emphasis on 
				exploratory, potentially transformative, basic research makes the agency a natural leader in identifying the 
				most promising strategies for mission agencies, corporations or other organizations to adopt and pursue. 
				NSF’s support of economic research, including emissions trading scenarios and the incorporation of 
				economic theory into climate modeling, will help to inform government climate policy decisions.

				NSF investments have played a crucial role in our understanding of Earth’s climate past, present, and 
				potential future. From its inception, NSF has funded the research of climatologists including Charles David 
				Keeling, whose data on increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are considered pivotal 
				early evidence in support of the hypothesis of anthropogenic climate change.<span class="referenceNumber">5</span>
				NSF funding through the
				decades has led to many of the most fundamental discoveries and advances in human knowledge about 
				the causes and consequences of global climate change and variability. Paleoclimate records, computational 
				climate models, and economic models of climate change are just some examples of the major contributions 
				of NSF’s investments in this area. In the future, as the world’s human population turns its attention to 
				managing and coping with the effects of climate change, NSF-funded basic research will continue to provide 
				the necessary platform for technological advances, in areas including energy and geoengineering.

				Paleoclimatologists have discovered—through tree ring data, ice cores, and other corroborating 
				records—that the concentration of carbon dioxide, and Earth’s average temperature, are nearing levels 
				that haven’t been reached for hundreds of thousands of years.<span class="referenceNumber">12</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				Innovative scientists and engineers have responded to the call for alternative energy sources that reduce 
				the amount of carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere. Computer scientists are creating new 
				tools for geoscientists, decisionmakers, and the public to understand Earth’s changing climate. Social 
				scientists are studying human decisions and behaviors that influence the environment. By studying 
				such issues as land use, urban planning, building design, and economic factors that are linked to 
				anthropogenic climate change, researchers are beginning to tackle some of the more nuanced, but 
				essential, questions regarding the human impact on, and response to, Earth’s changing climate.
			</p>

			<p>
				This report addresses some of the major questions facing climate change researchers, and how 
				those puzzles are being addressed by NSF-funded activities. Complex computer models are 
				being developed and refined to predict Earth’s future climate. Observations of climate conditions 
				from observatory networks distributed in Earth’s oceans, polar regions, land masses, and near Earth
				orbit improve the accuracy of the climate models. Records of Earth’s past climate provide 
				important insights into the mechanisms involved in climate cycles of the past, and can help to refine 
				computational models by allowing researchers to simulate past climate. But understanding climate 
				is only part of the story—as we improve our knowledge of how Earth’s climate is changing, we 
				also improve our ability to cope with the impacts of global climate change and variability. Through 
				social, economic, and behavioral science, researchers are learning how human behavior factors into 
				climate change—and how human behavior can be modified to ameliorate our impact on Earth’s 
				climate. Physical scientists and engineers are developing alternative ways of creating, storing, and 
				using energy to reduce the amount of carbon that human activities contribute to the atmosphere. 
				Researchers are also building the scientific foundation for the tools that humanity may need in the 
				future to counteract the effects of global climate change.

				Computational Tools
			</h1>

			<p>
				Predicting Earth’s future climate depends on advanced computational hardware, software, and 
				networking capabilities. Increasing demands on computational resources result from the increasing 
				sophistication of the models, which are advancing to include an ever-expanding number of physical 
				parameters of Earth’s climate system. To keep up with the demand, computational hardware must 
				involve not only bigger and faster supercomputers, but entirely new computer architectures—e.g. 
				data centers that can process massive amounts of data in parallel—and new devices, including smart 
				sensors, smart phones and robots to acquire data. To make the most effective use of the progress in 
				hardware, reliable, advanced, and intelligent software will be essential. Increasingly sophisticated 
				algorithms, new representations of data, and new programming models and languages are a handful 
				of the types of software advances that will be required. New networking tools will not only connect 
				computers and scientists, they will also be essential to acquiring data from remote sensors and 
				instruments, such as satellites, buoys, and environmental sensor stations. As discussed in the following 
				section, networked observational tools are vital to increasing our understanding of climate. They 
				present computer scientists and engineers with the challenges of integrating vast quantities of data 
				gathered across different platforms and network types.

				In response to the growing demand for data from the research community, NSF is expanding its 
				observational network infrastructure. Some of these networks, including the National Ecological 
				Observatory Network (NEON) and the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI), are new, state-of-the-art efforts in
				collaboration with international partners. These networks take advantage of the latest 
				in cyberinfrastructure and computational linking technologies, one of NSF’s core strengths. Other 
				observatories, such as the Critical Zone Observatories, are in their infancy, but provide crucial testing

				of an interagency and international effort to 
				enable coordinated observations, better data 
				management, and increased data sharing.13
