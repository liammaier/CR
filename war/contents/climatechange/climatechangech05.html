				If climate had no significant impact on Earth’s 
				ecosystems and living things, climate change 
				would be a mere curiosity of planetary science. 
				Instead, we know that ecosystems evolved in 
				concert with predictable annual weather patterns 
				for survival. Changing weather patterns affect 
				where plants can grow and where animals can 
				thrive. Even small changes in climate can tip the 
				delicate balance of competition and cooperation 
				among the residents of an ecosystem. The 
				potential for climate change to disrupt life on 
				Earth makes studying it essential.

				environments, wetlands, tundra, and other habitats store vast amounts of carbon. Land cover and 
				the choices humans make about determining where plants will grow can have a profound impact 
				on both regional and global climate. Understanding the biological processes involved in the carbon

				NSF supports biologists as they seek a greater understanding of what a warmer global climate means 
				to life on Earth. NSF supports 63 percent of the fundamental environmental biology research at 
				U.S. academic institutions, fostering advances in the biological sciences through research grants and 
				providing the infrastructure to enable those advances.<span class="referenceNumber">1</span>

				The urgency of this research comes sharply into focus when we realize that our own species is highly 
				dependent on Earth’s ecosystems. Living organisms do much more for us than provide food, clothing, 
				and shelter. Plants are not only responsible for the very oxygen we breathe; they help regulate the 
				temperature and moisture of the places we call home. Plant roots prevent topsoil from eroding away or 
				burying our houses. Forests of swaying trees and acres of wetlands literally calm storms by dissipating 
				wind and wave energy. Microorganisms decompose our garbage and help us digest our food. Without 
				the ecosystems of the world, big and small, our existence would be impossible.

				Long-Term Ecological Research

			<p>
				To understand how climate change affects an ecosystem, continuous observational records of that 
				ecosystem are necessary. For more than 25 years, NSF has steadfastly supported the Long-Term 
				Ecological Research (LTER) Network, a collaborative effort currently involving more than 1,800 
				scientists and students studying ecological processes at sites strategically located around the United 
				States, Puerto Rico, Tahiti, and Antarctica. The 26 LTER sites are windows to global change.

			<p>
				As observatories, they document long-term 
				changes in plants, animals, microbes, and soils 
				in relation to short-term weather and longterm climate changes. LTER sites illuminate 
				interactions among the physical, chemical, 
				and biological components of ecosystems 
				through controlled experiments and long-term 
				observations. These sites allow comparisons 
				of the relative sensitivity of populations, 
				communities, and ecosystems to environmental 
				change. The synthesis and modeling of data from 
				LTER sites enable predictions of feedbacks, both 
				positive and negative, on global change. Research 
				at LTER sites spans the range from relatively less 
				managed landscapes, such as Arctic tundra, to 
				intensively managed cities and farmlands.<span class="referenceNUmber">2</span>

				Species Adaptation
			</h1>

			<p>
				In field studies, biologists are encountering change in 
				nearly every ecosystem they study, and some species seem 
				especially susceptible to the effects of a warmer climate. 
				Polar bears are one famous example of a species that seems 
				particularly vulnerable to warming. The sea ice they require 
				to access Arctic ringed seals (a primary source of food) is 
				melting, diminishing their hunting range. Even if polar 
				bears are able to adapt to a warmer, land-based lifestyle, 
				competition, potential hybridization with grizzly bears, 
				and increased human interactions would present significant 
				challenges to the species’ survival.<span class="referenceNumber">5</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				NSF-supported researchers have documented other species 
				at risk, including many of the world’s amphibians. Results 
				from an NSF-funded study provide the first evidence 
				of a link between climate change and outbreaks of an 
				infectious disease that has wiped out dozens of tropical 
				frog populations.<span class="referenceNumber">6</span>
				Other NSF-funded researchers have 
				compiled the latest information on the distribution and 
				diversity of more than 4,000 mammal species to analyze 
				the risk of extinction owing to threats including global 
				climate change.<span class="referenceNumber">7</span>
				This type of information can identify 
				“hotspots” of endangered species, helping conservationists 
				decide how to best allocate their resources.

				While some species seem destined for extinction because 
				of rapid climate change, other species are providing

				documented genetic shifts in natural populations resulting from climate change. These studies suggest 
				that extreme variation in temperature and rainfall are selecting for genetic shifts in organisms with life 
				spans short enough to allow some adaptation at the current rate of climate change. In one example, 
				the rise of drought conditions in southern California selected for a genetic shift in populations of field 
				mustard plants (a common weed). Plant populations exposed to several years of drought bloomed sooner, 
				increasing their chances of reproducing before drying out from a lack of rain. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In another example, researchers found genetic shifts in fruit flies that correspond to temperature increases. 
				Researchers compared genetic evidence collected almost 30 years ago from wild fruit flies with the 
				genetic profiles of present-day fruit flies. They found that flies at higher latitudes have the chromosomal 
				characteristics associated with the low-latitude flies in the original study. The low-latitude chromosome 
				changes are thought to protect the flies from warmer temperatures; thus, the flies appear to have undergone 
				genetic adaptation to warmer temperatures.<span class="referenceNumber">8</span>
				Genetic changes attributed to global warming-related seasonal 
				changes have also been observed in populations of migrating birds,
				mosquitoes, and other species.<span class="referenceNumber">9</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition to genetic adaptation, rising temperatures and CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				levels can influence gene expression. 
				In a recent study, NSF-supported researchers demonstrated that flowering
				plants grown in the elevated CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				levels projected by current climate models bloomed significantly later than equivalent plants grown 
				at modern atmospheric CO<span class="subscript">2</span>
				levels. This research has important implications for predicting the future 
				behavior of plant and crop species.<span class="referenceNUuber">10</span>

				Conclusion
			</h1>

			<p>
				Life on Earth has a direct and profound effect on global climate; it is a vital link in the carbon chain. 
				Ecosystems such as forests regulate the flow of heat and moisture in a region, contributing to local 
				climate patterns. The climate models of the future will have to account for the effects of living things 
				to produce accurate climate forecasts. Living things are vulnerable to climate change; in a warming 
				world, plants and animals will face significant changes in their habitats. Some species have already 
				demonstrated the ability to adapt to a changing climate, but we do not yet have a full understanding 
				of the implications of anthropogenic climate change on the planet’s plant and animal species.
				Long-term environmental observations, fieldwork, and statistical analyses of ecosystem data have yielded 
				important information about the effects of climate change on the biosphere. In the research highlights 
				below, numerous NSF-funded life research projects are described. These projects have all contributed 
				to our understanding of how life on Earth is both influencing and influenced by climate change. This 
				research also provides invaluable experience and training to the next generation of life scientists.

				Global warming is causing outbreaks of an

				In the remote mountainous areas of Costa Rica, 
				the Monteverde harlequin frog (Atelopus sp.) and 
				the golden toad (Bufo periglenes) have not been 
				seen since the 1980s, and are considered extinct

				sent alarm and suspicion throughout the scientific community. Today, almost 70 percent of the 110 
				species of the colorful Atelopus frogs endemic to the Americas have gone extinct as a result of a lethal 
				fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis). Using records of sea surface and air temperatures, researchers 
				have provided evidence that harlequin frogs are disappearing in near lockstep with changing climate. 
				According to the scientists’ hypothesis, Earth’s rising temperatures enhance cloud cover on tropical 
				mountains, leading to cooler days and warmer nights, both of which favor the chytrid fungus.

				The study results come at a time of growing concern about the future of amphibians. The Global

				Genetic Consequences of Climate Change

			<p>
				Recently, multiple NSF-funded researchers have documented genetic changes resulting from climate 
				change. These studies suggest that extreme variation in temperature and rainfall are causing genetic 
				shifts in organisms with short life spans.
			</p>

			<p>
				At the University of California-Irvine, Arthur Weis is studying how a 5-year California drought caused 
				genetic changes in field mustard, a weedy plant that is common throughout the United States. Weis 
				collected seeds from wild plants before and after the drought, then raised them under identical 
				conditions to observe differences between the two samples. Even when provided with sufficient 
				amounts of water, plants grown from postdrought seeds bloomed sooner. During the drought, natural 
				selection favored this particular trait because it allowed the plants to seed successfully before conditions 
				became fatally dry. Building on this study, Weis is organizing an NSF-funded workshop to stimulate a 
				concerted scientific effort to collect and preserve seeds across North America. Called Project Baseline, 
				this undertaking will provide scientists with an important resource for studying future climate change–

				On a global scale, Raymond Huey of the University of Washington and George Gilchrist of the

				increases. In their study, they examined a certain type of genetic change known as a chromosomal 
				inversion. More than 40 years ago, scientists documented these genetic rearrangements in wild 
				populations of the fruit fly species Drosophila subobscuraand noted that the frequency of the inversions 
				correlated with the flies’ latitude. Although the exact purpose of the inversion is unknown, it appears

				Climate Change: A Driver of Evolution
			</h1>

			<p>
				Climate change has resulted in heritable genetic changes in species as diverse as birds, squirrels, and 
				mosquitoes, and in traits such as range limits, reproductive patterns, dormancy, and migration. Because 
				the most obvious facet of climate change is increasing temperatures, it is tempting to simply attribute 
				these genetic changes to higher temperatures. However, many species use day length as a critical cue, 
				and changing temperatures can lead to a mismatch between those cues and environmental conditions. 
				As discussed by William E. Bradshaw and Christina M. Holzapfel of the University of Oregon in a 
				recent publication, scientists are discovering that adaptation to changes in day length and the timing of 
				growing seasons can be important when species adapt to climate change. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In a study involving the pitcher-plant mosquito, Bradshaw and colleagues experimentally raised 
				mosquitoes from a northern population in a simulated southern climate with shorter days. The 
				mosquitoes laid fewer eggs— 88 percent of the loss was due to transplanted mosquitoes experiencing 
				the incorrect day length relative to temperature. As climate change occurs, many species in the 
				Northern Hemisphere will migrate northward to avoid increasing heat stress. However, species for 
				which day length is an important determinant of development and reproduction will have to adapt 
				to the new day length to avoid a mismatch. This study emphasizes the complex nature of global 
				change and the need to understand how many aspects of that change will interact with organisms 
				and their evolution.

				Bradshaw and Holzapfel note that evolutionary adaptation to rapid, human-caused climate change is 
				only likely to occur in small animals with short life cycles and large population sizes, because those are 
				conditions that allow fairly rapid evolution. Large animals with long life cycles and smaller population 
				sizes may have no options but to migrate to cooler climates, suffer declines in population size, or 
				simply be replaced by species from historically warmer climates. Though researchers are still examining 
				exact mechanisms and rates of evolutionary change, it is widely recognized that climate change will

				for millennia. Vegetative changes are expected 
				to be extensive owing to climate change, 
				particularly in Arctic tundra habitats. The 
				Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
				estimates that warming may result in the loss of as much as 40 percent of current tundra by the year 
				2100; it will be replaced by boreal forest.
			</p>

			<p>
				An NSF-supported project involving M. Syndonia Bret-Harte from the University of Alaska, 
				Fairbanks, examined the loss of pristine tundra habitat and its relation to climate change. While

				As a result of climate change, cloud water is

				The loss of epiphytes will have consequences for ecosystem biodiversity, productivity, and resilience,

			Long-Term Study Leads to Elegant Understanding: Nitrogen Cycling

		<p>
			NSF researchers have simplified a previously complicated understanding of nitrogen release from 
			decaying plants into the soil, making important contributions to global modeling of nitrogen and 
			carbon cycles. The Long-Term Intersite Decomposition Experiment Team (LIDET), led by William 
			Parton of Colorado State University, found that the amount of nitrogen released by bacteria as 
			they decompose fallen leaves and dead roots is controlled universally by two factors: the initial 
			concentration of nitrogen in the organic matter and the mass of the organic matter remaining. This 
			information was used by LIDET to develop simple equations to model nitrogen release.
		</p>

		<p>
			Because the controls for nitrogen release are the same at nearly every biome, modelers can use 
			Parton’s equations to improve global climate change models. Understanding global nitrogen cycling 
			is important, because the release of nitrogen from decaying matter by bacteria and fungi in the soil 
			provides ammonium and nitrate to plants. Ammonium and nitrate, inorganic forms of nitrogen that 
			are essential to plant growth, are often in short supply to plants and therefore limit plant growth. An 
			improved understanding of the role of nitrogen release in decaying matter will help scientists 
			understand plant growth, and therefore carbon uptake, in global climate models. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The researchers were able to develop a global understanding of nitrogen release as they repeated the 
			same decomposition study at 21 sites encompassing diverse ecosystems ranging from tropical forests 
			to tundra. After 10 years of measurements, the researchers synthesized their data using resources at 
			the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), a center funded by NSF that 
			develops and tests important ecological ideas and theories using existing data. Through the work at 
			NCEAS, LIDET found that the release of nitrogen was controlled by the same factors at nearly all of 
			their sites. They were able to use this information to develop a simple and elegant set of equations of

			accelerate rates of permafrost melting, organic

			decompose and release even more greenhouse 
			gases (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) into 
			the atmosphere. However, Kelman Weider of

			while warming leads to permafrost melting, it 
			also increases the growth of mosses that take up 
			carbon from the atmosphere. These scientists 
			found that the extent to which vegetation 
			responds to changed climate has important 
			feedbacks to Earth’s climate system.

			Peatlands form slowly as decayed vegetation collects over permafrost. Over time, these boreal wetlands

			During this research, the investigators also studied soil cores from the peatlands. These cores can tell

			How Climate Change Is Choking Marine Ecosystems
		</h1>

		<p>
			While investigating the effects of climate change on nitrogen cycling in temperate coastal systems, 
			Rhode Island researchers made the first scientific link between warming and fundamental changes in 
			nutrient cycles. Researchers found that the observed estuary shifted from acting as a nitrogen filter to 
			acting as a nitrogen source—which has a profoundly negative impact on marine ecological systems. 
			Previously, when denitrification (removal of nitrogen) dominated the cycle, coastal marine sediments 
			cleansed the water of excess nitrogen. When nitrogen fixation, the process of converting nitrogen into 
			a biologically usable form of nitrogen (such as ammonium or nitrate), dominated the cycle, more 
			nitrogen was brought into the system. Researchers discovered that the sediments added more than 1.5 
			times the amount of nitrogen from the land and atmosphere combined. If this process is happening 
			in other places, the sediments can produce large amounts of nitrogen, which could have significant 
			consequences for offshore systems. The investigator who led the research is now examining nitrogen 
			cycling in the Louisiana wetlands to determine whether similar conditions exist.

			EcoPod is a PDA-based mobile capture and access system that enhances the value of observations 
			made by researchers and citizen-scientists—trained volunteers who work on real-world questions—
			around the globe by increasing both the efficiency of the identification process and its reliability. 
			Biological studies rely heavily on large collections of observations of species. For example, changes 
			in the abundance of certain species or the timing of life events, such as flowering time, are critical to 
			understand the effects of urbanization and climate change or the invasion of foreign animal species on 
			local crops. Professional efforts are limited by geography and time. Thus, expanded
			access to easy-touse tools can allow amateurs to make important scientific contributions. Communities of amateurs 
			have yielded key insights, for example, in identifying critical habitat for the Monarch butterfly or 
			changes in bird migration patterns and abundance. The challenge with such contributions is their 
			questionable quality.

			Identification is done by decision trees (graphs of decisions with branches showing alternatives), 
			which are called “keys” in biology. EcoPod technology saves time by soliciting as little information 
			from the user as possible to identify a species. This optimization of minimization is accomplished by 
			continuously analyzing the most discriminating questions to ask the user about the specimen at hand 
			and selecting only the characteristics that can be observed in the field at a given time and location; 
			that is, the system has context awareness. At the same time, EcoPod places no restrictions on the order 
			in which its users enter characteristics they observe. The tool records the results of identifications and

			creates a step-by-step record of the identification process, thereby providing an audit trail for quality 
			assurance. The system also has rapid recovery from mistakes and terminates the process when no 
			additional steps are necessary to make an identification. Users may create and attach written notes and 
			photos to decision points along the way. All of this can be uploaded to large databases, such as eBirds 
			or “Butterflies I’ve Seen,” without additional transcription to Web-forms.

			While designed with ecologists and other field researchers in mind, the technology can be generalized

			Nature Versus Nurture: How Does Genetic Structure Affect Plant Response to Environmental Cues?
		</h1>

		<p>			
			Why did daffodils and cherry trees bloom in the middle of January in Washington, D.C., in 
			2007? Will such unseasonable flowering be common in the future as global warming leads to 
			milder winters? If so, how will this seasonal mismatch affect crop yields or the persistence of wild 
			plant populations? To answer such questions, it is important to understand how plants combine 
			information from multiple environmental cues—such as day length, growth temperature and past 
			winter chilling—to flower in favorable seasonal conditions, and how natural genetic differences in 
			responses to these cues allow plants to inhabit diverse geographic regions and respond to ongoing 
			climate change. An interdisciplinary research team, headed by Johanna Schmitt, is studying natural 
			genetic variation in flowering responses in the tiny weed <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> (mouse ear cress). This 
			plant—a close relative of crops such as canola, broccoli, and cabbage—is the principal model used in 
			molecular plant genetics research.
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Arabidopsisis</em> native to Eurasia and present throughout most of North America. Across the native 
			range, the species inhabits a wide range of climates, from Mediterranean to subarctic. To investigate 
			the genetic mechanisms underlying this broad climatic range, the research team is collecting molecular, 
			genetic, and ecological data for sets of plants derived from the different ecological and environmental 
			settings (ecotypes) of <em>A. thaliana</em> across the native geographic ranges. They are testing whether observed 
			DNA variation of the ecotypes is associated with natural geographic differences in flowering responses. 
			At the same time, the team is growing the ecotypes under natural field conditions in different sites 
			in Spain, eastern and western Germany, England, and Finland, in collaboration with seven leading 
			European <em>Arabidopsis</em> researchers, to determine how natural genetic variation in the flowering 
			mechanisms affects performance across the climatic range of the species. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Preliminary findings suggest that a natural variant of a single gene can change the entire life cycle 
			of the plant from one that requires winter chilling for flowering and has one generation per year to 
			one that does not require chilling to flower and has several generations per year in regions where the 
			growing season is long and mild. As in the United States, recent winter weather has been unusually 
			warm in Europe, so the team has also had an unexpected opportunity to examine its effects on the 
			flowering and reproductive success of <em>Arabidopsis</em> plants under field conditions, taking detailed 
			measurements of the environmental cues the plants experience in each site. Just like the cherry trees in 
			Washington, many of the experimental plants flowered unexpectedly and unseasonably early, which 
			allowed the team to examine the genetic basis of flowering responses to a warming climate.
		</p>

		<p>
			Understanding how natural genetic differences affect flowering patterns in response to environmental 
			cues is an important step in recognizing the overall interplay of environmental influences on genetics. 
			This groundbreaking research could not only advance the understanding of plant genetics and 
			development, but could potentially lead to advances in crop engineering and other pioneering fields.
