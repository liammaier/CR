		<h2>Introduction to Decision Making Skills</h2>
	
		<p class="skimmable">All of us have to make decisions every day. Some decisions are relatively straightforward and simple: Is this report ready to send to my boss now? Others are quite complex: Which of these candidates should I select for the job?</p>
	
		<p>Simple decisions usually need a simple decision-making process. But difficult decisions typically involve issues like these:</p>
	
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Uncertainty</strong> &#8211; Many facts may not be known.</li>
			<li><strong>Complexity</strong> &#8211; You have to consider many interrelated factors.</li>
			<li><strong>High&#45;risk consequences</strong> &#8211; The impact of the decision may be significant.</li>
			<li><strong>Alternatives</strong> &#8211; Each has its own set of uncertainties and consequences.</li>
			<li><strong>Interpersonal issues</strong> &#8211; It can be difficult to predict how other people will react.</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>With these difficulties in mind, the best way to make a complex decision is to use an effective process. Clear processes usually lead to consistent, high-quality results, and they can improve the quality of almost everything we do. In this article, we outline a process that will help improve the quality of your decisions.</p>
	
		<h4>A Systematic Approach to Decision Making</h4>
	
		<p>A logical and systematic decision-making process helps you address the critical elements that result in a good decision. By taking an organized approach, you're less likely to miss important factors, and you can build on the approach to make your decisions better and better.</p>
	
		<p>There are six steps to making an effective decision:</p>
	
		<ol class="indent-outside">
			<li>Create a constructive environment.</li>
			<li>Generate good alternatives.</li>
			<li>Explore these alternatives.</li>
			<li>Choose the best alternative.</li>
			<li>Check your decision.</li>
			<li>Communicate your decision, and take action.</li>
		</ol>
	
		<p>Here are the steps in detail:</p>
	
		<h5>Step 1: Create a constructive environment</h5>
	
		<p>To create a constructive environment for successful decision making, make sure you do the following:</p>
	
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Establish the objective</strong> &#8211; Define what you want to achieve.</li>
			<li><strong>Agree on the process</strong> &#8211; Know how the final decision will be made, including whether it will be an individual or a team-based decision. The Vroom&#45;Yetton&#45;Jago Model (member only) is a great tool for determining the most appropriate way of making the decision.</li>
			<li><strong>Involve the right people</strong> &#8211; Stakeholder Analysis is important in making an effective decision, and you&#39;ll want to ensure that you&#39;ve consulted stakeholders appropriately even if you&#39;re making an individual decision. Where a group process is appropriate, the decision&#45;making group &#8211; typically a team of five to seven people &#8211; should have a good representation of stakeholders.</li>
		</ul>
	
		<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">117</span></div>
	
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Allow opinions to be heard</strong> &#8211; Encourage participants to contribute to the discussions, debates, and analysis without any fear of rejection from the group. This is one of the best ways to avoid groupthink (member only). The Stepladder Technique is a useful method for gradually introducing more and more people to the group discussion, and making sure everyone is heard. Also, recognize that the objective is to make the best decision under the circumstances: it&#39;s not a game in which people are competing to have their own preferred alternatives adopted.</li>
			<li><strong>Make sure you&#39;re asking the right question</strong> &#8211; Ask yourself whether this is really the true issue. The 5 Whys technique is a classic tool that helps you identify the real underlying problem that you face.</li>
			<li><strong>Use creativity tools from the start</strong> &#8211; The basis of creativity is thinking from a different perspective. Do this when you first set out the problem, and then continue it while generating alternatives. Our article Generating New Ideas will help you create new connections in your mind, break old thought patterns, and consider new perspectives.</li>
		</ul>
	
		<h5>Step 2: Generate Good Alternatives</h5>
	
		<p>This step is still critical to making an effective decision. The more good options you consider, the more comprehensive your final decision will be.</p>
	
		<p>When you generate alternatives, you force yourself to dig deeper, and look at the problem from different angles. If you use the mindset &#8216;there must be other solutions out there,&#8217; you&#39;re more likely to make the best decision possible. If you don&#39;t have reasonable alternatives, then there&#39;s really not much of a decision to make!</p>
	
		<p>Here&#39;s a summary of some of the key tools and techniques to help you and your team develop good alternatives.</p>
	
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Generating Ideas</strong></li>
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
				<li>Brainstorming is probably the most popular method of generating ideas.</li>
				<li>Another approach, Reverse Brainstorming, works similarly. However, it starts by asking people to brainstorm how to achieve the opposite outcome from the one wanted, and then reversing these actions.</li>
				<li>The Charette Procedure is a systematic process for gathering and developing ideas from very many stakeholders.</li>
				<li>Use the Crawford Slip Writing Technique (member only) to generate ideas from a large number of people. This is an extremely effective way to make sure that everyone&#39;s ideas are heard and given equal weight, irrespective of the person&#39;s position or power within the organization.</li>
			</ul>
		
			<li><strong>Considering Different Perspectives</strong></li>
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
				<li>The Reframing Matrix uses 4 Ps (product, planning, potential, and people) as the basis for gathering different perspectives. You can also ask outsiders to join the discussion, or ask existing participants to adopt different functional perspectives (for example, have a marketing person speak from the viewpoint of a financial manager).</li>
				</li><span>If you have very few options, or an unsatisfactory alternative, use a Concept Fan to take a step back from the problem, and approach it from a wider perspective. This often helps when the people involved in the decision are too close to the problem.</li>
				</li><span>Appreciative Inquiry forces you to look at the problem based on what&#39;s &#8216;going right,&#8217; rather than what&#39;s &#8216;going wrong.&#8217;</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	
		<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">118</span></div>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Organizing Ideas</strong><br>
				This is especially helpful when you have a large number of ideas. Sometimes separate ideas can be combined into one comprehensive alternative.</li>
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
				<li>Use Affinity Diagrams to organize ideas into common themes and groupings.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		
		<h5>Step 3: Explore the Alternatives</h5>
		
		<p>When you&#39;re satisfied that you have a good selection of realistic alternatives, then you&#39;ll need to evaluate the feasibility, risks, and implications of each choice. Here, we discuss some of the most popular and effective analytical tools.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Risk</strong><br>
			In decision making, there's usually some degree of uncertainty, which inevitably leads to risk. By evaluating the risk involved with various options, you can determine whether the risk is manageable.</li>
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
				<li>Risk Analysis helps you look at risks objectively. It uses a structured approach for assessing threats, and for evaluating the probability of events occurring &#8211; and what they might cost to manage.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<li><strong>Implications</strong><br>
			Another way to look at your options is by considering the potential consequences of each.</li>
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
				<li>Six Thinking Hats helps you evaluate the consequences of a decision by looking at the alternatives from six different perspectives.</li>
				<li>Impact Analysis (member only) is a useful technique for brainstorming the &#8216;unexpected&#8217; consequences that may arise from a decision.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<li><strong>Validation</strong><br>
			Determine if resources are adequate, if the solution matches your objectives, and if the decision is likely to work in the long term.</li>
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
				<li>Starbursting helps you think about the questions you should ask to evaluate an alternative properly.</li>
				<li>To assess pros and cons of each option, use Force Field Analysis, or use the Plus&#45;Minus&#45;Interesting approach.</li>
				<li>Cost&#45;Benefit Analysis looks at the financial feasibility of an alternative.</li>
				<li>Our Bite&#45;Sized Training session on Project Evaluation and Financial Forecasting (member only) helps you evaluate each alternative using the most popular financial evaluation techniques.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		
		<h5>Step 4: Choose the Best Alternative</h5>
		
		<p>After you have evaluated the alternatives, the next step is to choose between them. The choice may be obvious. However, if it isn&#39;t, these tools will help:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Grid Analysis, also known as a decision matrix, is a key tool for this type of evaluation. It&#39;s invaluable because it helps you bring disparate factors into your decision&#45;making process in a reliable and rigorous way.</li>
			<li>Use Paired Comparison Analysis to determine the relative importance of various factors. This helps you compare unlike factors, and decide which ones should carry the most weight in your decision.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">119</span></div>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Decision Trees are also useful in choosing between options. These help you lay out the different options open to you, and bring the likelihood of project success or failure into the decision making process.</li>
		</ul>
	
		<div class="grey-background">
			<p>For group decisions, there are some excellent evaluation methods available.</p>
		
			<p>When decision criteria are subjective and it&#39;s critical that you gain consensus, you can use techniques like Nominal Group Technique (member only) and Multi&#45;Voting (member only). These methods help a group agree on priorities, for example, so that they can assign resources and funds.</p>
		
			<p>The Delphi Technique (member only) uses multiple cycles of anonymous written discussion and argument, managed by a facilitator. Participants in the process do not meet, and sometimes they don&#39;t even know who else is involved. The facilitator controls the process, and manages the flow and organization of information. This is useful where you need to bring the opinions of many different experts into the decision&#45;making process. It&#39;s particularly useful where some of these experts don&#39;t get on!</p>
		</div>
		
		<h5>Step 5: Check Your Decision</h5>
		
		<p>With all of the effort and hard work that goes into evaluating alternatives, and deciding the best way forward, it&#39;s easy to forget to &#8216;sense check&#8217; your decisions. This is where you look at the decision you&#39;re about to make dispassionately, to make sure that your process has been thorough, and to ensure that common errors haven&#39;t crept into the decision&#45;making process. After all, we can all now see the catastrophic consequences that over&#45;confidence, groupthink, and other decision&#45;making errors have wrought on the world economy.</p>
		
		<p>The first part of this is an intuitive step, which involves quietly and methodically testing the assumptions and the decisions you&#39;ve made against your own experience, and thoroughly reviewing and exploring any doubts you might have.</p>
		
		<p>A second part involves using a technique like Blindspot Analysis (member only) to review whether common decision&#45;making problems like over&#45;confidence, escalating commitment, or groupthink (member only) may have undermined the decision&#45;making process.</p>
		
		<p>A third part involves using a technique like the Ladder of Inference (member only) to check through the logical structure of the decision with a view to ensuring that a well&#45;founded and consistent decision emerges at the end of the decision&#45;making process.</p>
		
		<h5>Step 6: Communicate Your Decision, and Move to Action!</h5>
		
		<p>Once you&#39;ve made your decision, it&#39;s important to explain it to those affected by it, and involved in implementing it. Talk about why you chose the alternative you did. The more information you provide about risks and projected benefits, the more likely people are to support the decision.</p>
		
		<p>And with respect to implementation of your decision, our articles on Project Management and Change Management (member only) will help you get this implementation off to a good start!</p>
		
		<h4>Key Points</h4>
		
		<p>An organized and systematic decision&#45;making process usually leads to better decisions. Without a well&#45;defined process, you risk making decisions that are based on insufficient information and analysis. Many variables affect the final impact of your decision. However, if you establish strong foundations for decision making, generate good alternatives, evaluate these alternatives rigorously, and then check your decision&#45;making process, you will improve the quality of your decisions.</p>

		<section class="subsection" data-number="2" data-name="Pareto Analysis">
			<h3>Pareto Analysis</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Choosing the most important changes to make</div>
			
			<p class="skimmable">Pareto analysis is a very simple technique that helps you to choose the most effective changes to make.</p>
			
			<p>It uses the Pareto principle &#8211; the idea that by doing 20% of work you can generate 80% of the advantage of doing the entire job*. Pareto analysis is a formal technique for finding the changes that will give the biggest benefits. It is useful where many possible courses of action are competing for your attention.</p>
			
			<h4>How to Use the Tool</h4>
			
			<p>To start using the tool, write out a list of the changes you could make. If you have a long list, group it into related changes.</p>
			
			<p>Then score the items or groups. The scoring method you use depends on the sort of problem you are trying to solve. For example, if you are trying to improve profitability, you would score options on the basis of the profit each group might generate. If you are trying to improve customer satisfaction, you might score on the basis of the number of complaints eliminated by each change.</p>
			
			<p>The first change to tackle is the one that has the highest score. This one will give you the biggest benefit if you solve it.</p>
			
			<p>The options with the lowest scores will probably not even be worth bothering with &#8211; solving these problems may cost you more than the solutions are worth.</p>
			
			<h4>Example</h4>
			
			<p>A manager has taken over a failing service center. He commissions research to find out why customers think that service is poor.</p>
			
			<p>He gets the following comments back from the customers:</p>
			
			<ol class="indent-outside">
				<li>Phones are only answered after many rings.</li>
				<li>Staff seem distracted and under pressure.</li>
				<li>Engineers do not appear to be well organized. They need second visits to bring extra parts. This means that customers have to take more holiday to be there a second time.</li>
				<li>They do not know what time they will arrive. This means that customers may have to be in all day for an engineer to visit.</li>
				<li>Staff members do not always seem to know what they are doing.</li>
				<li>Sometimes when staff members arrive, the customer finds that the problem could have been solved over the phone.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>The manager groups these problems together. He then scores each group by the number of complaints, and orders the list:</p>
			
			<ol class="indent-outside">
				<li><em>Lack of staff training:</em> items 5 and 6: 51 complaints.</li>
				<li><em>Too few staff:</em> items 1, 2 and 4: 21 complaints.</li>
				<li><em>Poor organization and preparation:</em> item 3: 2 complaints.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">121</span></div>
			
			<p>By doing the Pareto analysis above, the manager can better see that the vast majority of problems (69%) can be solved by improving staff skills.</p>
			
			<p>Once this is done, it may be worth looking at increasing the number of staff members. Alternatively, as staff members become more able to solve problems over the phone, maybe the need for new staff members may decline.</p>
			
			<p>It looks as if comments on poor organization and preparation may be rare, and could be caused by problems beyond the manager&#39;s control.</p>
			
			<p>By carrying out a Pareto Analysis, the manager is able to focus on training as an issue, rather than spreading effort over training, taking on new staff members, and possibly installing a new computer system.</p>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>Pareto Analysis is a simple technique that helps you to identify the most important problem to solve.</p>
			
			<p>To use it:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>List the problems you face, or the options you have available.</li>
				<li>Group options where they are facets of the same larger problem.</li>
				<li>Apply an appropriate score to each group.</li>
				<li>Work on the group with the highest score.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Pareto analysis not only shows you the most important problem to solve, it also gives you a score showing how severe the problem is.</p>
			
			<p>*This is only one application of this important 80/20 principle. It shows the lack of symmetry that almost always appears between work put in and results achieved. This can be seen in area after area of competitive activity. The figures 80 and 20 are illustrative &#8211; for example, 13% of work could generate 92% of returns. Vilfredo Pareto was an Italian economist who noted that approximately 80% of wealth was owned by only 20% of the population. This was true in almost all the societies he studied.</p>

		<section class="subsection" data-number="3" data-name="Paired Comparison Analysis">
			<h3>Paired Comparison Analysis</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Working out the relative importance of different options</div>
			
			<p class="skimmable">Paired Comparison Analysis helps you to work out the importance of a number of options relative to each other. It is particularly useful where you do not have objective data to base this on.</p>
			
			<p>This makes it easy to choose the most important problem to solve, or select the solution that will give you the greatest advantage. Paired Comparison Analysis helps you to set priorities where there are conflicting demands on your resources.</p>
			
			<p>It is also an ideal tool for comparing &#8216;apples with oranges&#8217; &#8211; completely different options such as whether to invest in marketing, a new IT system or a new piece of machinery. These decisions are usually much harder than comparing three possible new IT systems, for example.</p>
			
			<h4>How to Use the Tool</h4>
			
			<p>To use the technique, first download our free worksheet or get a copy from your Worksheets and Templates Supplement. You can use this to compare each option with each other option, one&#45;by&#45;one. For each comparison, you will decide which of the two options is most important, and then assign a score to show how much more important it is.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">122</span></div>
			
			<p>Follow these steps to use the technique:</p>
			
			<ol class="indent-outside">
				<li>List the options you will compare. Assign a letter to each option.</li>
				<li>Mark the options as row and column headings on the worksheet.</li>
				<li>Note that the cells on the table where you will be comparing an option with itself have been blocked out &#8211; there will never be a difference in these cells!</li>
				<li>The cells on the table where you will be duplicating a comparison are also blocked out.</li>
				<li>Within the remaining cells compare the option in the row with the one in the column. For each cell, decide which of the two options is more important. Write down the letter of the more important option in the cell, and score the difference in importance from 0 (no difference) to 3 (major difference).</li>
				<li>Finally, consolidate the results by adding up the total of all the values for each of the options. You may want to convert these values into a percentage of the total score.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h4>Example</h4>
			
			<p>As a simple example, an entrepreneur is looking at ways in which she can expand her business. She has limited resources, but also has the options she lists below:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Expand into overseas markets</li>
				<li>Expand in home markets</li>
				<li>Improve customer service</li>
				<li>Improve quality</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Firstly she draws up the Paired Comparison Analysis table in Figure 1:</p>
			
			<h5>Figure 1: Example Paired Comparison Analysis Table (not filled in):</h5>
			
			<table class="paired-comparison">
				<tr>
					<th></th>
					<th>Overseas<br>Market &#40;A&#41;</th>
					<th>Home<br>Market &#40;B&#41;</th>
					<th>Customer<br>Service &#40;C&#41;</th>
					<th>Quality<br>&#40;D&#41;</th>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Overseas<br>Market<br>&#40;A&#41;</td>
					<td>Blocked Out<br>(Step 3)</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Home Market<br>&#40;B&#41;</td>
					<td>Blocked Out<br>(Step 4)</td>
					<td>Blocked Out<br>(Step 3)</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Customer<br>Service<br>&#40;C&#41;</td>
					<td>Blocked Out<br>(Step 4)</td>
					<td>Blocked Out<br>(Step 4)</td>
					<td>Blocked<br>Out<br>(Step 3)</td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Quality<br>&#40;D&#41;</td>
					<td>Blocked Out<br>(Step 4)</td>
					<td>Blocked Out<br>(Step 4)</td>
					<td>Blocked<br>Out<br>(Step 4)</td>
					<td>Blocked<br>Out<br>(Step 3)</td>
				</td>
			</table>
			
			<p>Then she compares options, writes down the letter of the most important option, and scores their difference in importance. An example of how she might do this is shown in figure 2:</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">123</span></div>
			
			<h5>Figure 2: Example Paired Comparison Analysis Table (filled in):</h5>
			
			<table class="paired-comparison">
				<tr>
					<th></th>
					<th>Overseas<br>Market &#40;A&#41;</th>
					<th>Home<br>Market &#40;B&#41;</th>
					<th>Customer<br>Service &#40;C&#41;</th>
					<th>Quality<br>&#40;D&#41;</th>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Overseas<br>Market<br>&#40;A&#41;</td>
					<td></td>
					<td>A,2</td>
					<td>C,1</td>
					<td>A,1</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Home Market<br>&#40;B&#41;</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td>C,1</td>
					<td>B,1</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Customer<br>Service<br>&#40;C&#41;</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td>C,2</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Quality<br>&#40;D&#41;</td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
					<td></td>
				</td>
			</table>
			
			<p style="margin-top:0px;">Finally she adds up the A, B, C and D values, and converts each into a percentage of the total. This gives these totals:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>A = 3 (37.5%)</li>
				<li>B = 1 (12.5%)</li>
				<li>C = 4(50%)</li>
				<li>D = 0</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Here it is most important to improve customer service &#40;C&#41; and then to tackle export markets &#40;A&#41;. Quality is not a high priority &#8211; perhaps it is good already.</p>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>Paired Comparison Analysis is a good way of weighing up the relative importance of different courses of action. It is useful where priorities are not clear, or are competing in importance.</p>
			
			<p>The tool provides a framework for comparing each course of action against all others, and helps to show the difference in importance between factors.</p>

		<section class="subsection" data-number="4" data-name="Grid Analysis">
			<h3>Grid Analysis</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Making a choice where many factors must be considered</div>
			
			<p class="skimmable">Grid Analysis (also known as Decision Matrix Analysis, Pugh Matrix Analysis or MAUT, which stands for Multi-Attribute Utility Theory) is a useful technique to use for making a decision.,/p>
			
			<p>It is particularly powerful where you have a number of good alternatives to choose from, and many different factors to take into account. This makes it a great technique to use in almost any important decision where there isn't a clear and obvious preferred option.</p>
			
			<p>Being able to use Grid Analysis means that you can take decisions confidently and rationally, at a time when other people might be struggling to make a decision.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">124</span></div>
			
			<h4>How to Use the Tool</h4>
			
			<p>The technique works by getting you to list your options as rows on a table, and the factors you need consider as columns. You then score each option/factor combination, weight this score, and add these scores up to give an overall score for the option.</p>
			
			<p>While this sounds complex, in reality the technique is quite easy to use. Here's a step-by-step guide with an example.</p>
			
			<p>Start by downloading our free worksheet or take a copy from your Worksheets and Templates Supplement, and then work through these steps:</p>
			
			<ol class="indent-outside">
				<li>The first step is to list all of your options as the row labels on the table, and list the factors that you need to consider as the column headings.</li>
				<li>
					<p>Next, work out the relative importance of the factors in your decision. Show these as numbers from, say, 0 to 5, where 0 means that the factor is absolutely unimportant in the final decision, and 5 means that it is very important. (It&#39;s perfectly acceptable to have factors with the same importance.) We will use these to weight your preferences by the importance of the factor.<p>
					<p>These values may be obvious. If they are not, then use a technique such as Paired Comparison Analysis to estimate them.</p>
				</li>
				<li>The next step is to work your way down the columns of your table, scoring each option for each of the factors in your decision. Score each option from 0 (poor) to 5 (very good). Note that you do not have to have a different score for each option &#8211; if none of them are good for a particular factor in your decision, then all options should score 0.</li>
				<li>Now multiply each of your scores from step 3 by the values for relative importance you calculated in step 2. This will give you weighted scores for each option/factor combination.</li>
				<li>Finally, add up these weighted scores for each of your options. The option that scores the highest wins!</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h4>Example</h4>
			
			<p>A windsurfing enthusiast is about to replace his car. He needs one that not only carries a board and sails, but also that will be good for business travel. He has always loved open-topped sports cars. No car he can find is good for all three things.</p>
			
			<p>His options are:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>An SUV/4x4, hard topped vehicle.</li>
				<li>A comfortable &#8216;family car&#8217;.</li>
				<li>A station wagon/estate car.</li>
				<li>A convertible sports car.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Criteria that he wants to consider are:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Cost.</li>
				<li>Ability to carry a sail board safely.</li>
				<li>Ability to store sails and equipment securely.</li>
				<li>Comfort over long distances.</li>
				<li>Fun!</li>
				<li>Nice look and build quality to car.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">125</span></div>
			
			<p>Firstly he draws up the table shown in Figure 1, and scores each option by how well it satisfies each factor:</p>
			<h5 style="margin-bottom:10px;">Figure 1: Example Grid Analysis Showing Unweighted Assessment of How Each Type of Car Satisfies Each Factor</h5>

			<p>Next he decides the relative weights for each of the factors. He multiplies these by the scores already entered, and totals them. This is shown in Figure 2:</p>

			</table>
			
			<p>This gives an interesting result: Despite its lack of fun, a station wagon may be the best choice.</p>
			
			<p>If the wind&#45;surfer still feels unhappy with the decision, maybe he has underestimated the importance of one of the factors. Perhaps he should give &#8216;fun&#8217; a weight of 7, and buy an old station wagon to carry his board!</p>
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>Grid Analysis helps you to decide between several options, while taking many different factors into account.</p>
			<p>To use the tool, lay out your options as rows on a table. Set up the columns to show your factors. Allocate weights to show the importance of each of these factors. Score each choice for each factor using numbers from 0 (poor) to 5 (very good). Multiply each score by the weight of the factor, to show its contribution to the overall selection. Finally add up the total scores for each option. Select the highest scoring option.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">126</span></div>
			
			<p>Grid Analysis is the simplest form of Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), also known as Multiple Criteria Decision Aid or Multiple Criteria Decision Management (MCDM). Sophisticated MCDA is involves highly complex modeling of different potential scenarios and advanced mathematics.</p>

			<h3>PMI</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Weighing the pros and cons of a decision</div>
			
			<p class="skimmable">PMI stands for &#8216;Plus/Minus/Interesting&#8217;. It is a valuable improvement to the &#8216;weighing pros and cons&#8217; technique used for centuries.</p>
			
			<p>PMI is an important Decision Making tool: The mind tools used so far in this section have focused on selecting a course of action from a range of options. Before you move straight to action on this course of action, it is important to check that it is going to improve the situation (it may actually be best to do nothing!) PMI is a useful tool for doing this.</p>
			
			<h4>How to Use the Tool</h4>
			
			<p>In the column underneath &#8216;Plus&#8217;, write down all the positive results of taking the action. Underneath &#8216;Minus&#8217; write down all the negative effects. In the &#8216;Interesting&#8217; column write down the implications and possible outcomes of taking the action, whether positive, negative, or uncertain.</p>
			
			<p>By this stage it may already be obvious whether or not you should implement the decision. If it is not, consider each of the points you have written down and assign a positive or negative score to it appropriately. The scores you assign may be quite subjective.</p>
			
			<p>Once you have done this, add up the score. A strongly positive score shows that an action should be taken, a strongly negative score that it should be avoided.</p>
			
			<h4>Example</h4>
			
			<p>A young professional is deciding where to live. Her question is &#8216;Should she move to the big city?&#8217; She draws up the PMI table below:</p>
			
			<table class="grid-analysis">
				<tr>
					<th>Plus</th>
					<th>Minus</th>
					<th>Interesting</th>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>More going on (+5)</td>
					<td>Have to sell house (-6)</td>
					<td>Easier to find new job?<br>(+1)</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Easier to see friends<br>(+5)</td>
					<td>More pollution (-3)</td>
					<td>Meet more people?<br>(+2)</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Easier to get places<br>(+3)</td>
					<td>Less space (-3)</td>
					<td>More difficult to get<br>own work done? (-4)</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td></td>
					<td>No countryside (-2)</td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td></td>
					<td>More difficult to get to<br>work? (-4)</td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<th>+13</th>
					<th>-18</th>
					<th>-1</th>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>She scores the table as 13 (Plus) &#8211; 18 (Minus) &#8211; 1 (Interesting) = &#8211; 6</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">127</span></div>
			
			<p>For her, the comforts of a settled rural existence outweigh the call of the ‘bright lights’ – it would be much better for her to live outside the city, but close enough to travel in if necessary.</p>
			
			<p>PMI was codified by Edward de Bono in his book Serious Creativity.</p>

			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>PMI is a good way of weighing the pros, cons and implications of a decision. When you have selected a course of action, PMI is a good technique to use to check that it is worth taking.</p>
			
			<p>To use the technique, draw up a table with three columns headed Plus, Minus and Interesting. Within the table write down all the positive points of following the course of action, all the negatives, and all the interesting implications and possible outcomes.</p>
			
			<p>If the decision is still not obvious, you can then score the table to show the importance of individual items. The total score should show whether it is worth implementing the decision.</p>

			<h3>Force Field Analysis</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Understanding the pressures for and against change</div>
			
			<p class="skimmable">Force Field Analysis is a useful technique for looking at all the forces for and against a decision. In effect, it is a specialized method of weighing pros and cons.</p>
			
			<p>By carrying out the analysis you can plan to strengthen the forces supporting a decision, and reduce the impact of opposition to it.</p>
			
			<h4>How to Use the Tool</h4>
			
			<p>To carry out a force field analysis, first download our free worksheet, or get a copy from your Worksheets and Templates Supplement and then use it to follow these steps:</p>
			
			<ol class="indent-outside">
				<li>Describe your plan or proposal for change in the middle.</li><br>
				<li>List all forces for change in one column, and all forces against change in another column.</li><br>
				<li>Assign a score to each force, from 1 (weak) to 5 (strong).</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>For example, imagine that you are a manager deciding whether to install new manufacturing equipment in your factory. You might draw up a force field analysis like the one in Figure 1:</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">128</span></div>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure1section3.5.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>Once you have carried out an analysis, you can decide whether your project is viable. In the example above, you might initially question whether it is worth going ahead with the plan.</p>
			
			<p>Where you have already decided to carry out a project, Force Field Analysis can help you to work out how to improve its probability of success. Here you have two choices:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>To reduce the strength of the forces opposing a project, or</li>
				<li>To increase the forces pushing a project</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Often the most elegant solution is the first: just trying to force change through may cause its own problems. People can be uncooperative if change is forced on them.</p>
			
			<p>If you had to implement the project in the example above, the analysis might suggest a number of changes to the initial plan:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>By training staff (increase cost by 1) you could eliminate fear of technology (reduce fear by 2)</li>
				<li>It would be useful to show staff that change is necessary for business survival (new force in favor, +2)</li>
				<li>Staff could be shown that new machines would introduce variety and interest to their jobs (new force, +1)</li>
				<li>You could raise wages to reflect new productivity (cost +1, loss of overtime -2)</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">129</span></div>


			<ul>
				<li>Slightly different machines with filters to eliminate pollution could be installed (environmental impact -1)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>These changes would swing the balance from 11:10 (against the plan), to 8:13 (in favor of the plan).</p>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>Force Field Analysis is a useful technique for looking at all the forces for and against a plan. It helps you to weigh the importance of these factors and decide whether a plan is worth implementing.</p>
			
			<p>Where you have decided to carry out a plan, Force Field Analysis helps you identify changes that you could make to improve it.</p>

			<h3>Six Thinking Hats</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Looking at a decision from all points of view</div>
			
			<p class="skimmable">&#8216;Six Thinking Hats&#8217; is a powerful technique that helps you look at important decisions from a number of different perspectives. It helps you make better decisions by pushing you to move outside your habitual ways of thinking. As such, it helps you understand the full complexity of a decision, and spot issues and opportunities which you might otherwise not notice.</p>
			
			<p>Many successful people think from a very rational, positive viewpoint, and this is part of the reason that they are successful. Often, though, they may fail to look at problems from emotional, intuitive, creative or negative viewpoints. This can mean that they underestimate resistance to change, don't make creative leaps, and fail to make essential contingency plans.</p>
			
			<p>Similarly, pessimists may be excessively defensive, and people used to a very logical approach to problem solving may fail to engage their creativity or listen to their intuition.</p>
			
			<p>If you look at a problem using the Six Thinking Hats technique, then you&#39;ll use all of these approaches to develop your best solution. Your decisions and plans will mix ambition, skill in execution, sensitivity, creativity and good contingency planning.</p>
			
			<p>This tool was created by Edward de Bono in his book 6 Thinking Hats</p>
			
			<h4>How to Use the Tool</h4>
			
			<p>To use Six Thinking Hats to improve the quality of your decision&#45;making, look at the decision &#8216;wearing&#8217; each of the thinking hats in turn.</p>
			
			<p>Each &#8216;Thinking Hat&#8217; is a different style of thinking. These are explained below:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>White Hat:</strong><br>With this thinking hat, you focus on the data available. Look at the information you have, and see what you can learn from it. Look for gaps in your knowledge, and either try to fill them or take account of them.
				
					<p>This is where you analyze past trends, and try to extrapolate from historical data.</p>
				</li>				
			</ul>

			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">130</span></div>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Red Hat:</strong><br>Wearing the red hat, you look at the decision using intuition, gut reaction, and emotion. Also try to think how other people will react emotionally, and try to understand the intuitive responses of people who do not fully know your reasoning.</li><br>
				
				<li><strong>Black Hat:</strong><br>When using black hat thinking, look at things pessimistically, cautiously and defensively. Try to see why ideas and approaches might not work. This is important because it highlights the weak points in a plan or course of action. It allows you to eliminate them, alter your approach, or prepare contingency plans to counter problems that arise.
				
					<p>Black Hat thinking helps to make your plans tougher and more resilient. It can also help you to spot fatal flaws and risks before you embark on a course of action. Black Hat thinking is one of the real benefits of this technique, as many successful people get so used to thinking positively that often they cannot see problems in advance, leaving them under- prepared for difficulties.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><strong>Yellow Hat:</strong><br>The yellow hat helps you to think positively. It is the optimistic viewpoint that helps you to see all the benefits of the decision and the value in it, and spot the opportunities that arise from it. Yellow Hat thinking helps you to keep going when everything looks gloomy and difficult.</li><br>
				
				<li><strong>Green Hat:</strong><br>The Green Hat stands for creativity. This is where you can develop creative solutions to a problem. It is a freewheeling way of thinking, in which there is little criticism of ideas. A whole range of creativity tools can help you here.</li><br>
				
				<li><strong>Blue Hat:</strong><br>The Blue Hat stands for process control. This is the hat worn by people chairing meetings. When running into difficulties because ideas are running dry, they may direct activity into Green Hat thinking. When contingency plans are needed, they will ask for Black Hat thinking, and so on.</li><br>
			</ul>
			
			<p>You can use Six Thinking Hats in meetings or on your own. In meetings it has the benefit of defusing the disagreements that can happen when people with different thinking styles discuss the same problem.</p>
			
			<p>A similar approach is to look at problems from the point of view of different professionals (e.g. doctors, architects, sales directors) or different customers.</p>
			
			<h4>Example</h4>
			
			<p>The directors of a property company are looking at whether they should construct a new office building. The economy is doing well, and the amount of vacant office space is reducing sharply. As part of their decision they decide to use the 6 Thinking Hats technique during a planning meeting.</p>
			
			<P>Looking at the problem with the <strong>White Hat</strong>, they analyze the data they have. They examine the trend in vacant office space, which shows a sharp reduction. They anticipate that by the time the office block would be completed, that there will be a severe shortage of office space. Current government projections show steady economic growth for at least the construction period.</p>
			
			<p>With <strong>Red Hat</strong> thinking, some of the directors think the proposed building looks quite ugly. While it would be highly cost&#45;effective, they worry that people would not like to work in it.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">131</span></div>
			
			<p>When they think with the <strong>Black Hat</strong>, they worry that government projections may be wrong. The economy may be about to enter a &#8216;cyclical downturn&#8217;, in which case the office building may be empty for a long time.</p>
			
			<p>If the building is not attractive, then companies will choose to work in another better&#45;looking building at the same rent.</p>
			
			<p>With the <strong>Yellow Hat</strong>, however, if the economy holds up and their projections are correct, the company stands to make a great deal of money.</p>
			
			<p>If they are lucky, maybe they could sell the building before the next downturn, or rent to tenants on long&#45;term leases that will last through any recession.</p>
			
			<p>With <strong>Green Hat</strong> thinking they consider whether they should change the design to make the building more pleasant. Perhaps they could build prestige offices that people would want to rent in any economic climate. Alternatively, maybe they should invest the money in the short term to buy up property at a low cost when a recession comes.</p>
			
			<p>The <strong>Blue Hat</strong> has been used by the meeting&#39;s Chair to move between the different thinking styles. He or she may have needed to keep other members of the team from switching styles, or from criticizing other peoples&#39; points.</p>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>Six Thinking Hats is a good technique for looking at the effects of a decision from a number of different points of view.</p>
			
			<p>It allows necessary emotion and skepticism to be brought into what would otherwise be purely rational decisions. It opens up the opportunity for creativity within Decision Making. It also helps, for example, persistently pessimistic people to be positive and creative.</p>
			
			<p>Plans developed using the &#8216;6 Thinking Hats&#8217; technique are sounder and more resilient than would otherwise be the case. This technique may also help you to avoid public relations mistakes, and spot good reasons not to follow a course of action, before you have committed to it.</p>

		<section class="subsection" data-number="8" data-name="Starbursting">
			<h3>Starbursting</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Understanding new ideas by brainstorming questions</div>
			
			<p>When a colleague suggests a new product or idea, and you're trying to understand it and how it works, a typical response is to bombard the other person with questions. What features would it have? How much would it cost? Where would we market it? Who would be responsible for it? Who would buy it? Why would they buy it? And so on.</p>
			
			<p>Asking questions like these is a valuable way of understanding the new idea, and of challenging it to ensure that all of the relevant aspects of it have been considered before any work begins on implementing it. To get the most out of this approach, it's important that the questions asked are systematic and comprehensive. After all, there would be no point identifying every feature and the intended customers of a new product, and starting to manufacture it if you haven't asked how you would bring it to that market.</p>
			
			<p>So it's worth going through a comprehensive, systematic questioning exercise every time you explore a new idea. The Starbursting technique is useful way of going about this.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">132</span></div>
			
			<p>Starbursting is a form of brainstorming that focuses on generating questions rather than answers. It can be used iteratively, with further layers of questioning about the answers to the initial set of questions. For example, a colleague suggests a new design of ice skating boot. One question you ask might be &#8216;Who is the customer?&#8217; Answer: skaters. But you need to go further than this to ensure that you target your promotions accurately: &#8216;What kind of skaters?&#8217; Answer: those who do a lot of jumping, who need extra support, and so on. This would help focus the marketing, for example to competition ice dancers and figure skaters, rather than ice rinks that buy boots to hire out to the general public.</p>
			
			<h4>How to Use the Tool</h4>
			
			<p>The best way to see the power of this simple but effective technique is to think of a product, challenge or issue to work on, and follow these steps:</p>
			
			<table class="steps">
				<tr>
					<td>Step 1</td>
					<td>Download our free worksheet, or take a copy from your Worksheets and Templates Supplement and print it out or take a large sheet of paper, draw a large six-pointed star in the middle, and write your idea, product or challenge in the centre.</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Step 2</td>
					<td>Write the words Who, What, Why, Where, When and How at the tip of each point of the star.</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Step 3</td>
					<td>Brainstorm questions about the idea or product starting with each of these words. The questions radiate out from the central star. Don't try to answer any of the questions as you go along. Instead, concentrate on thinking up as many questions as you can.</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Step 4</td>
					<td>Depending on the scope of the exercise, you may want to have further starbursting sessions to explore the answers to these initial questions further.</td>
				</tr>

		<section class="subsection" data-number="9" data-name="Stepladder Technique">
			<h3>Stepladder Technique</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Making better group decisions</div>
			
			<p>Making decisions within a group can often be challenging. When things go well, they can go very well. However, when things go wrong, you can end up mired in conflict. Some people may fight for recognition and position, others may be over-critical or disruptive, while others may sit quietly and not contribute anything to the overall effort. Because of this, groups can often spin out of control and make worse decisions than individuals working on their own.</p>
			
			<p>When this happens, it&#39;s easy to see why some people throw their hands up in frustration and give up. However, when a group works in the right way, it really WORKS. Groups that function effectively together can outperform individuals and make much better decisions.</p>
			
			<p>But how do you make your group effective? How do you get all the members to contribute and inspire one another to create great ideas and solutions?</p>
			
			<p>The Stepladder Technique is a useful method for encouraging individual participation in group decision making.</p>
			
			<h4>What is the Stepladder Technique?</h4>
			
			<p>The Stepladder Technique is a simple tool that manages how members enter the decision&#45;making group. Developed by Steven Rogelberg, Janet Barnes&#45;Farrell and Charles Lowe in 1992, it encourages all members to contribute on an individual level BEFORE being influenced by anyone else. This results in a wider variety of ideas, it prevents people from &#8216;hiding&#8217; within the group, and it helps people avoid being &#8216;stepped on&#8217; or overpowered by stronger, louder group members.</p>
			
			<p>All of this helps the group make better decisions.</p>
			
			<h4>How to Use the Tool</h4>
			
			<p>The Stepladder Technique has five basic steps. Here&#39;s how it works.</p>
			
			<table class="steps">
				<tr>
					<td>Step 1:</td>
					<td>Before getting together as a group, present the task or problem to all members. Give everyone sufficient time to think about what needs to be done and to form their own opinions on how to best accomplish the task or solve the problem.</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Step 2:</td>
					<td>Form a core group of two members. Have them discuss the problem.</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Step 3:</td>
					<td>Add a third group member to the core group. The third member presents ideas to the first two members BEFORE hearing the ideas that have already been discussed. After all three members have laid out their solutions and ideas, they discuss their options together.</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Step 4:</td>
					<td>Repeat the same process by adding a fourth member, and so on, to the group. Allow time for discussion after each additional member has presented his or her ideas.</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>Step 5:</td>
					<td>Reach a final decision only after all members have been brought in and presented their ideas.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">135</span></div>
			
			<div class="grey-background">
			
				<p><strong>Tip 1:</strong><br>			
				The Stepladder Technique is similar to the Delphi Method, another tool that&#39;s often used in groups to prevent Groupthink and to encourage participation. While both tools have the same objective, they differ in a few key ways:</p>
			
				<ul>
					<li>In the Delphi Method, an objective facilitator or leader manages the group. In the Stepladder Technique, all members are equal.</li>
					<li>The Delphi Method keeps members anonymous. The facilitator manages the flow of information, and members may have no idea who else is in the group. The Stepladder Technique involves face-to-face meetings, so everyone knows who the other members are.</li>
					<li>The Delphi Method is a lengthy process, while the Stepladder Technique is much quicker.</li>
				</ul>
			
				<p>The Delphi Method is often used for major decisions that need input from a large number of people. The Stepladder Technique works best with smaller groups that make a wide range of decisions.</p>
			
				<p><strong>Tip 2:</strong><br>			
				Many groups can begin to lose their effectiveness and ability to make quality decisions if they have too many members. Keep your group small &#8211; four to six team members &#8211; to maximize effectiveness.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>The Stepladder Technique is a step&#45;by&#45;step approach to help ensure that all members of a group participate and are heard. The technique allows shy, quiet people to present their ideas before other group members can influence them, and it allows everyone to hear many different viewpoints before reaching a final decision.</p>

		<section class="subsection" data-number="10" data-name="Cost/Benefit Analysis">
			<h3>Cost/Benefit Analysis</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Evaluating quantitatively whether to follow a course of action</div>
			
			<p>You may have been intensely creative in generating solutions to a problem, and rigorous in your selection of the best one available. However, this solution may still not be worth implementing, as you may invest a lot of time and money in solving a problem that is not worthy of this effort.</p>
			
			<p>Cost Benefit Analysis or cba is a relatively* simple and widely used technique for deciding whether to make a change. As its name suggests, you simply add up the value of the benefits of a course of action, and subtract the costs associated with it.</p>
			
			<p>Costs are either one&#45;off, or may be ongoing. Benefits are most often received over time. We build this effect of time into our analysis by calculating a payback period. This is the time it takes for the benefits of a change to repay its costs. Many companies look for payback on projects over a specified period of time e.g. three years.</p>
			
			<h4>How to Use the Tool</h4>
			
			<p>In its simple form, cost&#45;benefit analysis is carried out using only financial costs and financial benefits. For example, a simple cost benefit ratio for a road scheme would measure the cost of building the road, and subtract this from the economic benefit of improving transport links. It would not measure either the cost of environmental damage or the benefit of quicker and easier travel to work.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">136</span></div>
			
			A more sophisticated approach to building a cost benefit models is to try to put a financial value on intangible costs and benefits. This can be highly subjective &#8211; is, for example, a historic water meadow worth $25,000, or is it worth $500,000 because if its environmental importance? What is the value of stress-free travel to work in the morning?</p>
			
			<p>These are all questions that people have to answer, and answers that people have to defend.</p>
			
			<p>The version of the cost benefit approach we explain here is necessarily simple. Where large sums of money are involved (for example, in financial market transactions), project evaluation can become an extremely complex and sophisticated art. The fundamentals of this are explained in Principles of Corporate Finance by Richard Brealey and Stewart Myers &#8211; this is something of an authority on the subject.</p>
			
			<h4>Example</h4>
			
			<p>A sales director is deciding whether to implement a new computer-based contact management and sales processing system. His department has only a few computers, and his salespeople are not computer literate. He is aware that computerized sales forces are able to contact more customers and give a higher quality of reliability and service to those customers. They are more able to meet commitments, and can work more efficiently with fulfilment and delivery staff.</p>
			
			<p>His financial cost/benefit analysis is shown below:</p>
			
			<h5><em>Costs:</em></h5>
			
			<p>New computer equipment:</p>
			
			<p>10 network-ready PCs with supporting software @ $2,450 each</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>1 server &#64; &#36;3,500</li>
				<li>3 printers &#64; &#36;1,200 each</li>
				<li>Cabling & Installation &#64; &#36;4,600</li>
				<li>Sales Support Software &#64; &#36;15,000</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Training costs:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Computer introduction &#8211; 8 people &#64; &#36;400 each</li>
				<li>Keyboard skills &#8211; 8 people &#64; &#36;400 each</li>
				<li>Sales Support System &#8211; 12 people &#64; &#36;700 each</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Other costs:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Lost time: 40 man days &#64; &#36;200 / day</li>
				<li>Lost sales through disruption: estimate: &#36;20,000</li>
				<li>Lost sales through inefficiency during first months: estimate: &#36;20,000</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Total cost: &#36;114,000</p>
			
			<h5><em>Benefits:</em></h5>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Tripling of mail shot capacity: estimate: &#36;40,000 / year</li>
				<li>Ability to sustain telesales campaigns: estimate: &#36;20,000 / year</li>
				<li>Improved efficiency and reliability of follow-up: estimate: &#36;50,000 / year</li>
				<li>Improved customer service and retention: estimate: &#36;30,000 / year</li>
				<li>Improved accuracy of customer information: estimate: &#36;10,000 / year</li>
				<li>More ability to manage sales effort: &#36;30,000 / year</li>
			</ul>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">137</span></div>
			
			<p>Total Benefit: &#36;180,000/year</p>
			
			<p>Payback time: &#36;114,000 / &#36;180,000 = 0.63 of a year = approx. 8 months</p>
			
			<div class="grey-background">
				<p><strong>Tip:</strong><br>
				The payback time is often known as the break even point. Sometimes this is is more important than the overall benefit a project can deliver, for example because the organization has had to borrow to fund a new piece of machinery. The break even point can be found graphically by plotting costs and income on a graph of output quantity against &#36;. Break even occurs at the point the two lines cross.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>Inevitably the estimates of the benefit given by the new system are quite subjective. Despite this, the Sales Director is very likely to introduce it, given the short payback time.</p>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>Cost/Benefit Analysis is a powerful, widely used and relatively easy tool for deciding whether to make a change.</p>
			
			<p>To use the tool, firstly work out how much the change will cost to make. Then calculate the benefit you will from it.</p>
			
			<p>Where costs or benefits are paid or received over time, work out the time it will take for the benefits to repay the costs.</p>
			
			<p>Cost/Benefit Analysis can be carried out using only financial costs and financial benefits. You may, however, decide to include intangible items within the analysis. As you must estimate a value for these, this inevitably brings an element of subjectivity into the process.</p>
			
			<p>*Larger projects are evaluated using formal finance/capital budgeting, which takes into account many of the complexities involved with financial Decision Making. This is a complex area and is beyond the scope of Mind Tools.</p>

			<h3>Cash Flow Forecasting</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Forecasting the viability of a financial decision</div>
			
			<p>Cash Flow forecasts help you to build a model of the way in which cash moves within a project or organization. They help you to predict whether the sales or income you forecast will cover the costs of operation. They also allow you to analyze whether a project will be sufficiently profitable to justify the effort put into it.</p>
			
			<p>Cash flow forecasts can also be useful for analyzing your own personal finances. This is useful when you are about to make difficult financial decisions.</p>
			
			<p>By carrying out a Cash Flow forecast on a spreadsheet package you can investigate the impact of changing factors within the forecast. If you have structured the spreadsheet correctly then you will be able to see, more or less instantly, the effect that changes will have.</p>
			
			<p>Normally we structure Cash Flow Forecasts in a standard way. This is explained below. Other sorts of forecasting can be carried out with spreadsheets. A good way of structuring these is to firstly analyse the system being forecasted with a system diagram. This system diagram will show the relationships between factors. You can then quantify these relationships, and build a model based on them. The structure of the model will depend on the system being modeled.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">138</span></div>
			
			<h4>How to Use the Tool</h4>
			
			<p>We structure the Cash Flow Forecast as a table. On the table we have columns for each period (normally a month) within the forecast. Rows show individual cash movements such as sales of a product, sales costs, and particular expenses.</p>
			
			<p>We create the table for the forecast in three stages. Refer to the example in Figure 1 (below) as we run through the stages:</p>
			
			<h5 style="margin-bottom:0px;"><em>1. Set Up Column Headings:</em></h5>
			
			<p>Decide the period of time over which you want to run your forecast, and the length of the periods within it. Typically the forecast will run over 1&#45;2 years, with the periods as months.</p>
			
			<p>Head up one column with the title &#8216;Cash Movement&#8217;. Then enter the periods of the forecast as the next column headings.</p>
			
			<p>This will give you column headings of, for example, Cash Movement, January, February, March, April, etc.</p>
			
			<h5 style="margin-bottom:0px;"><em>2. Set Up Row Titles:</em></h5>
			
			<p>We organize rows into three main groups:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Income:</strong></li>
				
				<p style="margin-top:0px;">These rows show income expected during the period. Set up a separate row for each source of income. Examples might be:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Sales of ABC product</li>
					<li>Sales of BCD service</li>
					<li>Investment income</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Where costs of operation are directly dependent on the amount sold, you may decide to deduct the direct cost of the sales made within this group of rows. Put in a subtotal at the bottom of the group.</p>
				
				<li><strong>Outgoings:</strong></li>
				
				<p style="margin-top:0px;">These rows show all of your costs, itemized by the type of cost. Examples might be:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Staff salaries</li>
					<li>Payroll taxes</li>
					<li>Stationery</li>
					<li>Telephones</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Set up a subtotal at the bottom of this group.</p>
				
				<li><strong>Totals:</strong></li>
				
				<p style="margin-top:0px;">The next row shows the total of the income rows minus the total of the out-going rows for the month. This shows you your profit or loss for the month.</p>
				
				<p>Underneath this, put in a running total. In this row add your profit or loss for the period to the previous running total. This shows your financial position at the end of the period.</p>
			</ul>
				
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">139</span></div>
				
			<h5 style="margin-bottom:0px;"><em>3. Estimate values:</em></h5>
				
			<p>By now you should have a table marked out with column headings and row titles. Now fill in the values of the cells on your table. An easy way of doing this is to fill in the first column, and then use the spreadsheet &#8216;Fill&#8230; Right&#8217; function to copy values across. Then adjust values in the other columns appropriately.</p>
			
			<p>When you are entering projections for sales for a new business, bear in mind you will not sell much until your customers have seen mention of your business several times (often 6 or 7 times). Your estimates for sales will be much more reliable if you base them either on previous years&#39; revenues, on trial marketing, or on good quality market research.</p>
				
			<p>When you are entering values for costs, try, where possible, to base projections on costs from previous years. If this is not possible, base your estimates on real prices quoted. This keeps your estimates as realistic as possible.</p>

			<h5 style="margin-bottom:0px;"><em>4. Calculate!</em></h5>
				
			<p>On most modern spreadsheet packages this will happen automatically, providing you have set up totals correctly as described in section 2. As you enter and change the values of cells within the spreadsheet, you should see that the period totals and running totals change appropriately.</p>
				
			<p>Cash Flow Forecasting is a relatively simple technique for checking the viability of a project. Cost/Benefit Analysis is another. These are good techniques for decisions involving relatively small amounts of money. Where large sums are involved (for example, in financial market transactions), project evaluation can become a complex and sophisticated art, which uses more formal techniques. The fundamentals of this are explained in Principles of Corporate Finance by Richard Brealey and Stewart Myers &#8211; this is something of an authority on the subject. The book is reviewed at the top of our right hand side bar.</p>
			
		
			<h4>Example</h4>
			
			<p>A motor home enthusiast has decided that he wants to set up a motor home hire company. He has researched the costs of set up, and estimated the number of weeks of hire he can sell during the year.</p>
			
			<p>Note that he has been quite optimistic in hoping to sell all the weeks of holiday available during the high season of July and August. He will charge the same price as his competitors for a holiday.</p>
			
			<p>He works out the cash flow forecast below:</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">140</span></div>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/cashFlowForecast.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p><em>&#40;Please note that these figures are provided for illustration only and are not necessarily indicative of the real figures for this type of business.&#41;</em></p>
			
			<p>Looking at these figures, the enthusiast is very worried &#8211; although the business scheme he wants to set up will return a small profit of just under &#36;10,000 at the end of the year, he will be nearly &#36;18,000 in the red at the end of March. Unless he has this amount of spare cash of his own and is prepared to tie it up in the venture, or he is willing to arrange a loan or overdraft facility &#40;which will incur further costs&#41;, his proposed business model is not viable.</p>
			
			<p>He may just have saved a lot of time, money and stress by using a Cash Flow Forecast.</p>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>Cash Flow Forecasts are important tools for investigating whether a project or business is viable. They allow you to experiment with changing factors, to see the impact that this will have. Spreadsheet packages are invaluable for cash flow forecasting.</p>
			
			<p>We set up Cash Flow Forecasts in the following stages:</p>
			
			<ol class="indent-outside">
				<li>Setting out column headings for periods (normally months) during the forecast.</li><br>
				<li>Setting out three main groups of rows:</li><br>

					<li>Expenditure rows, with a subtotal</li>
					<li>Period total and running total rows</li>
				</ul><br>
				
				<li>Entering values within cells: Ideally you should do this from real data, or from formal market research information. If this is not possible, then you will have to use the best estimates you can make.</li><br>

			<h3>Decision Tree Analysis</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Choosing between options by projecting likely outcomes</div>
			
			<p>Decision Trees are useful tools for helping you to choose between several courses of action.</p>
			
			<p>They provide a highly effective structure within which you can explore options, and investigate the possible outcomes of choosing those options. They also help you to form a balanced picture of the risks and rewards associated with each possible course of action.</p>
			
			<p>This makes them particularly useful for choosing between different strategies, projects or investment opportunities, particularly when your resources are limited.</p>
			
			<h4>How to Use the Tool</h4>
			
			<p>You start a Decision Tree with a decision that you need to make. Draw a small square to represent this on the left hand side of a large piece of paper, half way down the page.</p>
			
			<p>From this box draw out lines towards the right for each possible solution, and write a short description of the solution along the line. Keep the lines apart as far as possible so that you can expand your thoughts.</p>
			
			<p>At the end of each line, consider the results. If the result of taking that decision is uncertain, draw a small circle. If the result is another decision that you need to make, draw another square. Squares represent decisions, and circles represent uncertain outcomes. Write the decision or factor above the square or circle. If you have completed the solution at the end of the line, just leave it blank.</p>
			
			<p>Starting from the new decision squares on your diagram, draw out lines representing the options that you could select. From the circles draw lines representing possible outcomes. Again make a brief note on the line saying what it means. Keep on doing this until you have drawn out as many of the possible outcomes and decisions as you can see leading on from the original decisions.</p>
			
			<p>An example of the sort of thing you will end up with is shown in Figure 1:</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">142</span></div>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure1section3.11.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>Once you have done this, review your tree diagram. Challenge each square and circle to see if there are any solutions or outcomes you have not considered. If there are, draw them in. If necessary, redraft your tree if parts of it are too congested or untidy. You should now have a good understanding of the range of possible outcomes of your decisions.</p>
			
			<h4>Evaluating Your Decision Tree</h4>
			
			<p>Now you are ready to evaluate the decision tree. This is where you can work out which option has the greatest worth to you. Start by assigning a cash value or score to each possible outcome. Make your best assessment of how much you think it would be worth to you if that outcome came about.</p>
			
			<p>Next look at each circle (representing an uncertainty point) and estimate the probability of each outcome. If you use percentages, the total must come to 100% at each circle. If you use fractions, these must add up to 1. If you have data on past events you may be able to make rigorous estimates of the probabilities. Otherwise write down your best guess.</p>
			
			<p>This will give you a tree like the one shown in Figure 2:</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">143</span></div>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure2section3.11.png">
			</figure>
			
			<h4>Calculating Tree Values</h4>
			
			<p>Once you have worked out the value of the outcomes, and have assessed the probability of the outcomes of uncertainty, it is time to start calculating the values that will help you make your decision.</p>
			
			<p>Start on the right hand side of the decision tree, and work back towards the left. As you complete a set of calculations on a node (decision square or uncertainty circle), all you need to do is to record the result. You can ignore all the calculations that lead to that result from then on.</p>
			
			<h4>Calculating the Value of Uncertain Outcome Nodes</h4>
			
			<p>Where you are calculating the value of uncertain outcomes (circles on the diagram), do this by multiplying the value of the outcomes by their probability. The total for that node of the tree is the total of these values.</p>
			
			<p>In the example in Figure 2, the value for &#8216;new product, thorough development&#8217; is:</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">144</span></div>
			
			<table class="decision-tree">
				<tr>
					<td>0.4 &#40;probability good outcome&#41; x &#36;1,000,000 &#40;value&#41; =</td>
					<td>&#36;400,000</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>0.4 &#40;probability moderate outcome&#41; x &#36;50,000 &#40;value&#41; =</td>
					<td>&#36;20,000</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>0.2 &#40;probability poor outcome&#41; x &#36;2,000 &#40;value&#41; =</td>
					<td>&#36;400</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>&#43;</td>
					<td>&#36;420,400</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Figure 3 shows the calculation of uncertain outcome nodes:</p>
			
			<figure style="margin-left:0;">
				<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure3section3.11.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>Note that the values calculated for each node are shown in the boxes.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">145</span></div>
			
			<h4>Calculating the Value of Decision Nodes</h4>
			
			<p>When you are evaluating a decision node, write down the cost of each option along each decision line. Then subtract the cost from the outcome value that you have already calculated. This will give you a value that represents the benefit of that decision.</p>
			
			<p>Note that amounts already spent do not count for this analysis &#8211; these are &#8216;sunk costs&#8217; and (despite the emotional cost) should not be factored into the decision.</p>
			
			<p>When you have calculated these decision benefits, choose the option that has the largest benefit, and take that as the decision made. This is the value of that decision node.</p>
			
			<p>Figure 4 shows this calculation of decision nodes in our Example</p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure4section3.11.png">
			</figure>
			
			<p>In this example, the benefit we previously calculated for &#8216;new product, thorough development&#8217; was &#36;420,400. We estimate the future cost of this approach as &#36;150,000. This gives a net benefit of &#36;270,400.</p>
			
			<p>The net benefit of &#8216;new product, rapid development&#8217; was &#36;31,400. On this branch we therefore choose the most valuable option, &#8216;new product, thorough development&#8217;, and allocate this value to the decision node.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">146</span></div>
			
			<h4>Result</h4>
			
			<p>By applying this technique we can see that the best option is to develop a new product. It is worth much more to us to take our time and get the product right, than to rush the product to market. And it&#39;s better just to improve our existing products than to botch a new product, even though it costs us less.</p>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>Decision trees provide an effective method of decision making because they:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Clearly lay out the problem so that all options can be challenged.</li>
				<li>Allow us to analyze the possible consequences of a decision fully.</li>
				<li>Provide a framework to quantify the values of outcomes and the probabilities of achieving them.</li>
				<li>Help us to make the best decisions on the basis of existing information and best guesses.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>As with all Decision Making methods, decision tree analysis should be used in conjunction with common sense &#8211; decision trees are just one important part of your Decision Making tool kit.</p>
