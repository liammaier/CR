		<em>
			<p>&#8216;At the age of seven, a young boy and his family were forced out of their home. The boy had to work to support his family. At the age of nine, his mother passed away. When he grew up, the young man was keen to go to law school, but had no education.</p>
		
			<p>At 22, he lost his job as a store clerk. At 23, he ran for state legislature and lost. The same year, he went into business. It failed, leaving him with a debt that took him 17 years to repay. At 27, he had a nervous breakdown.</p>
		
			<p>Two years later, he tried for the post of speaker in his state legislature. He lost. At 31, he was defeated in his attempt to become an elector. By 35, he had been defeated twice while running for Congress. Finally, he did manage to secure a brief term in Congress, but at 39 he lost his re&#45; election bid.</p>
		
			<p>At 41, his four&#45;year&#45;old son died. At 42, he was rejected as a prospective land officer. At 45, he ran for the Senate and lost. Two years later, he lost the vice presidential nomination. At 49, he ran for Senate and lost again. At 51, he was elected the President of the United States of America.&#8211;</p>

		<p>Many of us are acquainted with this eloquent example of persistence and determination in achieving victory. We read it, stop for a moment and then sigh and say: &#8216;Wow! That&#39;s the stuff real leaders are made off.&#8217;</p>
		
		<p>And in saying this, it&#39;s all too easy for us to think about leaders like Lincoln almost as &#8216;mythological creatures&#8217;, separate from the rest of humanity and empowered by some mysterious quality that smoothes their path towards inevitable success. This is the view of leadership that many people have traditionally taken: That leaders are marked out for leadership from early on in their lives, and that if you&#39;re not a leader, there&#39;s little that you can do to become one.</p>
		
		<p>However, that&#39;s not the way we see it now. The modern view is that through patience, persistence and hard work, you can be a highly effective leader.</p>
		
		<p>This section of Mind Tools helps you make a start in finding and developing these leadership qualities within yourself</p>
		
		<p>Our first tools explore different approaches to leadership: the Blake Mouton Managerial Grid allows you to assess how you balance concern for your team with concern for production. We then look at Winning Expert Power, one of the profoundly honest sources of strength and power that you can draw on as a leader, before moving on to consider the different Leadership Styles that you could adopt.</p>
		
		<p>The people skills that come from having good Emotional Intelligence are the subject of our next article. This leads into a set of tools on team dynamics including a Team Effectiveness Assessment to help you identify how well you and your team are working together right now, as well as the core skill of Delegating.</p>
		
		<p>Leaders also need to understand what motivates the people working for them, so we look at Herzberg's Motivators and Hygiene Factors, amongst other tools.</p>
		
		<p>Finally, we explain the important skill of Conflict Resolution.</p>

			<h3>Blake Mouton Managerial Grid</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Balancing task&#45; and people&#45;oriented leadership</div>
			
			<p>When your boss puts you in charge of organizing the company Christmas party, what do you do first? Do you develop a time line and start assigning tasks or do you think about who would prefer to do what and try to schedule around their needs? When the planning starts to fall behind schedule, what is your first reaction? Do you chase everyone to get back on track, or do you ease off a bit recognizing that everyone is busy just doing his/her job, let alone the extra tasks you've assigned?</p>
			
			<p>Your answers to these types of questions can reveal a great deal about your personal leadership style.</p>
			
			<p>Some leaders are very task&#45;oriented; they simply want to get things done. Others are very people&#45;oriented; they want people to be happy. And others are a combination of the two. If you prefer to lead by setting and enforcing tight schedules, you tend to be more production-oriented (or task&#45;oriented). If you make people your priority and try to accommodate employee needs, then you're more people-oriented.</p>
			
			<p>Neither preference is right or wrong, just as no one type of leadership style is best for all situations. However, it's useful to understand what your natural leadership tendencies are, so that you can then working on developing skills that you may be missing.</p>
			
			<p>A popular framework for thinking about a leader&#39;s &#8216;task versus person&#8217; orientation was developed by Robert Blake and Jane Mouton in the early 1960s. Called the Managerial Grid, or Leadership Grid, it plots the degree of task-centeredness versus person-centeredness and identifies five combinations as distinct leadership styles.</p>
			
			<h4>Understanding the Model</h4>
			
			<p>The Managerial Grid is based on two behavioral dimensions:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Concern for People</strong> &#8211; This is the degree to which a leader considers the needs of team members, their interests, and areas of personal development when deciding how best to accomplish a task.</li>
					<li><strong>Concern for Production</strong> &#8211; This is the degree to which a leader emphasizes concrete objectives, organizational efficiency and high productivity when deciding how best to accomplish a task.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>Using the axis to plot leadership &#8216;concerns for production&#8217; versus &#8216;concerns for people&#8217;, Blake and Mouton defined the following five leadership styles:</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">10</span></div>
			
			<figcaption>

			</figure>
			
			<ul class="writing-space">
				<li><strong>Country Club Leadership</strong> &#8211; High People/Low Production</li>
					<p>This style of leader is most concerned about the needs and feelings of members of his/her team. These people operate under the assumption that as long as team members are happy and secure then they will work hard. What tends to result is a work environment that is very relaxed and fun but where production suffers due to lack of direction and control.</p>
					
				<li><strong>Produce or Perish Leadership</strong> &#8211; High Production/Low People</li>
					<p>Also known as Authoritarian or Compliance Leaders, people in this category believe that employees are simply a means to an end. Employee needs are always secondary to the need for efficient and productive workplaces. This type of leader is very autocratic, has strict work rules, policies, and procedures, and views punishment as the most effective means to motivate employees. (See also our article on Theory X/Theory Y.)</p>
					
				<li><strong>Impoverished Leadership</strong> &#8211; Low Production/ Low People</li>
					<p>This leader is mostly ineffective. He/she has neither a high regard for creating systems for getting the job done, nor for creating a work environment that is satisfying and motivating. The result is a place of disorganization, dissatisfaction and disharmony.</p>
					
				<li><strong>Middle-of-the-Road Leadership</strong> &#8211; Medium Production/Medium People</li>
					<p>This style seems to be a balance of the two competing concerns. It may at first appear to be an ideal compromise. Therein lies the problem, though: When you compromise, you necessarily give away a bit of each concern so that neither production nor people needs are fully met. Leaders who use this style settle for average performance and often believe that this is the most anyone can expect.</p>
					
				<li><strong>Team Leadership</strong> &#8211; High Production/High People</li>
					<p>According to the Blake Mouton model, this is the pinnacle of managerial style. These leaders stress production needs and the needs of the people equally highly. The premise here is that employees are involved in understanding organizational purpose and determining production needs. When employees are committed to, and have a stake in the organization's success, their needs and production needs coincide. This creates a team environment based on trust and respect, which leads to high satisfaction and motivation and, as a result, high production. (See also our article on Theory Y.)</p>
			</ul>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">11</span></div>
			
			<h4>Applying the Blake Mouton Managerial Grid</h4>
			
			<p>Being aware of the various approaches is the first step in understanding and improving how well you perform as a manager. It is important to understand how you currently operate, so that you can then identify ways of becoming competent in both realms.</p>
			
			<h5>Step One: Identify your leadership style.</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Think of some recent situations where you were the leader.</li>
					<li>For each of these situations, place yourself in the grid according to where you believe you fit.</li>
				</ul>
			
			
			<h5>Step Two: Identify areas of improvement and develop your leadership skills</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Look at your current leadership method and critically analyze its effectiveness.</li>
					<li>Look at ways you can improve. Are you settling for &#8216;middle of the road&#8217; because it is easier than reaching for more?</li>
					<li>Identify ways to get the skills you need to reach the Team Leadership position. These may include involving others in problem solving or improving how you communicate with them, if you feel you are too task-oriented. Or it may mean becoming clearer about scheduling or monitoring project progress if you tend to focus too much on people.</li>
					<li>Continually monitor your performance and watch for situations when you slip back into bad old habits.</li>
				</ul>
			
			
			<h5>Step Three: Put the Grid in Context</h5>
			
				<p>It is important to recognize that the Team Leadership style isn&#39;t always the most effective approach in every situation. While the benefits of democratic and participative management are universally accepted, there are times that call for more attention in one area than another. If your company is in the midst of a merger or some other significant change, it is often acceptable to place a higher emphasis on people than on production. Likewise, when faced with an economic hardship or physical risk, people concerns may be placed on the back burner, for the short-term at least, to achieve high productivity and efficiency.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">12</span></div>
			
			<div class="grey-background">
				<p>
					<strong>Note:</strong><br>
					Theories of leadership have moved on a certain amount since the Blake Mouton Grid was originally proposed. In particular, the context in which leadership occurs is now seen as an important driver of the leadership style used.
				</p>
				
				<p>And in many situations, the &#8216;Team Leader&#8217; as an ideal has moved to the ideal of the &#8216;Transformational Leader&#8217;: Someone who, according to leadership researcher Bernard Bass:
					<ul>
						<li>Is a model of integrity and fairness.</li>
						<li>Sets clear goals.</li>
						<li>Has high expectations.</li>
						<li>Encourages.</li>
						<li>Provides support and recognition.</li>
						<li>Stirs people&#39;s emotions.</li>
						<li>Gets people to look beyond their self&#45;interest.</li>
						<li>Inspires people to reach for the improbable.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				
				<p>So use Blake Mouton as a helpful model, but don't treat it as an &#8216;eternal truth&#8217;.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>The Blake Mouton Managerial Grid is a practical and useful framework that helps you think about your leadership style. By plotting &#8216;concern for production&#8217; against &#8216;concern for people&#8217;, the grid highlights how placing too much emphasis in one area at the expense of the other leads to low overall productivity.</p>
			
			<p>The model proposes that when both people and production concerns are high, employee engagement and productivity increases accordingly. This is often true, and it follows the ideas of Theories X and Y, and other participative management theories.</p>
			
			<p>While the grid does not entirely address the complexity of &#8216;Which leadership style is best?&#8217;, it certainly provides an excellent starting place to critically analyze your own performance and improve your general leadership skills.</p>

			<h3>The Leadership Motivation Assessment</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">How motivated are you to lead?</div>
			
			<p>The first and most basic prerequisite for leadership is the desire to lead. After all, becoming an effective leader takes hard work. If you're not prepared to work hard at developing your leadership skills or if, deep down, you&#39;re really not sure whether you want to lead or not, you&#39;ll struggle to become an effective leader.</p>

			<h3>Winning Expert Power</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Leading from the front</div>
			
			<p>There are many different power bases that a leader can develop and use.</p>
			
			<p>These include problematic ones such as the power of position, the power to give rewards, the power to punish and the power to control information. While these types of power do have some strength, they put the person being led in an unhealthy position of weakness, and can leave leaders using these power bases looking autocratic and out of touch.</p>
			
			<p>More than this, society has changed hugely over the last 50 years. Citizens are individually more powerful, and employees are more able to shift jobs. Few of us enjoy having power exerted over us, and many will do what they can to undermine people who use these sorts of power.</p>
			
			<p>However there are three types of positive power that effective leaders use: charismatic power, expert power and referent power.</p>
			
			<p>This article teaches you how to build expert power.</p>
			
			<h4>How to Use the Tool</h4>
			
			<p>Expert power is essential because as a leader, your team looks to you for direction and guidance. Team members need to believe in your ability to lead in a worthwhile direction, give sound guidance, and co-ordinate a good result.</p>
			
			<p>If members of your team see you as a true expert, they will be much more receptive when you try to persuade them to do something, and when you want to inspire them to make more of an effort.</p>
			
			<p>And if they see you as an expert, you'll find it much easier to motivate them:
				<ul>
					<li>If team members respect your expertise, they'll trust you to show them how to work effectively.</li>
					<li>If team members respect your judgment, they'll trust you to guide their efforts in such a way that you'll make the most of their hard work.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">15</span></div>
			
			<ul>
				<li>If they can see your expertise, they'll believe that you have the wisdom to direct their efforts towards a goal that is genuinely worthwhile.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Taken together, if your team sees you as an expert, you'll find it much easier to motivate your people to perform at their best.</p>
			
			<p>So how do you build expert power?</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Gain expertise:</strong> The first step is fairly obvious (if time consuming) &#8211; gain expertise. And, if you are already using tools like the information gathering tool, the chances are that you have already progressed well ahead in this direction.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>But just being an expert isn't enough, it is also necessary that your people recognize your expertise and see you as a credible source of information and advice. Gary A. Yukl, in his book &#8216;Leadership in Organizations,&#8217; details some steps to build expert power. These are:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Promote an image of expertise:</strong> Since perceived expertise in many occupations is associated with a person's education and experience, a leader should (subtly) make sure that subordinates, peers, and superiors are aware of his or her formal education, relevant work experience, and significant accomplishments.</p>
						
						<p>One common way of doing this is to display diplomas, licenses, awards, and other evidence of expertise in a prominent location in your office &#8211; after all, if you&#39;ve worked hard to gain knowledge, it&#39;s fair that you get credit for it. Another tactic is to make subtle references to prior education or experience (for example, &#8216;When I was chief engineer at GE, we had a problem similar to this one&#8217;). Beware, however: this can easily be overdone.</p>
					</li>
					
					<li><strong>Maintain credibility:</strong> Once established, you should carefully protect your image of expertise. Avoid making careless comments about subjects on which you are poorly informed, and avoid being associated with projects with a low likelihood of success.</li><br>
					
					<li><strong>Act confidently and decisively in a crisis:</strong> In a crisis or emergency, subordinates prefer a &#8216;take charge&#8217; leader who appears to know how to direct the group in coping with the problem. In this kind of situation, your people will associate confident, firm leadership with expert knowledge. Even if you&#39;re not sure how to deal with a crisis, you&#39;ll lose influence with members of your team if you appear confused.</li><br>
					
					<li><strong>Keep informed:</strong> Expert power is exercised through rational persuasion and demonstration of expertise. Rational persuasion depends on a firm grasp of up&#45;to&#45;date facts. It is therefore essential that you keep well&#45;informed of developments within your team, within your organization, and in the outside world.</li><br>
					
					<li><strong>Recognize team member concerns:</strong> Use of rational persuasion should not be seen as a form of one-way communication from the leader to members of his or her team. Listen carefully to the concerns and uncertainties of your team members, and make sure that you address these.</li><br>
					
					<li><strong>Avoid threatening the self-esteem of subordinates:</strong> Expert power is based on a knowledge differential between the leader and team members. Unfortunately, the very existence of this differential can cause problems if you're not careful about the way in which you exercise expert power.</li><br>
					
				</ul>
			</p>
				
			<p>Team members can dislike unfavorable status comparisons where the gap is very large and obvious. And they are likely to be upset by a leader who acts in a superior way, and arrogantly flaunts his greater expertise.</p>
				
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">16</span></div>
				
			<p>In the process of arguing for what they want, some leaders lecture their team members in a condescending manner and convey the impression that the other team members are &#8216;ignorant.&#8217; Guard against this.</p>

			<h3>Leadership Styles</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Using the right one for your situation</div>
			
			<p>From Mahatma Gandhi to Winston Churchill to Martin Luther King to Rudolph Giuliani, there are as many leadership styles as there are leaders. Fortunately, businesspeople and psychologists have developed useful and simple ways to describe the main styles of leadership, and these can help aspiring leaders understand which styles they should use.</p>
			
			<p>So, whether you manage a team at work, captain a sports team, or lead a major corporation, which approach is best? Consciously, or subconsciously, you'll probably use some of the leadership styles in this article at some point. Understanding these styles and their impact can help you develop your own, personal leadership style &#8211; and help you become a more effective leader.</p>
			
			<p>With this in mind, there are many different frameworks that have shaped our current understanding of leadership, and many of these have their place, just as long as they're used appropriately. This article looks at some of the most common frameworks, and then looks at popular styles of leadership.</p>
			
			<h4>Leadership Theories</h4>
			
			<p>Researchers have developed a number of leadership theories over the years. These can be categorized into four main types:</p>
			<ol class="bold">
				<li>Trait theories <span>&#8211; What type of person makes a good leader?</li>
					<p>Trait theories argue that leaders share a number of common personality traits and characteristics, and that leadership emerges from these traits. Early trait theories promoted the idea that leadership is an innate, instinctive quality that you either have or don't have. Thankfully, we've moved on from this approach, and we're learning more about what we can do as individuals to develop leadership qualities within ourselves and others.</p>
						
					<p>What's more, traits are external behaviors that emerge from things going on within the leader&#39;s mind &#8211; and it&#39;s these internal beliefs and processes that are important for effective leadership.</p>
						
					<p>Trait theory does, however, help us identify some qualities that are helpful when leading others and, together, these emerge as a generalized leadership style. Examples include empathy, assertiveness, good decision-making, and likability. In our article Building Tomorrow&#39;s Leaders, we discuss a series of attributes that are important for all types of leaders to develop. However, none of these traits, nor any combination of them, will guarantee success as a leader. You need more than that.</p>
					
				<li>Behavioral theories <span>&#8211; What does a good leader do?</li>
						
					<p>Behavioral theories focus on how leaders behave. Do they dictate what needs to be done and expect cooperation? Or do they involve the team in decisions to encourage acceptance and support?</p>
						
					<p>In the 1930s, Kurt Lewin developed a leadership framework based on a leader's decision-making behavior. Lewin argued that there are three types of leaders:</p>

						<li>Autocratic leaders make decisions without consulting their teams. This is considered appropriate when decisions genuinely need to be taken quickly, when there&#39;s no need for input, and when team agreement isn&#39t necessary for a successful outcome.</li><br>
						<li>Democratic leaders allow the team to provide input before making a decision, although the degree of input can vary from leader to leader. This type of style is important when team agreement matters, but it can be quite difficult to manage when there are lots of different perspectives and ideas.</li><br>
						<li>Laissez&#45;faire leaders don&#39;t interfere; they allow the team to make many of the decisions. Typically this happens when the team is highly capable and motivated, and it doesn&#39;t need close monitoring or supervision.</li>
					</ol>
						
					<p>Similar to Lewin&#39;s model, the Blake&#45;Mouton Managerial Grid helps you decide how best to lead, depending on your concern for people versus your concern for production. The model describes five different leadership styles: impoverished, country club, team leader, produce or perish, or middle of the road. The descriptions of these will help you understand your own leadership habits and adapt them to meet your team's needs.</p>
						
					<p>John Adair's Action-Centered Leadership model is another framework that's consistent with behavioral theories of leadership. Using this model, the &#8220;best&#8221; leadership style is determined by balancing task, team, and individual responsibilities. Leaders who spend time managing each of these elements will likely be more successful than those who focus mostly on only one element.</p>
						
					<p>Clearly, then, how leaders behave impacts on their effectiveness. Researchers have realized, though, that many of these leadership behaviors are appropriate at different times. So, the best leaders are those who can use many different behavioral styles and use the right style for each situation.</p>
						
				<li>Contingency theories <span>&#8211; How does the situation influence good leadership?</li>
			
					<p>The realization that there isn&#39;t one correct type of leader led to theories that the best leadership style is contingent on, or depends on, the situation. These theories try to predict which leadership style is best in which circumstance.</p>
						
					<p>When a decision is needed fast, which style is preferred? When the leader needs the full support of the team, is there a better way to lead? Should a leader be more people oriented or task oriented? These are all examples of questions that contingency leadership theories try to address.</p>
					
					<p>A popular contingency-based framework is the Hersey-Blanchard Situational Leadership Theory, which links leadership style with the maturity of individual members of the leader&#39;s team.</p>
					
				<li>Power and influence theories <span>&#8211; What is the source of the leader's power?</li>
			
					<p>These theories of leadership take an entirely different approach. They&#39;re based on the different ways in which leaders use power and influence to get things done, and the leadership styles that emerge as a result. Perhaps the most well known of these theories is French and Raven&#39;s Five Forms of Power. This model distinguishes between using your position to exert power, and using your personal attributes to be powerful.</p>
						
					<p>French and Raven identified three types of positional power &#8211; legitimate, reward, and coercive &#8211; and two sources of personal power &#8211; expert and referent (your personal appeal and charm). The model suggests that using personal power is the better alternative and, because Expert Power (the power that comes with being a real expert in the job) is the most legitimate of these, that you should actively work on building this. Similarly, leading by example is another highly effective way to establish and sustain a positive influence with your team.</p>
						
				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">18</span></div>
					
					<p>Another valid leadership style that&#39;s supported by power and influence theories is Transactional Leadership. This approach assumes that work is done only because it is rewarded, and for no other reason, and it therefore focuses on designing tasks and reward structures. While it may not be the most appealing leadership strategy in terms of building relationships and developing a long-term motivating work environment, it does work, and it&#39;s used in most organizations on a daily basis to get things done.</p>
						
			</ol>
			
			<h4>An Up-to-Date Understanding of Leadership</h4>
			
			<p>Within all of these theories, frameworks, and approaches to leadership, there&#39;s an underlying message that leaders need to have a variety of factors working in their favor. Effective leadership is not simply based on a set of attributes, behaviors, or influences. You must have a wide range of abilities and approaches that you can draw upon.</p>
			
			<p>Having said this, however, there&#39;s one leadership style that is appropriate in very many corporate situations &#8211; that of <Transformational Leadership. A leader using this style:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Has integrity.</li>
				<li>Sets clear goals.</li>
				<li>Clearly communicates a vision.</li>
				<li>Sets a good example.</li>
				<li>Expects the best from the team.</li>
				<li>Encourages.</li>
				<li>Supports.</li>
				<li>Recognizes good work and people.</li>
				<li>Provides stimulating work.</li>
				<li>Helps people see beyond their self-interests and focus more on team interests and needs.</li>
				<li>Inspires.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>In short, transformational leaders are exceptionally motivating, and they&#39;re trusted. When your team trusts you, and is really &#8220;fired up&#8221; by the way you lead, you can achieve great things!</p>
			
			<div class="grey-background">
				<p>The transformational leadership style is the dominant leadership style taught in our How to Lead: Discover the Leader Within You program, although we do recommend that other styles are brought in as the situation demands.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>Having said that Transformational Leadership suits very many circumstances in business, we need to remember that there may be situations where it's not the best style. This is why it's worth knowing about the other styles shown below so that you have a greater chance of finding the right combination for the situation you find yourself in.</p>
			
			<h4>Popular Leadership Styles &#8211; A Glossary</h4>
			
			<p>The leadership theories and styles discussed so far are based on research. However, many more terms are used to describe approaches to leadership, even if these don't fit within a particular theoretical system. It&#39;s worth understanding these!</p>
			
			<ol class="bold">
				<li>Autocratic leadership</li>
					
					<p>Autocratic leadership is an extreme form of transactional leadership, where leaders have absolute power over their workers or team. Staff and team members have little opportunity to make suggestions, even if these would be in the team&#39;s or the organization&#39;s best interest.</p>
					
				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">19</span></div>
				
					<p>Most people tend to resent being treated like this. Therefore, autocratic leadership usually leads to high levels of absenteeism and staff turnover. For some routine and unskilled jobs, the style can remain effective because the advantages of control may outweigh the disadvantages.</p>
				
				<li>Bureaucratic leadership</li>
					
					<p>Bureaucratic leaders work &#8220;by the book.&#8221; They follow rules rigorously, and ensure that their staff follows procedures precisely. This is a very appropriate style for work involving serious safety risks (such as working with machinery, with toxic substances, or at dangerous heights) or where large sums of money are involved (such as handling cash).</p>
				
				<li>Charismatic leadership</li>
					
					<p>A charismatic leadership style can seem similar to transformational leadership, because these leaders inspire lots of enthusiasm in their teams and are very energetic in driving others forward. However, charismatic leaders can tend to believe more in themselves than in their teams, and this creates a risk that a project, or even an entire organization, might collapse if the leader leaves. In the eyes of the followers, success is directly connected to the presence of the charismatic leader. As such, charismatic leadership carries great responsibility, and it needs a long&#45;term commitment from the leader.</p>
					
				<li>Democratic leadership or participative leadership</li>
				
					<p>Although democratic leaders make the final decisions, they invite other members of the team to contribute to the decision&#45;making process. This not only increases job satisfaction by involving team members, but it also helps to develop people's skills. Team members feel in control of their own destiny, so they&#39;re motivated to work hard by more than just a financial reward.</p>
					
					<p>Because participation takes time, this approach can take more time, but often the end result is better. The approach can be most suitable when working as a team is essential, and when quality is more important than speed to market or productivity.</p>
					
				<li>Laissez&#45;faire leadership</li>
				
					<p>This French phrase means &#8220;leave it be,&#8221; and it&#39;s used to describe leaders who leave their team members to work on their own. It can be effective if the leader monitors what's being achieved and communicates this back to the team regularly. Most often, laissez&#45;faire leadership is effective when individual team members are very experienced and skilled self&#45;starters. Unfortunately, this type of leadership can also occur when managers don&#39;t apply sufficient control.</p>
					
				<li>People&#45;oriented leadership or relations&#45;oriented leadership</li>
				
					<p>This is the opposite of task&#45;oriented leadership. With people&#45;oriented leadership, leaders are totally focused on organizing, supporting, and developing the people in their teams. It&#39;s a participative style, and it tends to encourage good teamwork and creative collaboration.</p>
					
					<p>In practice, most leaders use both task&#45;oriented and people&#45;oriented styles of leadership.</p>
					
				<li>Servant leadership</li>
				
					<p>This term, created by Robert Greenleaf in the 1970s, describes a leader who is often not formally recognized as such. When someone, at any level within an organization, leads simply by meeting the needs of the team, he or she is described as a &#8220;servant leader.&#8221;</p>
					
					<p>In many ways, servant leadership is a form of democratic leadership, because the whole team tends to be involved in decision making.</p>
					
					<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">20</span></div>
					
					<p>Supporters of the servant leadership model suggest that it&#39;s an important way to move ahead in a world where values are increasingly important, and where servant leaders achieve power on the basis of their values and ideals. Others believe that in competitive leadership situations, people who practice servant leadership can find themselves left behind by leaders using other leadership styles.</p>
					
				<li>Task&#45;Oriented leadership</li>
				
					<p>Highly task&#45;oriented leaders focus only on getting the job done, and they can be quite autocratic. They actively define the work and the roles required, put structures in place, plan, organize, and monitor. However, because task&#45;oriented leaders don&#39;t tend to think much about the well&#45;being of their teams, this approach can suffer many of the flaws of autocratic leadership, with difficulties in motivating and retaining staff.</p>
					
				<li>Transactional leadership</li>
				
					<p>This style of leadership starts with the idea that team members agree to obey their leader totally when they accept a job. The &#8220;transaction&#8221; is usually the organization paying the team members in return for their effort and compliance. The leader has a right to &#8220;punish&#8221; team members if their work doesn&#39;t meet the pre&#45;determined standard.</p>
					
					<p>Team members can do little to improve their job satisfaction under transactional leadership. The leader could give team members some control of their income/reward by using incentives that encourage even higher standards or greater productivity. Alternatively, a transactional leader could practice &#8220;management by exception&#8221; &#8211; rather than rewarding better work, the leader could take corrective action if the required standards are not met.</p>
					
					<p>Transactional leadership is really a type of management, not a true leadership style, because the focus is on short&#45;term tasks. It has serious limitations for knowledge&#45;based or creative work.</p>
					
				<li>Transformational leadership</li>
				
					<p>As we discussed earlier, people with this leadership style are true leaders who inspire their teams constantly with a shared vision of the future. While this leader&#39;s enthusiasm is often passed onto the team, he or she can need to be supported by &#8220;detail people.&#8221; That&#39;s why, in many organizations, both transactional and transformational leadership are needed. The transactional leaders (or managers) ensure that routine work is done reliably, while the transformational leaders look after initiatives that add value.</p>
			</ol>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>While the transformational leadership approach is often highly effective, there&#39;s no one &#8220;right&#8221; way to lead or manage that fits all situations. To choose the most effective approach for yourself, consider the following:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The skill levels and experience of your team.</li>
				<li>The work involved (routine, or new and creative).</li>
				<li>The organizational environment (stable or radically changing, conservative or
adventurous).</li>
				<li>You own preferred or natural style.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Good leaders often switch instinctively between styles, according to the people they lead and the work that needs to be done. Establish trust &#8211; that's key to this process &#8211; and remember to balance the needs of the organization against the needs of your team.</p>

			<h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Developing strong &#8216;people skills&#8217;</div>
			
			<p>We probably all know people, either at work or in our personal lives, who are really good listeners. No matter what kind of situation we&#39;re in, they always seem to know just what to say &#8211; and how to say it &#8211; so that we&#39;re not offended or upset. They&#39;re caring and considerate, and even if we don&#39;t find a solution to our problem, we usually leave feeling more hopeful and optimistic.</p>
			
			<p>We probably also know people who are masters at managing their emotions. They don&#39;t get angry in stressful situations. Instead, they have the ability to look at a problem and calmly find a solution. They&#39;re excellent decision makers, and they know when to trust their intuition. Regardless of their strengths, however, they&#39;re usually willing to look at themselves honestly. They take criticism well, and they know when to use it to improve their performance.</p>
			
			<p>People like this have a high degree of emotional intelligence, or EI. They know themselves very well, and they're also able to sense the emotional needs of others.</p>
			
			<p>Would you like to be more like this?</p>
			
			<p>As more and more people accept that emotional intelligence is just as important to professional success as technical ability, organizations are increasingly using EI when they hire and promote.</p>
			
			<p>For example, one large cosmetics company recently revised their hiring process for salespeople to choose candidates based on emotional intelligence. The result? Salespeople hired with the new system have sold, on average, $91,000 more than salespeople selected under the old system. There has also been significantly lower staff turnover among the group chosen for their emotional intelligence.</p>
			
			<p>So, what exactly is emotional intelligence, and what can you do to improve yours?</p>
			
			<h4>What Is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
			
			<p>We all have different personalities, different wants and needs, and different ways of showing our emotions. Navigating through this all takes tact and cleverness &#8211; especially if we hope to succeed in life. This is where emotional intelligence becomes important.</p>
			
			<p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize your emotions, understand what they&#39;re telling you, and realize how your emotions affect people around you. Emotional intelligence also involves your perception of others: when you understand how they feel, this allows you to manage relationships more effectively.</p>
			
			<p>People with high emotional intelligence are usually successful in most things they do. Why? Because they&#39;re the ones that others want on their team. When people with high EI send an email, it gets answered. When they need help, they get it. Because they make others feel good, they go through life much more easily than people who are easily angered or upset.</p>
			
			<h4>Characteristics of Emotional Intelligence</h4>
			
			<p>Daniel Goleman, an American psychologist, developed a framework of five elements that define emotional intelligence:</p>
			
			<ol class="indent-outside">
				<li><strong>Self-Awareness: </strong><span>People with high emotional intelligence are usually very self&#45;aware. They understand their emotions, and because of this, they don&#39;t let their feelings rule them. They&#39;re confident &#8221; because they trust their intuition and don&#39;t let their emotions get out of control.</li>
			</ol>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">22</span></div>
			
			<ol class="indent-outside">
				<li class="invisibleNumber"> <p>They&#39;re also willing to take an honest look at themselves. They know their strengths and weaknesses, and they work on these areas so they can perform better. Many people believe that this self&#45;awareness is the most important part of emotional intelligence.</p></li><br>
					
				<li><strong>Self-Regulation: </strong><span>This is the ability to control emotions and impulses. People who self&#45;regulate typically don&#39;t allow themselves to become too angry or jealous, and they don&#39;t make impulsive, careless decisions. They think before they act. Characteristics of self&#45; regulation are thoughtfulness, comfort with change, integrity, and the ability to say no.</li><br>
				
				<li><strong>Motivation: </strong><span>People with a high degree of emotional intelligence are usually motivated. They&#39;re willing to defer immediate results for long&#45;term success. They&#39;re highly productive, love a challenge, and are very effective in whatever they do.</li><br>
				
				<li><strong>Empathy: </strong><span>This is perhaps the second&#45;most important element of emotional intelligence. Empathy is the ability to identify with and understand the wants, needs, and viewpoints of those around you. People with empathy are good at recognizing the feelings of others, even when those feelings may not be obvious. As a result, empathetic people are usually excellent at managing relationships, listening, and relating to others. They avoid stereotyping and judging too quickly, and they live their lives in a very open, honest way.</li><br>
				
				<li><strong>Social Skills: </strong><span>It&#39;s usually easy to talk to and like people with good social skills, another sign of high emotional intelligence. Those with strong social skills are typically team players. Rather than focus on their own success first, they help others develop and shine. They can manage disputes, are excellent communicators, and are masters at building and maintaining relationships.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>As you&#39;ve probably determined, emotional intelligence can be a key to success in your life &#8211; especially in your career. The ability to manage people and relationships is very important in all leaders, so developing and using your emotional intelligence can be a good way to show others the leader inside of you.</p>
			
			<h4>How to Improve Your Emotional Intelligence</h4>
			
			<p>The good news is that emotional intelligence CAN be taught and developed. Many books and tests are available to help you determine your current EI, and identify where you may need to do some work. You can also use these tips:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Observe how you react to people. Do you rush to judgment before you know all of the facts? Do you stereotype? Look honestly at how you think and interact with other people. Try to put yourself in their place, and be more open and accepting of their perspectives and needs.</li><br>
				
				<li>Look at your work environment. Do you seek attention for your accomplishments? Humility can be a wonderful quality, and it doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re shy or lack self&#45;confidence. When you practice humility, you say that you know what you did, and you can be quietly confident about it. Give others a chance to shine &#8211; put the focus on them, and don&#39;t worry too much about getting praise for yourself.</li><br>
				
				<li>Do a self&#45;evaluation. What are your weaknesses? Are you willing to accept that you&#39;re not perfect and that you could work on some areas to make yourself a better person? Have the courage to look at yourself honestly &#8211; it can change your life.</li><br>
				
				<li>Examine how you react to stressful situations. Do you become upset every time there&#39;s a delay or something doesn&#39;t happen the way you want? Do you blame others or become angry at them, even when it&#39;s not their fault? The ability to stay calm and in control in difficult situations is highly valued &#8211; in the business world and outside it. Keep your emotions under control when things go wrong.</li>
				
				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">23</span></div>
				
				<li>Take responsibility for your actions. If you hurt someone&#39;s feelings, apologize directly – don&#39;t ignore what you did or avoid the person. People are usually more willing to forgive and forget if you make an honest attempt to make things right.</li><br>
				
				<li>Examine how your actions will affect others &#8211; before you take those actions. If your decision will impact others, put yourself in their place. How will they feel if you do this? Would you want that experience? If you must take the action, how can you help others deal with the effects?</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>Although &#8216;regular&#8217; intelligence is important to success in life, emotional intelligence is key to relating well to others and achieving your goals. Many people believe that emotional intelligence is at least as important as regular intelligence, and many companies now use EI testing to hire new staff.</p>
			
			<p>Emotional intelligence is an awareness of your actions and feelings &#8211; and how they affect those around you. It also means that you value others, listen to their wants and needs, and are able to empathize or identify with them on many different levels.</p>

			<h3>Team Effectiveness Assessment</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">How well do you and your team work together?</div>
			
			<p>Teamwork has a dramatic affect on organizational performance. An effective team can help an organization achieve incredible results. A team that is not working can cause unnecessary disruption, failed delivery and strategic failure.</p>
				
			<p>Nowadays it is almost impossible to avoid being a member of team. If you&#39;re not on an official team at work, chances are you function within one in one way or another. So it&#39;s important for your personal and career development to know your teamworking strengths and weaknesses.</p>

			<p><strong>Team Development</strong> (Statements 1, 11)</p>
			
			<p>Your score out of 10 for these statements: __________</p>
			
			<p>Teams do not become effective overnight. Team building is a process that requires due attention and care. If you try to skip over important development stages, you risk not forming the solid foundation needed when trouble or setbacks occur.</p>
			
			<p>To build, lead, or participate in a team requires an understanding of the stages of team development. Through extensive research, it has been found that successful teams have certain aspects of their development paths in common. The one that most people are aware of is Tuckman&#39;s Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing model.</p>
			
			<p>Two other factors that significantly increase a team&#39;s chances of being effective are having a well thought out team orientation process, and developing a clear team charter. Both of these help you establish clear guidelines and set clear expectations. When the individuals on a team all know what they are supposed to be doing and how they are to go about doing it, you give the team a good start on maximizing performance. To read more about these processes see the Mind Tools articles on Successful Induction and Team Charters.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Feedback</strong> (Statements 2, 13)</p>
			
			<p>Your score out of 10 for these statements: __________</p>
			
			<p>One of the best ways of improving people&#39;s performance is by providing information to team members about their individual performance, as well as the overall team performance. After all, how do you know what is working and what isn&#39;t if no one gives you an objective summary?</p>
			
			<p>There are usually plenty of people around who are ready and willing to give you their opinions on this. Unfortunately, this information is often conveyed in a manner that causes resentment and animosity.</p>
			
			<p>For feedback to be positive and growth&#45;inspiring, it has to be delivered properly, with enough attention being paid to how the receiver is going to perceive and process it.

			<p><strong>Participation and Articulating Vision</strong> (Statements 3, 9, 10)</p>
			
			<p>Your score out of 15 for these statements: __________</p>
			
			<p>Articulating the team&#39;s vision is fundamental to developing a high performing team. It's the vision that motivates and directs a team to reach its goal.</p>
			
			<p>The best teams invest a great deal of time and energy into exploring and understanding the overall purpose and vision of the team. From this vision, a set of goals and objectives emerges that helps the team stay focused and on track.</p>
			
			<p>The key to using vision successfully is making the process of discovering it a participative one. You can tell a team what the vision is and team members may or may not agree that the cause is worth working hard for. If, however, you allow the team to explore the vision, to see how their specific roles fit into the big picture, and provide meaningful opportunities for team members to assist in the team's success, then you have the basis for a high performing team.</p>
			
			<p>To learn more about tying vision to goals see Performance Management and KPIs, The Balanced Scorecard, and Management By Objectives. To learn where you sit on the participative management scale, see the article on The Blake&#45;Mouton Managerial Grid. The articles on Avoiding Micromanagement and Successful Delegation discuss why it is important to provide challenges to your team members and allow them to use their skills and abilities to the fullest.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Managing Conflict</strong> (Statements 2, 12, 14)</p>
			
			<p>Your score out of 15 for these statements: __________</p>
			
			<p>Conflict can be an inevitable consequence of working with other people. Opinions, values, styles, and a whole host of other differences provide more than enough grounds for disagreement. This disagreement is actually part of the reason why teams can be so effective &#8211; the more perspectives that go into a process, the better the end result. usually!</p>
			
			<p>Allowing the differences to get out of hand, though, causes unnecessary disruption and leads to breakdowns in working relationships. Team members and leaders should take it upon themselves to understand the basics of conflict management and also learn more about different styles and ways of thinking and working.</p>

			<p><strong>Group Roles and Structure</strong> (Statements 6, 8, 14, 15)</p>
			
			<p>Your score out of 20 for these statements: __________</p>
			
			<p>The differences between how people work and view the world make for interesting conversations and dynamic teams. An effective team capitalizes on these natural differences and maximizes performance by putting the right people in the right roles.</p>
			
			<p>The articles on RACI and Task Allocation discuss this exact issue and provide practical methods for getting the most out of your team.</p>
			
			<p>Some research has also been done on the different types of roles people play within teams. While the jury is still out on the detail of this research, having insight into the types of roles that are taken on in teams can help you see which roles and behaviors are constructive and which ones aren&#39;t. Mind Tools has featured two such models of team roles: Belbin&#39;s Team Roles and Benne and Sheats&#39; Team Roles.</p>

			<p><strong>Team Member Development</strong> (Statements 7, 12)</p>
			
			<p>Your score out of 10 for these statements: __________</p>
			
			<p>No matter what role a person plays in a team, or what tasks he or she has been assigned to, there is almost always room for personal improvement. When the individuals on a team are functioning at high capacity, the team can flourish as well.</p>
			
			<p>This is a critical understanding in team performance. Although there is no &#8216;I&#8217; in &#8216;Team&#8217; you have to remember there is no team without individuals. You have to build and foster the skills in the individuals that are congruent with the needs of the team.</p>
			
			<p>To do this, requires a solid understanding of training methods and ways of identifying the needs of the team members. The article on Successful Induction talks about setting out a training needs analysis from day one. The articles on Understanding Developmental Needs and Training Needs Assessment provide practical tips for identifying areas that need improvement.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Understanding and Collaboration</strong> (Statements 5, 14)</p>
			
			<p>Your score out of 10 for these statements: __________</p>
			
			<p>The last area of team functioning explored by this quiz covers how well you and your team are able to collaborate and understand the key issues facing the team. Again, this goes back to the idea of cohesion. Members of successful teams all head in the same direction, and work for the same purpose.</p>
			
			<p>When priorities and goals diverge, tensions appear within the team, and the whole is often no longer greater than the sum of its parts. This is a fundamental issue for high performing teams. Consensus, consistency and agreement are vital for effective teamwork.</p>
			
			<p>Even if your test score didn&#39;t point to this aspect of teamwork, the articles on Concept Attainment and the Delphi Technique are highly recommended.</p>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>An effective team is much more than a bunch of people thrown together to accomplish a goal. Because teams are such an inherent part of how we work, it is easy to believe we know what makes a team perform well, however this is often not the case.</p>
			
			<p>Using this test, you can uncover areas of improvement that will help you become a better overall team member and team builder.</p>

			<h3>Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Helping new teams perform effectively, quickly</div>
			
			<p>Effective teamwork is essential in today&#39;s world, but as you&#39;ll know from the teams you have led or belonged to, you can&#39;t expect a new team to perform exceptionally from the very outset. Team formation takes time, and usually follows some easily recognizable stages, as the team journeys from being a group of strangers to becoming united team with a common goal.</p>
			
			<p>Whether your team is a temporary working group or a newly&#45;formed, permanent team, by understanding these stages you will be able to help the team quickly become productive.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">28</span></div>
			
			<h4>Understanding the Theory</h4>
			
			<p>Psychologist Bruce Tuckman first came up with the memorable words &#8216;forming, storming, norming and performing&#8217; back in 1965 to describe the path to high-performance that most teams follow. Later, he added a fifth stage that he called &#8216;adjourning&#8217; (and others often call &#8216;mourning&#8217; &#8211; it rhymes better!)</p>
			
			<p>Teams initially go through a &#8216;<strong>Forming</strong>&#8217; stage in which members are positive and polite. Some members are anxious, as they haven&#39;t yet worked out exactly what work the team will involve. Others are simply excited about the task ahead. As leader, you play a dominant role at this stage: other members&#39; roles and responsibilities are less clear.</p>
			
			<p>This stage is usually fairly short, and may only last for a single meeting at which people are introduced to one&#45;another. At this stage there may be discussions about how the team will work, which can be frustrating for some members who simply want to get on with the team task.</p>
			
			<p>Soon, reality sets in and your team moves into a &#8216;<strong>Storming</strong>&#8217; phase. Your authority may be challenged as others jockey for position as their roles are clarified. The ways of working start to be defined, and as leader you must be aware that some members may feel overwhelmed by how much there is to do, or uncomfortable with the approach being used. Some react by questioning how worthwhile the goal of the team is and resist taking on tasks. This is the stage when many teams fail, and even those who stick with it feel that they are on an emotional roller coaster as they try to focus on the job in hand without the support of established processes or relationships with their colleagues.</p>
			
			<p>Gradually, the team moves into a &#8216;<strong>Norming</strong>&#8217; stage, as a hierarchy is established. Team members come to respect your authority as leader, and others show leadership in specific areas.</p>
			
			<p>Now the team members know each other better, they may be socializing together, and they are able to ask each other for help and provide constructive criticism. The team is developing a strong commitment to the team goal, and you start to see good progress towards it.</p>
			
			<p>There is often a prolonged overlap between storming and norming behavior: As new tasks come up, the team may lapse back into typical storming stage behavior, but this eventually dies out.</p>
			
			<p>When the team reaches the &#8216;<strong>Performing</strong>&#8217; stage, hard work leads directly to progress towards the shared vision of their goal, supported by the structures and processes which have been set up. Individual team members may join or leave the team without affecting the performing culture.</p>
			
			<p>As leader, you are able to delegate much of the work and can concentrate on developing team members. Being part of the team at this stage feels &#8216;easy&#8217; compared with earlier on.</p>
			
			<p>Project teams exist only for a fixed period, and even permanent teams may be disbanded through organizational restructuring. As team leader, your concern is both for the team&#39;s goal and the team members. Breaking up a team can be stressful for all concerned and the &#8216;<strong>Adjourning</strong>&#8217; or &#8216;<strong>Mourning</strong>&#8217; stage is important in reaching both team goal and personal conclusions.</p>
			
			<p>The break up of the team can be particularly hard for members who like routine or have developed close working relationships with other team members, particularly if their future roles or even jobs look uncertain.</p>
			
			<h4>Using the Tool</h4>
			
			<p>As a team leader, your aim is to help your team reach and sustain high performance as soon as possible. To do this, you will need to change your approach at each stage. The steps below will help ensure you are doing the right thing at the right time.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">29</span></div>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Identify which stage of the team development your team is at from the descriptions above.</li><br>
				<li>Now consider what needs to be done to move towards the Performing stage, and what you can do to help the team do that effectively. The table below (Figure 1) helps you understand your role at each stage and how to move the team forward.</li><br>

			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">30</span></div>
			
			<div class="grey-background">
				<p><strong>Tip 1:</strong><br>
				Make sure that you leave plenty of time in your schedule to coach team members through the &#8216;Forming&#8217;, &#8216;Storming&#8217; and &#8216;Norming&#8217; stages.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Tip 2:</strong><br>
				Think about how much progress you should expect towards the goal and by when, and measure success against that. Remember that you&#39;ve got to go through the &#8216;Forming&#8217;, &#8216;Storming&#8217; and &#8216;Norming&#8217; stages before the team starts &#8216;Performing&#8217;, and that there may not be much progress during this time. Communicating progress against appropriate targets is important if your team&#39;s members are to feel that what they&#39;re going through is worth while. Without such targets, they can feel that, &#8216;Three weeks have gone by and we&#39;ve still not got anywhere&#8217;.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Tip 3:</strong><br>
				Not all teams and situations will behave in this way, however many will &#8211; use this approach, but don&#39;t try to force situations to fit it. And make sure that people don&#39;t use knowledge of the &#8216;storming&#8217; stage as a license for boorish behavior.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>Another useful model of team formation is Cog&#39;s Ladder. The phases of each model largely correspond with each other, although Cog&#39;s Ladder includes an additional &#8216;Why are we here?&#8217; phase which falls across Tuckman&#39;s Forming and Storming phases.</p>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>Teams are formed because they can achieve far more than their individual members can on their own, and while being part of a high&#45;performing team can be fun, it can take patience and professionalism to get to that stage.</p>
			
			<p>Effective team leaders can accelerate that process and reduce the difficulties that team members experience by understanding what they need to do as their team moves through the stages from forming to storming, norming and, finally, performing.</p>

		<section class="subsection" data-number="9" data-name="Belbin's Team Roles">
			<h3>Belbin's Team Roles</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">How understanding team roles can improve team performance</div>
			
			<p>When a team is performing at its best, you&#39;ll usually find that each team member has clear responsibilities. Just as importantly, you&#39;ll normally see that every role needed to achieve the team&#39;s goal is being performed fully and well.</p>
			
			<p>But often, despite clear roles and responsibilities, a team will fall short of its full potential.</p>
			
			<p>How often does this happen in the teams you work with? Perhaps some team members don&#39;t complete what you expect them to do. Perhaps some team members are not quite flexible enough, so things &#8216;fall between the cracks&#8217;. Maybe someone who is valued for their expert input fails to see the wider picture, and so misses out tasks or steps that others would expect. Or perhaps one team member become frustrated because he or she disagrees with the approach of another team members.</p>
			
			<p>Dr Meredith Belbin studied team&#45;work for many years, and he famously observed that people in teams tend to assume different &#8216;team roles&#8217;. He defines a &#8216;team role&#8217; as &#8216;a tendency to behave, contribute and interrelate with others in a particular way&#8217; and named nine such team roles that underlie team success.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">31</span></div>
			
			<h4>Creating More Balanced Teams</h4>
			
			<p>Belbin suggests that, by understanding your team role within a particular team, you can develop your strengths and manage your weaknesses as a team member, and so improve how you contribute to the team.</p>
			
			<p>Team leaders and team development practitioners often use the Belbin model to help create more balanced teams. Teams can become unbalanced if all team members have similar styles of behavior or team roles.</p>
			
			<p>If team members have similar weakness, the team as a whole may tend to have that weakness. If team members have similar team-work strengths, they may tend to compete (rather than co- operate) for the team tasks and responsibilities that best suit their natural styles. So you can use the model with your team to help ensure that necessary team roles are covered, and that potential behavioral tensions or weaknesses among the team member are addressed.</p>
			
			<div class="grey-background">
				<p><strong>Tip:</strong><br>
				Belbin's &#8216;team&#45;roles&#8217; are based on observed behavior and interpersonal styles.</p>
				
				<p>Whilst Belbin suggests that people tend to adopt a particular team&#45;role, bear in mind that your behavior and interpersonal style within a team is to some extent dependent on the situation: It relates not only to your own natural working style, but also to your interrelationships with others, and the work being done.</p>
				
				<p>Be careful: You, and the people you work with, may behave and interact quite differently in different teams or when the membership or work of the team changes.</p>
				
				<p>Also, be aware that there are other approaches in use, some of which complement this model, some of which conflict with it. By all means use this approach as a guide, however do not put too much reliance on it, and temper any conclusions with common sense.</p>
			</div><br>
			
			<h4>Understanding Belbin&#39;s Team Roles Model</h4>
			
			<p>Belbin identified nine team roles and he categorized those roles into three groups: Action Oriented, People Oriented, and Thought Oriented. Each team role is associated with typical behavioral and interpersonal strengths.</p>
			
			<p>Belbin also defined characteristic weaknesses that tend to accompany the team&#45;role. He called the characteristic weaknesses of team&#45;roles the &#8216;allowable&#8217; weaknesses; as for any behavioral weakness, these are areas to be aware of and potentially improve.</p>
			
			<p>The nine team&#45;roles are:</p>
			
			<div class="grey-header">Action Oriented Roles:</div>
			
			<h5><em>Shaper (SH)</em></h5>
			
			<p>Shapers are people who challenge the team to improve. They are dynamic and usually extroverted people who enjoy stimulating others, questioning norms, and finding the best approaches to problems. The Shaper is the one who shakes things up to make sure that all possibilities are considered and that the team does not become complacent.</p>
			
			<p>Shapers often see obstacles as exciting challenges and they tend to have the courage to push on when others feel like quitting.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">32</span></div>
			
			<p>Their potential weaknesses may be that they&#39;re argumentative, and that they may offend people&#39;s feelings.</p>
			
			<h5><em>Implementer (IMP)</em></h5>
			
			<p>Implementers are the people who get things done. They turn the team&#39;s ideas and concepts into practical actions and plans. They are typically conservative, disciplined people who work systematically and efficiently and are very well organized. These are the people who you can count on to get the job done.</p>
			
			<p>On the downside, Implementers may be inflexible and somewhat resistant to change.</p>
			
			<h5><em>Completer&#45;Finisher (CF)</em></h5>
			
			<p>Completer&#45;Finishers are the people who see that projects are completed thoroughly. They ensure there have been no errors or omissions and they pay attention to the smallest of details. They are very concerned with deadlines and will push the team to make sure the job is completed on time. They are described as perfectionists who are orderly, conscientious, and anxious.</p>
			
			<p>However, a Completer&#45;Finisher may worry unnecessarily and find it hard to delegate.</p>
			<br>
			
			<div class="grey-header">People Oriented Roles:</div>
			
			<h5><em>Coordinator (CO)</em></h5>
			
			<p>Coordinators are the ones who take on the traditional team-leader role and have also been referred to as the chairmen. They guide the team to what they perceive are the objectives. They are often excellent listeners and they are naturally able to recognize the value that each team members brings to the table. They are calm and good-natured and delegate tasks very effectively.</p>
			
			<p>Their potential weaknesses are that they may delegate away too much personal responsibility, and may tend to be manipulative.</p>
			
			<h5><em>Team Worker (TW)</em></h5>
			
			<p>Team Workers are the people who provide support and make sure the team is working together. These people fill the role of negotiators within the team and they are flexible, diplomatic, and perceptive. These tend to be popular people who are very capable in their own right but who prioritize team cohesion and helping people getting along.</p>
			
			<p>Their weaknesses may be a tendency to be indecisive, and maintain uncommitted positions during discussions and decision-making.</p>
			
			<h5><em>Resource Investigator (RI)</em></h5>
			
			<p>Resource Investigators are innovative and curious. They explore available options, develop contacts, and negotiate for resources on behalf of the team. They are enthusiastic team members, who identify and work with external stakeholders to help the team accomplish its objective. They are outgoing and are often extroverted, meaning that others are often receptive to them and their ideas.</p>
			
			<p>On the downside, they may lose enthusiasm quickly, and are often overly optimistic.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">33</span></div>
			
			<div class="grey-header">Thought Oriented Roles:</div>
			
			<h5><em>Plant (PL)</em></h5>
			
			<p>The Plant is the creative innovator who comes up with new ideas and approaches. They thrive on praise but criticism is especially hard for them to deal with. Plants are often introverted and prefer to work apart from the team. Because their ideas are so novel, they can be impractical at times. They may also be poor communicators and can tend to ignore given parameters and constraints.</p>
			
			<h5><em>Monitor&#45;Evaluator (ME)</em></h5>
			
			<p>Monitor&#45;Evaluators are best at analyzing and evaluating ideas that other people (often Plants) come up with. These people are shrewd and objective and they carefully weigh the pros and cons of all the options before coming to a decision.</p>
			
			<p>Monitor&#45;Evaluators are critical thinkers and very strategic in their approach. They are often perceived as detached or unemotional. Sometimes they are poor motivators who react to events rather than instigating them</p>
			
			<h5><em>Specialist (SP)</em></h5>
			
			<p>Specialists are people who have specialized knowledge that is needed to get the job done. They pride themselves on their skills and abilities, and they work to maintain their professional status. Their job within the team is to be an expert in the area, and they commit themselves fully to their field of expertise. This may limit their contribution, and lead to a preoccupation with technicalities at the expense of the bigger picture.</p>

			<h4>How to Use the Tool</h4>
			
			<p>The Belbin Team Roles Model can be used in several ways: You can use it to think about team balance before a project starts, you can use it to highlight and so manage interpersonal differences within an existing team, and you can use it to develop yourself as a team player.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">34</span></div>
			
			<p>The tool below helps you analyze team membership, using the Belbin team roles as checks for potential strengths and weakness.</p>
			
			<p>Use Belbin's model to analyze your team, and as a guide as you develop your team's strengths, and manage its weaknesses:</p>
			
			<ol class="indent-outside">
				<li>Over a period of time, observe the individual members of your team, and see how they behave, contribute and behave within the team.</li><br>
				<li>Now list the members of the team, and for each person write down the key strengths and characteristics you have observed. (You may also want to note down any observed weaknesses).</li><br>
				<li>Compare each person&#39;s listed strengths and weakness with the Belbin&#39;s descriptions of team&#45;roles, and note the one that most accurately describes that person.</li><br>
				<li>Once you have done this for each team member, consider the following questions:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Which team roles are missing from your team? And from this, ask yourself which strengths are likely to be missing from the team overall?</li>
					<li>Is there are prevalent team role that many of the team members share?</li>
				</ul>
			</ol>
				
			<div class="grey-background">
				<p><strong>Tip: Prevalent team roles:</strong><br>
				Among teams of people that do the same job, a few team roles often prevail. For example, within a research department, the team roles of Specialist and Plant may prevail. A team of business consultants may mainly comprise Team Workers and Shapers. Such teams may be unbalanced, in that they may be missing key approaches and outlooks.</p>
					
				<p>If the team is unbalanced, first identify any team weakness that is not naturally covered by any of the team members. Then identify any potential areas of conflict. For example, too many Shapers can weaken a team if each Shaper wants to pull the team in a different direction.</p>
			</div>
			
			<ol class="indent-outside" start="5">
				<li>Once you have identified potential weakness, areas of conflict and missing strengths, consider the options you have to improve and change this.</li><br>
				<li>Consider:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Whether an existing team member could compensate by purposefully adopting different a team role. With awareness and intention, this is sometimes possible.</li>
						<li>Whether one or more team members could improve how they work together and with others to avoid potential conflict of their natural styles.</li>
						<li>Whether new skills need to brought onto the team to cover weaknesses.</li>
					</ul>
			</ol>

				<p><strong>Tip:</strong><br>
				Remember not to depend too heavily on this idea when structuring your team &#8211; this is only one of many, many factors that are important in getting a team to perform at its best.</p>
				
				<p>That said, just knowing about the Belbin Team Roles model can bring more harmony to your team, as team members learn that there are different approaches that are important in different circumstances and that no one approach is best all of the time.</p>

And, because the number of people you can help is limited, your success is limited.</p>
			
			<p>However, if you&#39;re good at your job, people will want much more than this from you.</p>
			
			<p>This can lead to a real sense of pressure and work overload: You can&#39;t do everything that everyone wants, and this can leave you stressed, unhappy, and feeling that you&#39;re letting people down.</p>
			
			<p>On the positive side, however, you&#39;re being given a tremendous opportunity if you can find a way around this limitation. If you can realize this opportunity, you can be genuinely successful!</p>
			
			<p>One of the most common ways of overcoming this limitation is to learn how to delegate your work to other people. If you do this well, you can quickly build a strong and successful team of people, well able to meet the demands that others place.</p>
			
			<p>This is why delegation is such an important skill, and is one that you absolutely have to learn!</p>
			
			<h4>Why People Don&#39;t Delegate</h4>
			
			<p>To figure out how to delegate properly, it&#39;s important to understand why people avoid it. Quite simply, people don&#39;t delegate because it takes a lot of up&#45;front effort.</p>
			
			<p>After all, which is easier: designing and writing content for a brochure that promotes a new service you helped spearhead, or having other members of your team do it?</p>
			
			<p>You know the content inside and out. You can spew benefit statements in your sleep. It would be relatively straightforward for you to sit down and write it. It would even be fun! The question is, &#8216;Would it be a good use of your time?&#8217;</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">36</span></div>
			
			<p>While on the surface it&#39;s easier to do it yourself than explain the strategy behind the brochure to someone else, there are two key reasons that mean that it&#39;s probably better to delegate the task to someone else:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>First, if you have the ability to spearhead a new campaign, the chances are that your skills are better used further developing the strategy, and perhaps coming up with other new ideas. By doing the work yourself, you&#39;re failing to make best use of your time.</li>
				<li>Second, by meaningfully involving other people in the project, you develop those people&#39;s skills and abilities. This means that next time a similar project comes along, you can delegate the task with a high degree of confidence that it will be done well, with much less involvement from you.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Delegation allows you to make the best use of your time and skills, and it helps other people in the team grow and develop to reach their full potential in the organization.</p>
			
			<h4>When to Delegate</h4>
			
			<p>Delegation is a win&#45;win when done appropriately, however that does not mean that you can delegate just anything. To determine when delegation is most appropriate there are five key questions you need to ask yourself:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Is there someone else who has (or can be given) the necessary information or expertise to complete the task? Essentially is this a task that someone else can do, or is it critical that you do it yourself?</li><br>
				<li>Does the task provide an opportunity to grow and develop another person&#39;s skills?</li><br>
				<li>Is this a task that will recur, in a similar form, in the future?</li><br>
				<li>Do you have enough time to delegate the job effectively? Time must be available for adequate training, for questions and answers, for opportunities to check progress, and for rework if that is necessary.</li><br>
				<li>Is this a task that I should delegate? Tasks critical for long&#45;term success (for example, recruiting the right people for your team) genuinely do need your attention.</li><br>
			</ul>
			
			<p>If you can answer &#8216;yes&#8217; to at least some of the above questions, then it could well be worth delegating this job.</p>
			
			<div class="grey-background">
				<p>Other factors that contribute to the delegability of a task include:</p>
				
				<ol class="indent-outside">
					<li>The project&#39;s timelines/deadlines.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>How much time is there available to do the job?</li>
						<li>Is there time to redo the job if it&#39;s not done properly the first time?</li>
						<li>What are the consequences of not completing the job on time?</li>
					</ul>
					
					<li>Your expectations or goals for the project or task(s), including:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>How important is it that the results are of the highest possible quality?</li>
						<li>Is an &#8216;adequate&#8217; result good enough?</li>
						<li>Would a failure be crucial?</li>
						<li>How much would failure impact other things?</li>
					</ul>
				</ol>
			</div>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">37</span></div>
			
			<p>That being said, having all these conditions present is no guarantee that the delegated task will be completed successfully either. You also need to consider to whom you will delegate the task and how you will do it.</p>
			
			<h4>The Who and How of Delegating</h4>
			
			<p>Having decided to delegate a task there are some other factors to consider as well. As you think these through you can use our free Delegation Worksheet to keep record of the tasks you choose to delegate and who you want to delegate them to.</h4>
			
			<h5>To Whom Should You Delegate?</h5>
			
			<p>The factors to consider here include:</li>
			
			<ol class="indent-outside">
				<li>The experience, knowledge and skills of the individual as they apply to the delegated task.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>What knowledge, skills and attitude does the person already have?</li>
					<li>Do you have time and resources to provide any training needed?</li>
				</ul><br>
				
				<li>The individual&#39;s preferred work style.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>How independent is the person?</li>
					<li>What does he or she want from his or her job?</li>
					<li>What are his or her long&#45;term goals and interest, and how do these align with the work proposed?</li>
				</ul><br>
				
				<li>The current workload of this person.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Does the person have time to take on more work?</li>
					<li>Will you delegating this task require reshuffling of other responsibilities and workloads?</li>
				</ul>
			</ol>
			
			<div class="grey-background">
				<p>When you first start to delegate to someone, you may notice that he or she takes longer than you do to complete tasks. This is because you are an expert in the field and the person you have delegated to is still learning. Be patient: if you have chosen the right person to delegate to, and you are delegating correctly, you will find that he or she quickly becomes competent and reliable.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h5>How Should You Delegate?</h5>
			
			<p>Use the following principles to delegate successfully:</p>
			
			<ol class="indent-outside">
				<li>Clearly articulate the desired outcome. Begin with the end in mind and specify the desired results.</li><br>
				
				<li>Clearly identify constraints and boundaries. Where are the lines of authority, responsibility and accountability? Should the person:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Wait to be told what to do?</li>
					<li>Ask what to do?</li>
					<li>Recommend what should be done, and then act?</li>
					<li>Act, and then report results immediately?</li>
					<li>Initiate action, and then report periodically?</li>
				</ul><br>
				
				<li>Where possible, include people in the delegation process. Empower them to decide what tasks are to be delegated to them and when.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">38</span></div>
			
			<ol class="indent-outside" start="4">
				<li>Match the amount of responsibility with the amount of authority. Understand that you can delegate some responsibility, however you can&#39;t delegate away ultimate accountability. The buck stops with you!</li><br>
				
				<li>Delegate to the lowest possible organizational level. The people who are closest to the work are best suited for the task, because they have the most intimate knowledge of the detail of everyday work. This also increases workplace efficiency, and helps to develop people.</li><br>
				
				<li>Provide adequate support, and be available to answer questions. Ensure the project&#39;s success through ongoing communication and monitoring as well as provision of resources and credit.</li><br>
				
				<li>Focus on results. Concern yourself with what is accomplished, rather than detailing how the work should be done: Your way is not necessarily the only or even the best way! Allow the person to control his or her own methods and processes. This facilitates success and trust.</li><br>
				
				<li>Avoid &#8216;upward delegation&#8217;. If there is a problem, don&#39;t allow the person to shift responsibility for the task back to you: ask for recommended solutions; and don&#39;t simply provide an answer.</li><br>
				
				<li>Build motivation and commitment. Discuss how success will impact financial rewards, future opportunities, informal recognition, and other desirable consequences. Provide recognition where deserved.</li><br>
				
				<li>Establish and maintain control.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Discuss timelines and deadlines.</li>
					<li>Agree on a schedule of checkpoints at which you&#39;ll review project progress.</li>
					<li>Make adjustments as necessary.</li>
					<li>Take time to review all submitted work.</li>
				</ul>
			</ol>
			
			<p>In thoroughly considering these key points prior to and during the delegation process you will find that you delegate more successfully.</p>
			
			<h4>Keeping Control</h4>
			
			<p>Now, once you have worked through the above steps, make sure you brief your team member appropriately. Take time to explain why they were chosen for the job, what&#39;s expected from them during the project, the goals you have for the project, all timelines and deadlines and the resources on which they can draw. And agree a schedule for checking&#45;in with progress updates.</p>
			
			<p>Lastly, make sure that the team member knows that you want to know if any problems occur, and that you are available for any questions or guidance needed as the work progresses.</p>
			
			<p>We all know that as managers, we shouldn&#39;t micro-manage. However, this doesn&#39;t mean we must abdicate control altogether: In delegating effectively, we have to find the sometimes&#45;difficult balance between giving enough space for people to use their abilities to best effect, while still monitoring and supporting closely enough to ensure that the job is done correctly and effectively.</p>
			
			<h4>The Importance of Full Acceptance</h4>
			
			<p>When delegated work is delivered back to you, set aside enough time to review it thoroughly. If possible, only accept good quality, fully&#45;complete work. If you accept work you are not satisfied with, your team member does not learn to do the job properly. Worse than this, you accept a whole new tranche of work that you will probably need to complete yourself. Not only does this</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">39</span></div>
			
			<p>overload you, it means that you don&#39;t have the time to do your own job properly. Of course, when good work is returned to you, make sure to both recognize and reward the effort. As a leader, you should get in the practice of complimenting members of your team every time you are impressed by what they have done. This effort on your part will go a long way toward building team member&#39;s self&#45;confidence and efficiency, both of which will be improved on the next delegated task; hence, you both win.</p>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>At first sight, delegation can feel like more hassle than it&#39;s worth, however by delegating effectively, you can hugely expand the amount of work that you can deliver.</p>
			
			<p>When you arrange the workload so that you are working on the tasks that have the highest priority for you, and other people are working on meaningful and challenging assignments, you have a recipe for success.</p>
			
			<p>To delegate effectively, choose the right tasks to delegate, identify the right people to delegate to, and delegate in the right way. There&#39;s a lot to this, but you&#39;ll achieve so much more once you&#39;re delegating effectively!</p>

		<section class="subsection" data-number="11" data-name="Task Allocation">
			<h3>Task Allocation</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Picking the right player for the right job</div>
			
			<p>In any team sport, a lot of time is spent choosing the players who will play in each game. The selection process also involves deciding the position where each team member will play, based on the player&#39;s skill, form (current ability to perform well) and the likely opposition that the team will face.</p>
			
			<p>Just as this is true in sport, it is true in business. Leaders need to select the right people for the right jobs, and assign them tasks that fit with their skills and proficiencies. This provides structure.</p>
			
			<p>So how do you do this? To field a match&#45;winning team, first you need to understand the game that has to be played and the skills and abilities required to play it: There&#39;s no point asking a football team to play baseball if you want to win at the top level.</p>
			
			<p>Then you have to place the correct player in the correct position. Mere common sense, you would think &#8211; but then, as the old quip goes, &#8216;common sense is often quite uncommon&#8217;.</p>
			
			<h4>How to Use the Tool</h4>
			
			<p>Here we give you the four&#45;step &#8216;BALM&#8217; method to achieve correct role allocation:</p>
			
			<ul class="bulletless">
				<li><strong>B</strong>reak down the broader team goals into specific, individual tasks. List all tasks, and then rank each task in terms of importance;</li><br>
				<li><strong>A</strong>nalyze and list the competencies required to perform each task;</li><br>
				<li><strong>L</strong>ist the competencies of each team member;</li><br>
				<li><strong>M</strong>atch individuals to task competencies.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">40</span></div>
			
			<div class="grey-background">
				<p><strong>Tip 1:</strong><br>
				An easy way of doing this is to write down the competencies needed for each task on one color of Post&#45;It&#174; Note, and the competencies of each team member on another color of Post&#45;It Note. You can then move these around as you match people to roles.</p>
				
				<p><em>Post&#45;It&#174; is a trademark of 3M Corporation.</em></p>
			</div>
			
			<p>This is great as a starting point, but in the real world you&#39;ll most&#45;likely find lots of overlaps and lots of gaps. In such cases you have to take considered decisions.</p>
			
			<h5>Overlaps and Gaps</h5>
			
			<p>Where you have overlaps, you have two choices: Either allotting better qualified individuals to more important tasks, or allocating the task to the person at the lowest organizational level who is qualified to do the job. Both approaches have their virtues, but in different situations: One allows you to do the job with a higher level of certainty, the other allows you to do it more efficiently and at a lower cost.</p>
			
			<p>Where you have a gap, you may need to train existing team members, or recruit to fill the gap. Often, training is the best option: Not only is it usually cheaper, you also know more about the individual&#39;s talents and working methods. On the downside, a newly trained person usually has plenty of theory, but lacks the experience of putting that training into practice.</p>
			
			<p>Recruitment often takes a very long time (time to agree the role internally, advertise it, screen resumes, interview candidates, select, wait for notice periods to be served, train the individual in organizational methods, and so on) and can be very expensive. It is also risky: Even using the best interviewing and testing methods, it&#39;s possible for candidates to cover up failings that only become obvious once someone&#39;s been in a role for several months.</p>
			
			<div class="grey-background">
				<p><strong>Tip 2:</strong><br>
				A useful piece of advice handed down from generation to generation of manager is to &#8216;never underestimate the value of team spirit, motivation and hard work&#8217;. (This advice usually also concludes &#8216;And never over&#45;estimate people&#39;s knowledge and understanding&#8217;.)</p>
				
				<p><strong>Tip 3:</strong><br>
				However if someone is letting the team down, you need to be active in managing this. Non- performers set a poor example to the team, and block performance of activities that are essential for success.</p>
				
				<p>Make sure that you talk to the person who is failing to perform to make them aware of the situation. And make sure that you quickly understand and remove any blocks on performance. Give a controlled number of short but fair opportunities to perform as required (being &#8216;hard nosed&#8217; about this, correcting a situation bears results much more quickly than recruiting new team members). However, if performance doesn&#39;t improve to satisfactory levels, then the non&#45;performer needs to be moved off the team.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h5>Briefing Each Team Member</h5>
			
			<p>Having decided which team member will fill each role, you have to communicate the decision to your team.</p>
			
			<p>Each team member should know his or her position within the team. The roles of each person should be clearly defined, with individual responsibilities, authority and accountability clearly spelled out (it&#39;s often best to do this in writing).</p>
			
			<p>A hint to remember is that no member of your team should be thinking:</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">41</span></div>
			
			<ul>
				<li>What are we here for?</li>
				<li>What are we supposed to do?</li>
				<li>What part can I play?</li>
			</ul>
			
			<div class="grey-background">
				<p><strong>Tip 4:</strong><br>
				Keep your team lean, but make sure you have back&#45;ups or substitutes for key roles. It is important to have &#8216;a few good people&#8217; rather than have &#8216;too many people&#8217. But remember to have back&#45;ups in case you lose key people.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Tip 5:</strong><br>
				Research shows that diverse teams can be more successful than teams with a very similar background. People in diverse teams bring different experiences, are less prone to &#8216;group&#45;think&#8217; and tend to suffer less from the conflicts that can arise when similar people work together.</p>
				
				<p>(That said, be careful with some of the team design schemes in common use &#8211; the research base for some them is quite weak).</p>

		<section class="subsection" data-number="12" data-name="The GROW Model">
			<h3>The GROW Model</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Coaching team members to improve performance</div>
			
			<p>One key role of any leader is to coach team members to achieve their best. As &#8216;coach&#8217;, you will typically help your team members to solve problems, make better decisions, learn new skills or otherwise progress in their role or career.</p>
			
			<p>Whilst some leaders are fortunate enough to get formal training as coaches, many are not. They have to develop coaching skills for themselves.</p>
			
			<p>Now this may sound daunting. But if you arm yourself with some of proven techniques, find opportunities to practice and learn to trust your instincts, you can become a better coach, and so enhance your team&#39;s performance.</p>
			
			<p>One proven approach that helps with this it the GROW model. GROW is an acronym standing for <strong>G</strong>oal &#8211; Current <strong>R</strong>eality &#8211; <strong>O</strong>ptions &#8211; <strong>W</strong>ill. The model is a simple yet powerful framework for structuring a coaching session.</p>
			
			<p>A useful metaphor for the GROW model is the plan you might make for an important journey. First, you start with a the map: With this, you help your team member decide where they are going (their Goal) and establish where they currently are (their Current Reality). Then you explore various ways (the Options) of making the journey. In the final step, establishing the Will, you ensure your team member is committed to making the journey and is prepared for the conditions and obstacles they may meet on their way.</p>
			
			<div class="grey-background">
				<p><strong>Tip 1: Know Your Own Role</strong><br>
				In its traditional application, the GROW model assumes that the coach is not an expert in the &#8216;client&#39;s&#8217; situation, and therefore must act as an objective facilitator, helping the client select the best options and not offering advice or direction.</p>
				
				<p>However, when a leader coaches his or her team members, other dynamics are in play: As a leader you will usually have some expert knowledge to offer (see our article on expert power.) Also, it&#39;s your job to guide the selection of options which are best for your organization, and veto options that are harmful.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">42</span></div>
			
			<h4>How to Use the Tool</h4>
			
			<p>Use the following steps to structure a coaching session:</p>
			
			<ol class="indent-outside">
				<li><em>Establish the Goal:</em></li>
				
				<p>First, with your team member, you must define and agree the goal or outcome to be achieved. You should help your team member define a goal that is specific, measurable and realistic.</p>
				
				<p>In doing this, it is useful to ask questions like:</p>
				
				<ul class="bulletless">
					<li>&#8216;How will you know that you have achieved that goal?&#8217;</li>
					<li>&#8216;How will you know the problem is solved?&#8217;</li>
				</ul><br>
				
				<li><em>Examine Current Reality:</em></li>
				
				<p>Next, ask your team member to describe their Current Reality. This is a very important step: Too often, people try to solve a problem without fully considering their starting point, and often they are missing some of the information they need to solve the problem effectively.</p>
				
				<p>As the team member tells you about his or her Current Reality, the solution may start to emerge.</p>
				
				<p>Useful coaching questions include:</p>
				
				<ul class="bulletless">
					<li>&#8216;What is happening now?&#8217;</li>
					<li>&#8216;What, who, when, how often&#8217;</li>
					<li>&#8216;What is the effect or result of that?&#8217;</li>
				</ul><br>
				
				<li><em>Explore the Options:</em></li>
				
				<p>Once you and your team member have explored the Current Reality, it&#39;s time to explore what is possible &#45; meaning, all the many possible options you have for solving the problem. Help your team member generate as many good options as possible, and discuss these.</p>
				
				<p>By all means, offer your own suggestions. But let your team member offer his or hers first, and let him or her do most of the talking.</p>
				
				<p>Typical questions used to establish the options are:</p>
				
				<ul class="bulletless">
					<li>&#8216;What else could you do?&#8217;</li>
					<li>&#8216;What if this or that constraint were removed?&#8217;</li>
					<li>&#8216;What are the benefits and downsides of each option?&#8217;</li>
					<li>&#8216;What factors will you use to weigh up the options?&#8217;</li>
				</ul><br>
				
				<li><em>Establish the Will:</em></li>
				
				<p>By examining Current Reality and exploring the Options, your team member will now have a good idea of how he or she can achieve their Goal. That&#39;s great &#8211; but in itself, this may not be enough! So your final step as coach is to get you team member to commit to</p>
			</ol>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">43</span></div>
			
			<ol class="indent-outside">
				<p>specific action. In so doing, you will help the team member establish his or her will and motivation.</p>
				
				<p>Useful questions:</p>
				
				<ul class="bulletless">
					<li>&#8216;So what will you do now and when?&#8217;</li>
					<li>&#8216;What could stop you moving forward?&#8217;</li>
					<li>&#8216;And how will you overcome it?&#8217;</li>
					<li>&#8216;Will this address your goal?&#8217;</li>
					<li>&#8216;How likely is this option to succeed?&#8217;</li>
					<li>&#8216;What else will you do?&#8217;</li>

			<h3>Mentoring: An Essential Leadership Skill</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Mentoring from a mentor&#39;s perspective</div>
			
			<p>Mentoring is an essential leadership skill. In addition to managing and motivating people, it&#39;s also important that you can help others learn, grow and become more effective in their jobs. You can do this through a mentoring partnership, which you can arrange within your organization or through a personal or professional network, like the Mind Tools Mentor Network for Premium members of our Career Excellence Club.</p>
			
			<p>Should you become a mentor? And what do you need to consider before setting up a mentoring relationship? In this article, we&#39;ll highlight some things a mentor does and doesn&#39;t do, and we'll help you decide whether mentoring is right for you.</p>
			
			<h4>Becoming a Mentor</h4>
			
			<p>Mentoring can be a rewarding experience for you, both personally and professionally. You can improve your leadership and communication skills, learn new perspectives and ways of thinking, advance your career, and gain a great sense of personal satisfaction.</p>
			
			<p>To learn more about the advantages of mentoring, see Mentoring: A Mutually Beneficial Partnership.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">44</span></div>
			
			<h4>Is Mentoring Right for You?</h4>
			
			<p>Even if you understand the benefits of mentoring and it sounds like a great idea, you have to decide whether it&#39;s right for you. To explore your reasons for mentoring and whether you want to take this type of commitment further, ask yourself these questions:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Do you want to share your knowledge and experience with others?</li>
				<li>Do you enjoy encouraging and motivating others?</li>
				<li>Are you comfortable asking challenging questions?</li>
				<li>Do you want to contribute to other people's growth and success?</li>
				<li>Are you prepared to invest your time in mentoring on a regular basis?</li>
				<li>How will mentoring contribute toward your own career goals?</li>
				<li>How will mentoring add to your sense of contribution and community?</li>
				<li>What type of person do you ideally want to mentor? Can you describe the professional and
personal qualities of this person? Do you want someone from the same profession or the same career path?</li>
				<li>In what areas are you willing to help? Are there any areas that you don't want to go near?</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Clarify your reasons and motivations for becoming a mentor. When you meet a prospective mentee, this will help you assess your compatibility.</p>
			
			<h4>What You Should Consider</h4>
			
			<p>Although you may want to jump right in with both feet, think about these practical considerations:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Frequency of contact</strong> &#8211; How much time can you commit to this relationship?</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Can you &#8216;meet&#8217; weekly? Biweekly? Once a month?</li>
						<li>How long can you spend in each meeting? Half an hour? An hour? More?</li>
						<li>Do you want to be available between &#8216;formal&#8217; sessions?</li>
					</ul>
				
				<li><strong>Method of contact</strong> &#8211; Would you prefer face&#45;to&#45;face meetings, phone calls, or emails? If you were to use phone calls, who places the call? Can you both use an Internet phone service such as Skype (giving high quality, free local and international calls)?</li>
				
				<li><strong>Duration of partnership</strong> &#8211; Do you want to limit the length of the mentoring partnership? Do you want to set regular intervals to review whether you're both happy with the relationship, or do you just want to informally review progress on an ongoing basis?</li>
				
				<li><strong>Skills, knowledge, and experience</strong> &#8211; What specific expertise can you offer to a mentee?</li>
				
				<li><strong>Confidentiality</strong> &#8211; How will you approach confidential business information? Think of ways to speak about general concepts and situations while maintaining confidentiality.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Where to Draw the Line</h4>
			
			<p>When developing a mentoring partnership, make sure you have clear boundaries of what you can and cannot do for the mentee.</p>
			
			<p>Answer the above questions to help you clearly define these boundaries for yourself. Then, when you meet your potential mentee, you&#39;ll better understand your own mindset &#8211; what areas you're interested in covering, and what you will and will not do.</p>
			
			<p>Take the lead on where you&#39;ll allow the mentoring relationship to go and what ground you&#39;ll cover. As a general guide, focus on your expertise and experience. If anything is beyond your skills and abilities, refer the mentee to another expert.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">45</span></div>
			
			<p>For example, if a discussion about human resources issues raises a concern about employment law, send your mentee to an internal expert or attorney. If conversations about work problems lead into personal or family problems, the mentee may need more focused professional help from a psychologist or therapist.</p>
			
			<p>As a mentor, you can become the mentee&#39;s confidante and adviser. You may be called upon to be a &#8216;sounding board&#8217; for all sorts of issues and concerns. So know in advance how you're going to deal with difficult situations and getting &#8216;off subject.&#8217;</p>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>A mentoring partnership can be an enriching experience. You can develop your leadership and communication skills as well as contribute toward your own career advancement.</p>
			
			<p>Mentoring can also give you a great overall sense of personal satisfaction, knowing that you're helping someone else learn and grow on a professional and personal level.</p>
			
			<p>Before you begin a mentoring partnership, it's important to think about your reasons for becoming a mentor and the practical considerations and logistics of such a relationship. If you decide that mentoring is right for you, the time and effort that you put into it can reap great rewards that far exceed your expectations.</p>

			<p>As you responded to the statements, you probably had some insight into areas where the motivational practices you use could use a pick&#45;me&#45;up. The following is a quick summary of the main areas of motivation that were explored in the quiz, and a guide to the specific tools you can use for each.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Providing Productive and Challenging Work</strong> (Statements 1, 4, 15)</p>
			
			<p>Your score out of 15: _______</p>
			
			<p>The first step in building a highly motivated team is providing interesting work, which is well organized to meet the needs and desires of team members. No matter how self&#45;motivated a person is, how challenging the goals he or she sets, or how wonderful the rewards, if the work is badly designed, it will be hard to motivate people and work will be less than ideal.</p>
			
			<p>Effective motivators understand that work design has a strong impact on performance. When a person finds a job inherently unsatisfying, there&#39;s not much you can do to motivate him or her. Job design and enrichment combine to match characteristics of the job with workers&#39; skills and interests: The more variety, challenge and autonomy there is to a job, the more intrinsically satisfying it will be.</p>
			
			<p>Our article on Job Enrichment details how to set up meaningful work assignments. Other articles of interest include Pygmalion Motivation, which addresses the impact that your work assignments have on conscious and unconscious motivators, and Dealing with Poor Performance, which outlines steps that you can take to ensure you have a good fit between the person and the job.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Setting Effective Goals</strong> (Statements 2, 3, 12, 14)</p>
			
			<p>Your score out of 20: _______</p>
			
			<p>When you are confident that the work you provide is well organized, the next thing to do is to ensure that workers have clear and attainable goals that they&#39;re working to achieve. Managing the goal setting process is essential for creating a highly motivating environment. The effectiveness of goal setting in motivation is a well&#45;recognized fact, and by making goals specific, consistent, and appropriately challenging, you can set goals that are powerfully motivating. As such, the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time&#45;bound) acronym helps you define effective goals.</p>
			
			<p>Specific goals are measurable, unambiguous and behavior&#45;changing. They outline exactly what needs to be accomplished, and when it will be considered as &#8216;achieved&#8217;. Having goals that are consistent with other personal goals as well as organizational goals is also important. If goals are inconsistent, the resulting confusion and incompatibility would like cause the person to do nothing rather than work in different directions.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">48</span></div>
			
			<p>For more on goal setting, read our articles on Locke&#39;s Goal Setting, which explains the principle of setting SMART goals; Management By Objectives, which details how to align personal goals with those of the organization; Performance Management and KPIs and Performance Agreements.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, challenge is important, due to the observation that we get what we expect. Up to a point, the more you expect from someone, the harder they will generally work. This has been shown time and again, and is explained by the idea of Expectancy Theory: The idea here is that you need to link high effort with high performance, and high performance with a positive outcome. With those two linkages established, people are motivated to work hard to achieve a positive outcome. Read more in our article on Expectancy Theory.</p>
			
			<div class="grey-background">
				<p><strong>Tip:</strong><br>
				Think carefully about the goals you set, and make sure you adapt them to circumstances in a reasonable way. If you&#39;re too rigid with your goals, you may motivate members of your team to &#8216;cut corners&#8217; in order to reach them.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p><strong>Understanding Individual Differences in Motivation</strong> (Statements 5, 9, 10, 11)</p>
			
			<p>Your score out of 20: _______</p>
			
			<p>Motivational techniques should bring out the best in people. That means they should build on an individual&#39;s strengths and minimize his or her weaknesses.</p>
			
			<p>There are certainly some common denominators in motivation, like fair wages, decent working conditions, a sense of camaraderie with co&#45;workers, and a good relationship with one&#39;s supervisor. Abraham Maslow and Frederick Herzberg are two famous motivation theorists who established that even if these sorts of things are not necessarily motivating in themselves, they have to be present in order to even think about enhancing motivation.</p>
			
			<p>However, the assumption in most modern workplaces is that these lower order, &#8216;hygiene&#8217; factors are being met, and that people are seeking the things that provide real motivation. These are things like challenging work, control, growth opportunities, and recognition for a job well done.</p>
			
			<p>To decide which motivating factors to provide you need to look at the individual employees. Some will be motivated by more time off, while others may prefer to gain status and recognition in the company. Understanding these individual needs is mandatory for building a motivating workplace, and is why question 11 above is a &#8216;trick question&#8217;: if you try to motivate everyone in exactly the same way, you&#39;re likely missing plenty of opportunities for motivating individual members of your team.</p>
			
			<p>Meeting peoples&#39; needs, providing challenge, using a variety of rewards, and matching them to the right people are issues discussed in the following articles: Using Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy, Herzberg&#39;s Motivators and Hygiene Factors, Alderfer&#39;s ERG Theory, Theory X and Theory Y, Adam&#39;s Equity Theory, and Expectancy Theory.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Providing Rewards and Recognition</strong> (Statements 6, 7, 8, 13)</p>
			
			<p>Your score out of 20: _______</p>
			
			<p>When you know what you want to provide in terms of reward and recognition, it&#39;s important to establish an effective system. The primary focus of a reward system is fairness. Both reward and discipline have to be perceived as fairly distributed according to clear guidelines. This is why setting specific performance expectations is so important. (&#8216;Fairness&#8217; doesn&#39;t mean that everyone has the same reward package &#8211; it means that differences between people&#39;s reward packages need to be clear and understandable.)</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">49</span></div>
			
			<p>It is equally important to make sure you give your team members the tools they need to be successful. If you&#39;re setting goals, then you need to make sure that they are attainable, and you do that by providing the necessary support, tools, resources, and training.</p>
			
			<p>It&#39;s also important that you get to understand the challenges your team faces. This way you can appreciate the small victories that lead to the major accomplishments. Motivation is all about encouragement and appreciation.</p>
			
			<p>When you are part of the team and not simply an &#8216;observer from above&#8217; you will have many opportunities to thank people and recognize good work right on the spot. This is a really important factor in successful recognition. You have to be in a position to show or tell people everyday that you appreciate their contributions. <strong>Once or twice a year in formal review process is not enough!</strong></p>
			
			<p>To help you understand these key concepts and develop a great reward system, learn to use the following tools: Management By Walking Around, DILO (Day In The Life Of), Expectancy Theory, and &#8216;A Bit of Perfume&#8217; &#8211; Giving Praise.</p>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>If you want to build a high performance team, then you absolutely have to learn how to motivate team members. Side benefits of this include high levels of team&#45;member job satisfaction, and good staff retention.</p>
			
			<p>You can stimulate high performance through providing interesting and challenging work, helping people set and achieve meaningful goals, and recognizing and rewarding high performance in ways that are valued by each individual.</p>
			
			<p>Making a point of motivating people is a challenge in and of itself. Once you decide you are up to it, however, you too will reap the rewards and benefits. This creates a momentum that will help you and your team achieve great success.</p>

		<section class="subsection" data-number="15" data-name="Herzberg's Motivators and Hygiene Factors">
			<h3>Herzberg&#39;s Motivators and Hygiene Factors</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Learning how to motivate your team</div>
			
			<p>What do people want from their jobs?</p>
			
			<p>Do they want just a higher salary? Or do they want security, good relationships with co&#45;workers, opportunities for growth and advancement &#8211; or something else altogether?</p>

			<p>This is an important question, because it&#39;s at the root of motivation, the art of engaging with members of your team in such a way that they give their very best performance.</p>

			<p>The psychologist Fredrick Herzberg asked the same question in the 1950s and 60s as a means of understanding employee satisfaction. He set out to determine the effect of attitude on motivation, by asking people to describe situations where they felt really good, and really bad, about their jobs. What he found was that people who felt good about their jobs gave very different responses from the people who felt bad.</p>
			
			<p>These results form the basis of Herzberg&#39;s Motivation&#45;Hygiene Theory (sometimes known as Herzberg&#39;s Two Factor Theory.) Published in his famous article &#8216;One More Time: How do You Motivate Employees&#8217;, the conclusions he drew were extraordinarily influential, and still form the bedrock of good motivational practice nearly half a century later.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">50</span></div>
			
			<h4>Motivation&#45;Hygiene Theory</h4>
			
			<p>Herzberg&#39;s findings revealed that certain characteristics of a job are consistently related to job satisfaction, while different factors are associated with job dissatisfaction. These are:</p>
			
			<table class="side-by-side">
				<tr>
					<th>Factors for Satisfaction</th>
					<th>Factors for Dissatisfaction</th>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td><p>Achievement</p><p>Recognition</p><p>The work itself</p><p>Responsibility</p><p>Advancement</p><p>Growth</p></td>
					<td><p>Company</p><p>Policies</p><p>Supervision</p><p>Relationship with Supervisor and Peers</p><p>Work conditions</p><p>Salary</p><p>Status</p><p>Security</p></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>The conclusion he drew is that job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction are not opposites.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The opposite of Satisfaction is No Satisfaction.</li>
				<li>The opposite of Dissatisfaction is No Dissatisfaction.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Remedying the causes of dissatisfaction will not create satisfaction. Nor will adding the factors of job satisfaction eliminate job dissatisfaction. If you have a hostile work environment, giving someone a promotion will not make him or her satisfied. If you create a healthy work environment but do not provide members of your team with any of the satisfaction factors, the work they&#39;re doing will still not be satisfying.</p>
			
			<p>According to Herzberg, the factors leading to job satisfaction are &#8216;separate and distinct from those that lead to job dissatisfaction.&#8217; Therefore, if you set about eliminating dissatisfying job factors you may create peace, but not necessarily enhance performance. This placates your workforce instead of actually motivating them to improve performance.</p>
			
			<p>The characteristics associated with job dissatisfaction are called hygiene factors. When these have been adequately, people will not be dissatisfied nor will they be satisfied. If you want to motivate your team, you then have to focus on satisfaction factors like achievement, recognition, and responsibility.</p>
			
			<div class="grey-background">
				<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>
				Despite its wide acceptance, Herzberg&#39;s theory has its detractors. Some say its methodology does not address the notion that when things are going well people tend to look at the things they enjoy about their job. When things are going badly, however, they tend to blame external factors.</p>
				
				<p>Another common criticism is the fact that the theory assumes a strong correlation between job satisfaction and productivity. Herzberg&#39;s methodology did not address this relationship, therefore this assumption needs to be correct for his findings to have practical relevance.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">51</span></div>
			
			<p>To apply Herzberg&#39;s theory, you need to adopt a two stage process to motivate people. Firstly, you need eliminate the dissatisfactions they're experiencing and, secondly, you need to help them find satisfaction.</p>
			
			<h5>Step One: Eliminate Job Dissatisfaction</h5>
			
			<p>Herzberg called the causes of dissatisfaction &#8216;hygiene factors&#8217;. To get rid of them, you need to:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Fix poor and obstructive company policies.</li>
				<li>Provide effective, supportive and non-intrusive supervision.</li>
				<li>Create and support a culture of respect and dignity for all team members.</li>
				<li>Ensure that wages are competitive.</li>
				<li>Build job status by providing meaningful work for all positions.</li>
				<li>Provide job security.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>All of these actions help you eliminate job dissatisfaction in your organization. And there's no point trying to motivate people until these issues are out of the way!</p>
			
			<p>You can&#39;t stop there, though. Remember, just because someone is not dissatisfied, it doesn&#39;t mean he or she is satisfied either! Now you have to turn your attention to building job satisfaction.</p>
			
			<h5>Step Two: Create Conditions for Job Satisfaction</h5>
			
			<p>To create satisfaction, Herzberg says you need to address the motivating factors associated with work. He called this &#8216;job enrichment&#8217;. His premise was that every job should be examined to determine how it could be made better and more satisfying to the person doing the work. Things to consider include:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Providing opportunities for achievement.</li>
				<li>Recognizing workers&#39; contributions.</li>
				<li>Creating work that is rewarding and that matches the skills and abilities of the worker.</li>
				<li>Giving as much responsibility to each team member as possible.</li>
				<li>Providing opportunities to advance in the company through internal promotions.</li>
				<li>Offering training and development opportunities, so that people can pursue the positions they want within the company.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<div class="grey-background">
				<p><strong>Tip 1:</strong><br>
				Here we&#39;re approaching the subject of motivation in a very general way. In reality, you&#39;ll need &#8216;different strokes for different folks&#8217; &#8211; in other words, different people will perceive different issues, and will be motivated by different things. Make sure you talk with your people regularly on a one&#45;to&#45;one basis to find out what matters to them.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Tip 2:</strong><br>
				Herzberg&#39;s theory is largely responsible for the practice of allowing people greater responsibility for planning and controlling their work, as a means of increasing motivation and satisfaction. To learn more about this, see the Mind Tools article on job enrichment.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>The relationship between motivation and job satisfaction is not overly complex. The problem is that many employers look at the hygiene factors as ways to motivate when in fact, beyond the very short term, they do very little to motivate.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">52</span></div>
			
			<p>Perhaps managers like to use this approach because they think people are more financially motivated than, perhaps, they are, or perhaps it just takes less management effort to raise wages than it does to reevaluate company policy, and redesign jobs for maximum satisfaction.</p>
			
			<p>When you&#39;re seeking to motivate people, firstly get rid of the things that are annoying them about the company and the workplace. Make sure they're treated fairly, and with respect.</p>
			
			<p>Once you&#39;ve done this, look for ways in which you can help people grow within their jobs, give them opportunities for achievement, and praise that achievement wherever you find it.</p>
			
			<div class="yellow-background">
				<div class="grey-header">Apply This to Your Life</div>
				
				<p>If you lead a team, take a little time with each of the members of your team to check that they're happy, that they think they're being fairly and respectfully treated, and that they're not being affected by unnecessary bureaucracy.</p>
				
				<p>You may be horrified by what you find once you start probing (bureaucracy, in particular, has a way of spreading), however you may be able to improve things quickly if you put your mind to it.</p>
				
				<p>Then find out what they want from their jobs, do what you can to give this to them, and help them grow as individuals.</p>
				
				<p>If you do this systematically, you'll be amazed by the impact this has on motivation!</p>

		<section class="subsection" data-number="16" data-name="Adams’ Equity Theory">
			<h3>Adams&#39; Equity Theory</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Balancing employee inputs and outputs</div>
			
			<p>Adams&#39; Equity Theory calls for a fair balance to be struck between an employee&#39;s inputs (hard work, skill level, tolerance, enthusiasm, etc.) and an employee&#39;s outputs (salary, benefits, intangibles such as recognition, etc.). According to the theory, finding this fair balance serves to ensure a strong and productive relationship is achieved with the employee, with the overall result being contented, motivated employees.</p>
			
			<h4>The Theory Summarized</h4>
			
			<p>The Adams&#39; Equity Theory is named for John Stacey Adams, a workplace and behavioral psychologist, who developed this job motivation theory in 1963.</p>
			
			<p>Much like many of the more prevalent theories of motivation (theories by Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs, Herzberg&#39;s Theory, etc.), the Adams&#39; Equity Theory acknowledges that subtle and variable factors affect an employee&#39;s assessment and perception of their relationship with their work and their employer.</p>
			
			<p>The theory is built&#45;on the belief that employees become de&#45;motivated, both in relation to their job and their employer, if they feel as though their inputs are greater than the outputs. Employees can be expected to respond to this is different ways, including de&#45;motivation (generally to the extent the employee perceives the disparity between the inputs and the outputs exist), reduced effort, becoming disgruntled, or, in more extreme cases, perhaps even disruptive.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">53</span></div>
			
			<h4>How to Apply the Adams&#39; Equity Theory</h4>
			
			<p>It is important to also consider the Adams&#39; Equity Theory factors when striving to improve an employee&#39;s job satisfaction, motivation level, etc., and what can be done to promote higher levels of each.</p>
			
			<p>To do this, consider the balance or imbalance that currently exists between your employee&#39;s inputs and outputs, as follows:</p>
			
			<p>Inputs typically include:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Effort</li>
				<li>Loyalty</li>
				<li>Hard Work</li>
				<li>Commitment</li>
				<li>Skill</li>
				<li>Ability</li>
				<li>Adaptability</li>
				<li>Flexibility</li>
				<li>Tolerance</li>
				<li>Determination</li>
				<li>Enthusiasm</li>
				<li>Trust in superiors</li>
				<li>Support of colleagues</li>
				<li>Personal sacrifice</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Outputs typically include:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Financial rewards (salary, benefits, perks, etc.)</li>
				<li>Intangibles that typically include:</li>
				
				<ul style="list-style:disc;">
					<li>Recognition</li>
					<li>Reputation</li>
					<li>Responsibility</li>
					<li>Sense of Achievement</li>
					<li>Praise</li>
					<li>Stimulus</li>
					<li>Sense of Advancement/Growth</li>
					<li>Job Security</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			
			<p>While obviously many of these points can&#39;t be quantified and perfectly compared, the theory argues that managers should seek to find a fair balance between the inputs that an employee gives, and the outputs received.</p>
			
			<p>And according to the theory, employees should be content where they perceive these to be in balance.</p>
			
			<div class="grey-background">
				<p><strong>Tip:</strong><br>
				Frederick Herzberg&#39;s Motivation/Hygiene Theory, which is similar to this. While Adams&#39; Equity Theory obviously has a strong element of truth to it, it's probably fair to say that Herzberg&#39;s Motivation/Hygiene Theory has greater motivational significance.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">54</span></div>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>Much like the five levels of needs determined by Maslow and the two factors of motivation as classified by Herzberg (intrinsic and extrinsic), the Adams&#39; Equity Theory of motivation states that positive outcomes and high levels of motivation can be expected only when employees perceive their treatment to be fair. An employee&#39;s perception of this may include many factors (see outputs above). The idea behind Adams&#39; Equity Theory is to strike a healthy balance here, with outputs on one side of the scale; inputs on the other &#8211; both weighing in a way that seems reasonably equal.</p>
			
			<p>If the balance lies too far in favor of the employer, some employees may work to bring balance between inputs and outputs on their own, by asking for more compensation or recognition. Others will be demotivated, and still others will seek alternative employment.</p>

			<h3>Avoiding Micromanagement</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Helping team members excel &#8211; on their own</div>
			
			<p>You&#39;ve assigned an important task to a talented employee, and given him a deadline. Now, do you let him do his work and simply touch base with him at pre&#45;defined points along the way &#8211; or do you keep dropping by his desk and sending e&#45;mails to check his progress?</p>
			
			<p>If it&#39;s the latter, you might be a micromanager. Or, if you're the harried worker trying to make a deadline with a boss hovering at your shoulder, you might have a micromanager on your hands &#8211; someone who just can&#39;t let go of tiny details.</p>
			
			<p>Micromanagers take perfectly positive attributes &#8211; an attention to detail and a hands&#45;on attitude &#8211; to the extreme. Either because they&#39;re control&#45;obsessed, or because they feel driven to push everyone around them to success, micromanagers risk disempowering their colleagues. They ruin their colleagues&#39; confidence, hurt their performance, and frustrate them to the point where they quit.</p>
			
			<p>Luckily, though, there are ways to identify these overzealous tendencies in yourself &#8211; and get rid of them before they do more damage. And if you work for a micromanager, there are strategies you can use to convince him or her to accept your independence.</p>
			
			<p>First, though, how do you spot the signs of micromanagement? Where is the line between being an involved manager, and an over&#45;involved manager who's driving his team mad?</p>
			
			<h4>Signs of micromanagement</h4>
			
			<p>What follows are some signs that you might be a micromanager &#8211; or have one on your hands. In general, micromanagers:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Resist delegating.</li>
				<li>Immerse themselves in overseeing the projects of others.</li>
				<li>Start by correcting tiny details instead of looking at the big picture.</li>
				<li>Take back delegated work before it is finished if they find a mistake in it.</li>
				<li>Discourage others from making decisions without consulting them.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>What's wrong with micromanaging?</h4>
			
			<p>If you are getting results by micromanaging and keeping your nose in everyone&#39;s business, why not carry on?</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">55</span></div>
			
			<p>Micromanagers often affirm the value of their approach with a simple experiment: They give an employee an assignment, and then disappear until the deadline. Is this employee likely to excel when given free rein?</p>
			
			<p>Possibly &#8211; if the worker has exceptional confidence in his abilities. Under micromanagement, however, most workers become timid and tentative &#8211; possibly even paralyzed. &#8216;No matter what I do,&#8217; such a worker might think to himself, &#8216;It won&#39;t be good enough.&#8217; Then one of two things will happen: Either the worker will ask the manager for guidance before the deadline, or he will forge ahead, but come up with an inadequate result.</p>
			
			<p>In either case, the micromanager will interpret the result of his experiment as proof that, without his constant intervention, his people will flounder or fail.</p>
			
			<p>But do these results verify the value of micromanagement &#8211; or condemn it? A truly effective manager sets up those around him to succeed. Micromanagers, on the other hand, prevent employees from making &#8211; and taking responsibility for &#8211; their own decisions. But it&#39;s precisely the process of making decisions, and living with the consequences, that causes people to grow and improve.</p>
			
			<p>Good managers empower their employees to do well by giving opportunities to excel; Bad managers disempower their employees by hoarding those opportunities. And a disempowered employee is an ineffective one &#8211; one who requires a lot of time and energy from his supervisor.</p>
			
			<p>It&#39;s that time and energy, multiplied across a whole team of timid, cowed workers, that amounts to a serious and self&#45;defeating drain on a manager&#39;s time. It&#39;s extremely difficult, if not impossible, to keep up with analysis, planning, communication with other teams, and the other &#8216;big&#45;picture&#8217; tasks of managing, when you are sweating the details of the next sales presentation.</p>
			
			<h4>Escaping Micromanagement</h4>
			
			<p>So now you&#39;ve identified micro&#45;managerial tendencies and seen why they&#39;re bad. What can you do if you know you're exhibiting such behaviors &#8211; or are being subjected to them by a supervisor?</p>
			
			<p>From the micromanager&#39;s perspective, the best way to build healthier relationships with employees may be the most direct: Talk to them.</p>
			
			<p>It might take several conversations to convince them that you&#39;re serious about change. Getting frank feedback from employees is the hard part. Once you've done that, as executive coach Marshall Goldsmith recommends in his book What Got You Here Won&#39;t Get You There, it&#39;s time to apologize and change. This means giving your employees the leeway &#8211; and encouragement &#8211; to succeed. Focus first on the ones with the most potential, and learn to delegate effectively to them. Read our article on delegation for more about this.</p>

			<div class="grey-background">
				<p><strong>Tip:</strong><br>
				Part of being a good manager, one often lost on those of the micro variety, is listening. Managers fail to listen when they forget their employees have important insights &#8211; and people who don&#39;t feel listened to become disengaged.</p>
			</div>
				
			<p>As for the micromanaged, well, things are a bit more complicated. Likely as not, you&#39;re being held back in your professional development &#8211; and probably not making the progress in your career that you could be if you enjoyed workplace independence.</p>
				
			<p>But there's a certain amount that you can do to improve the situation:</p>
				
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">56</span></div>
				
			<ul>
				<li>Help your boss to delegate to you more effectively by prompting him to give you all the information you will need up front, and to set interim review points along the way.</li>
				<li>Volunteer to take on work or projects that you&#39;re confident you&#39;ll be good at. This will start to increase his confidence in you &#8211; and his delegation skills.</li>
				<li>Make sure that you communicate progress to your boss regularly, to discourage him from seeking information just because he hasn&#39;t had any for a while.</li>
				<li>Concentrate on helping your boss to change one micromanagement habit at a time. Remember that he&#39;s only human too, and is allowed to make mistakes!</li>
				<li>Read our article on Working with Powerful People for further advice on how to manage upwards.</li>
			</ul>
				
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
				
			<p>Micromanagement restricts the ability of micromanaged people to develop and grow, and it also limits what the micromanager&#39;s team can achieve, because everything has to go through him or her.</p>
			
			<p>When a boss is reluctant to delegate, focuses on details ahead of the big picture and discourages his staff from taking the initiative, there's every chance that he&#39;s sliding towards micromanagement.</p>
				
			<p>The first step in avoiding the micromanagement trap (or getting out of it once you&#39;re there) is to recognize the danger signs by talking to your staff or boss. If you&#39;re micromanaged, help your boss see there is a better way of working. And if you are a micromanager, work hard on those delegation skills and learn to trust your staff to develop and deliver.</p>

			<h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>
			<div class="header-caption">Resolving conflict rationally and effectively</div>
			
			<p>In many cases, conflict in the workplace just seems to be a fact of life. We&#39;ve all seen situations where different people with different goals and needs have come into conflict. And we&#39;ve all seen the often&#45;intense personal animosity that can result.</p>
			
			<p>The fact that conflict exists, however, is not necessarily a bad thing: As long as it is resolved effectively, it can lead to personal and professional growth.</p>
			
			<p>In many cases, effective conflict resolution skills can make the difference between positive and negative outcomes.</p>
			
			<p>The good news is that by resolving conflict successfully, you can solve many of the problems that it has brought to the surface, as well as getting benefits that you might not at first expect:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Increased understanding:</strong> The discussion needed to resolve conflict expands people&#39;s awareness of the situation, giving them an insight into how they can achieve their own goals without undermining those of other people.</li>
				<li><strong>Increased group cohesion:</strong> When conflict is resolved effectively, team members can develop stronger mutual respect, and a renewed faith in their ability to work together.</li>
				<li><strong>Improved self&#45;knowledge:</strong> Conflict pushes individuals to examine their goals in close detail, helping them understand the things that are most important to them, sharpening their focus, and enhancing their effectiveness.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>However, if conflict is not handled effectively, the results can be damaging. Conflicting goals can quickly turn into personal dislike. Teamwork breaks down. Talent is wasted as people disengage</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">57</span></div>
			
			<p>from their work. And it's easy to end up in a vicious downward spiral of negativity and recrimination.</p>
			
			<p>If you&#39;re to keep your team or organization working effectively, you need to stop this downward spiral as soon as you can. To do this, it helps to understand two of the theories that lie behind effective conflict resolution techniques:</p>
			
			<h4>Understanding the Theory: Conflict Styles</h4>
			
			<p>In the 1970s Kenneth Thomas and Ralph Kilmann identified five main styles of dealing with conflict that vary in their degrees of cooperativeness and assertiveness. They argued that people typically have a preferred conflict resolution style. However they also noted that different styles were most useful in different situations. The Thomas&#45;Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI) helps you to identify which style you tend towards when conflict arises.</p>
			
			<p>Thomas and Kilmann&#39;s styles are:</p>
			
			<p><strong>Competitive:</strong> People who tend towards a competitive style take a firm stand, and know what they want. They usually operate from a position of power, drawn from things like position, rank, expertise, or persuasive ability. This style can be useful when there is an emergency and a decision needs to be make fast; when the decision is unpopular; or when defending against someone who is trying to exploit the situation selfishly. However it can leave people feeling bruised, unsatisfied and resentful when used in less urgent situations.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Collaborative:</strong> People tending towards a collaborative style try to meet the needs of all people involved. These people can be highly assertive but unlike the competitor, they cooperate effectively and acknowledge that everyone is important. This style is useful when a you need to bring together a variety of viewpoints to get the best solution; when there have been previous conflicts in the group; or when the situation is too important for a simple trade&#45;off.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Compromising:</strong> People who prefer a compromising style try to find a solution that will at least partially satisfy everyone. Everyone is expected to give up something, and the compromiser him&#45; or herself also expects to relinquish something. Compromise is useful when the cost of conflict is higher than the cost of losing ground, when equal strength opponents are at a standstill and when there is a deadline looming.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Accommodating:</strong> This style indicates a willingness to meet the needs of others at the expense of the person&#39;s own needs. The accommodator often knows when to give in to others, but can be persuaded to surrender a position even when it is not warranted. This person is not assertive but is highly cooperative. Accommodation is appropriate when the issues matter more to the other party, when peace is more valuable than winning, or when you want to be in a position to collect on this &#8216;favor&#8217; you gave. However people may not return favors, and overall this approach is unlikely to give the best outcomes.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Avoiding:</strong> People tending towards this style seek to evade the conflict entirely. This style is typified by delegating controversial decisions, accepting default decisions, and not wanting to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings. It can be appropriate when victory is impossible, when the controversy is trivial, or when someone else is in a better position to solve the problem. However in many situations this is a weak and ineffective approach to take.</p>
			
			<p>Once you understand the different styles, you can use them to think about the most appropriate approach (or mixture of approaches) for the situation you&#39;re in. You can also think about your own instinctive approach, and learn how you need to change this if necessary.</p>
			
			<p>Ideally you can adopt an approach that meets the situation, resolves the problem, respects people&#39;s legitimate interests, and mends damaged working relationships.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">58</span></div>
			
			<h4>Understanding the Theory: The &#8216;Interest&#45;Based Relational Approach&#8217;</h4>
			
			<p>The second theory is commonly referred to as the &#8216;Interest&#45;Based Relational (IBR) Approach&#8217;. This conflict resolution strategy respects individual differences while helping people avoid becoming too entrenched in a fixed position.</p>
			
			<p>In resolving conflict using this approach, you follow these rules:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Make sure that good relationships are the first priority:</strong> As far as possible, make sure that you treat the other calmly and that you try to build mutual respect. Do your best to be courteous to one-another and remain constructive under pressure.</li>
				<li><strong>Keep people and problems separate:</strong> Recognize that in many cases the other person is not just &#8216;being difficult&#8217; &#8211; real and valid differences can lie behind conflictive positions. By separating the problem from the person, real issues can be debated without damaging working relationships.</li>
				<li><strong>Pay attention to the interests that are being presented:</strong> By listening carefully you&#39;ll most&#45;likely understand why the person is adopting his or her position.</li>
				<li><strong>Listen first; talk second:</strong> To solve a problem effectively you have to understand where the other person is coming from before defending your own position.</li>
				<li><strong>Set out the &#8216;Facts&#8217;:</strong> Agree and establish the objective, observable elements that will have an impact on the decision.</li>
				<li><strong>Explore options together:</strong> Be open to the idea that a third position may exist, and that you can get to this idea jointly.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>By following these rules, you can often keep contentious discussions positive and constructive. This helps to prevent the antagonism and dislike which so&#45;often causes conflict to spin out of control.</p>
			
			<h4>Using the Tool: A Conflict Resolution Process</h4>
			
			<p>Based on these approaches, a starting point for dealing with conflict is to identify the overriding conflict style employed by yourself, your team or your organization.</p>
			
			<p>Over time, people&#39;s conflict management styles tend to mesh, and a &#8216;right&#8217; way to solve conflict emerges. It&#39;s good to recognize when this style can be used effectively, however make sure that people understand that different styles may suit different situations.</p>
			
			<p>Look at the circumstances, and think about the style that may be appropriate.</p>
			
			<p>Then use the process below to resolve the conflict:</p>
			
			<h5>Step One: Set the Scene</h5>
			
			<p>If appropriate to the situation, agree the rules of the IBR Approach (or at least consider using the approach yourself.) Make sure that people understand that the conflict may be a mutual problem, which may be best resolved through discussion and negotiation rather than through raw aggression.</p>
			
			<p>If you are involved in the conflict, emphasize the fact that you are presenting your perception of the problem. Use active listening skills to ensure you hear and understand other&#39;s positions and perceptions.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Restate</li>
				<li>Paraphrase</li>
				<li>Summarize</li>
			</ul>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">59</span></div>
			
			<p>And make sure that when you talk, you're using an adult, assertive approach rather than a submissive or aggressive style.</p>
			
			<h5>Step Two: Gather Information</h5>
			
			<p>Here you are trying to get to the underlying interests, needs, and concerns. Ask for the other person’s viewpoint and confirm that you respect his or her opinion and need his or her cooperation to solve the problem.</p>
			
			<p>Try to understand his or her motivations and goals, and see how your actions may be affecting these.</p>
			
			<p>Also, try to understand the conflict in objective terms: Is it affecting work performance? damaging the delivery to the client? disrupting team work? hampering decision-making? or so on. Be sure to focus on work issues and leave personalities out of the discussion.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Listen with empathy and see the conflict from the other person&#39;s point of view.</li>
				<li>Identify issues clearly and concisely.</li>
				<li>Use &#8216;I&#8217; statements.</li>
				<li>Remain flexible.</li>
				<li>Clarify feelings.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h5>Step Three: Agree the Problem</h5>
			
			<p>This sounds like an obvious step, but often different underlying needs, interests and goals can cause people to perceive problems very differently. You'll need to agree the problems that you are trying to solve before you'll find a mutually acceptable solution.</p>
			
			<p>Sometimes different people will see different but interlocking problems &#8211; if you can&#39;t reach a common perception of the problem, then at the very least, you need to understand what the other person sees as the problem.</p>
			
			<h5>Step Four: Brainstorm Possible Solutions</h5>
			
			<p>If everyone is going to feel satisfied with the resolution, it will help if everyone has had fair input in generating solutions. Brainstorm possible solutions, and be open to all ideas, including ones you never considered before.</p>
			
			<h5>Step Five: Negotiate a Solution</h5>
			
			<p>By this stage, the conflict may be resolved: Both sides may better understand the position of the other, and a mutually satisfactory solution may be clear to all.</p>
			
			<p>However you may also have uncovered real differences between your positions. This is where a technique like win-win negotiation can be useful to find a solution that, at least to some extent, satisfies everyone.</p>
			
			<p>There are three guiding principles here: Be Calm, Be Patient, Have Respect&#8230;</p>
			
			<h4>Key Points</h4>
			
			<p>Conflict in the workplace can be incredibly destructive to good teamwork. Managed in the wrong way, real and legitimate differences between people can quickly spiral out of control, resulting in situations where co-operation breaks down and the team's mission is threatened. This is particularly the case where the wrong approaches to conflict resolution are used.</p>
			
			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">60</span></div>
			
			<p>To calm these situations down, it helps to take a positive approach to conflict resolution, where discussion is courteous and non&#45;confrontational, and the focus is on issues rather than on individuals. If this is done, then, as long as people listen carefully and explore facts, issues and possible solutions properly, conflict can often be resolved effectively.</p>
