			<h2>Introduction to Communication Skills</h2>
			<div class="header-caption">Why you need to get your message across</div>

			<p class="skimmable">Effective communication is all about conveying your messages to other people clearly and unambiguously. It&#39;s also about receiving information that others are sending to you, with as little distortion as possible.</p>

			<p>Doing this involves effort from both the sender of the message and the receiver. And it&#39;s a process that can be fraught with error, with messages muddled by the sender, or misinterpreted by the recipient. When this isn&#39;t detected, it can cause tremendous confusion, wasted effort and missed opportunity.</p>

			<p>In fact, communication is only successful when both the sender and the receiver understand the same information as a result of the communication.</p>

			<p>By successfully getting your message across, you convey your thoughts and ideas effectively. When not successful, the thoughts and ideas that you actually send do not necessarily reflect what you think, causing a communications breakdown and creating roadblocks that stand in the way of your goals - both personally and professionally.</p>

			<p>In a recent survey of recruiters from companies with more than 50,000 employees, communication skills were cited as the single more important decisive factor in choosing managers. The survey, conducted by the University of Pittsburgh&#39;s Katz Business School, points out that communication skills, including written and oral presentations, as well as an ability to work with others, are the main factor contributing to job success.</p>

			<p>In spite of the increasing importance placed on communication skills, many individuals continue to struggle, unable to communicate their thoughts and ideas effectively - whether in verbal or written format. This inability makes it nearly impossible for them to compete effectively in the workplace, and stands in the way of career progression.</p>

			<p>Being able to communicate effectively is therefore essential if you want to build a successful career. To do this, you must understand what your message is, what audience you are sending it to, and how it will be perceived. You must also weigh-in the circumstances surrounding your communications, such as situational and cultural context.</p>

			<h4>Communications Skills - The Importance of Removing Barriers</h4>

			<p>Problems with communication can pop-up at every stage of the communication process &#40;which consists of the <strong>sender</strong>, <strong>encoding</strong>, the <strong>channel</strong>, <strong>decoding</strong>, the <strong>receiver</strong>, <strong>feedback</strong> and the <strong>context</strong> - see the diagram below&#41;. At each stage, there is the potential for misunderstanding and confusion.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure1section9.0.png">
			</figure>

			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">111</span></div>

			<p>To be an effective communicator and to get your point across without misunderstanding and confusion, your goal should be to lessen the frequency of problems at each stage of this process, with clear, concise, accurate, well-planned communications. We follow the process through below:</p>

			<h4>Source...</h4>

			<p>As the source of the message, you need to be clear about why you&#39;re communicating, and what you want to communicate. You also need to be confident that the information you&#39;re communicating is useful and accurate.</p>

			<h4>Message...</h4>

			<p>The message is the information that you want to communicate.</p>

			<h4>Encoding...</h4>

			<p>This is the process of transferring the information you want to communicate into a form that can be sent and correctly decoded at the other end. Your success in encoding depends partly on your ability to convey information clearly and simply, but also on your ability to anticipate and eliminate sources of confusion &#40;for example, cultural issues, mistaken assumptions, and missing information.&#41;</p>

			<p>A key part of this is knowing your audience: Failure to understand who you are communicating with will result in delivering messages that are misunderstood.</p>

			<h4>Channel...</h4>

			<p>Messages are conveyed through channels, with verbal channels including face-to-face meetings, telephone and videoconferencing; and written channels including letters, emails, memos and reports.</p>

			<p>Different channels have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, it&#39;s not particularly effective to give a long list of directions verbally, while you&#39;ll quickly cause problems if you give someone negative feedback using email.</p>

			<h4>Decoding...</h4>

			<p>Just as successful encoding is a skill, so is successful decoding &#40;involving, for example, taking the time to read a message carefully, or listen actively to it.&#41; Just as confusion can arise from errors in encoding, it can also arise from decoding errors. This is particularly the case if the decoder doesn&#39;t have enough knowledge to understand the message.</p>

			<h4>Receiver...</h4>

			<p>Your message is delivered to individual members of your audience. No doubt, you have in mind the actions or reactions you hope your message will get from this audience. Keep in mind, though, that each of these individuals enters into the communication process with ideas and feelings that will undoubtedly influence their understanding of your message, and their response. To be a successful communicator, you should consider these before delivering your message, and act appropriately.</p>

			<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">112</span></div>

			<h4>Feedback...</h4>

			<p>Your audience will provide you with feedback, as verbal and nonverbal reactions to your communicated message. Pay close attention to this feedback, as it is the only thing that can give you confidence that your audience has understood your message. If you find that there has been a misunderstanding, at least you have the opportunity to send the message a second time.</p>

			<h4>Context...</h4>

			<p>The situation in which your message is delivered is the context. This may include the surrounding environment or broader culture &#40;corporate culture, international cultures, and so on&#41;.</p>

			<h4>Removing Barriers at All These Stages</h4>

			<p>To deliver your messages effectively, you must commit to breaking down the barriers that exist within each of these stages of the communication process.</p>

			<p>Let&#39;s begin with the message itself. If your message is too lengthy, disorganized, or contains errors, you can expect the message to be misunderstood and misinterpreted. Use of poor verbal and body language can also confuse the message.</p>

			<p>Barriers in context tend to stem from senders offering too much information too fast. When in doubt here, less is oftentimes more. It is best to be mindful of the demands on other people&#39;s time, especially in today&#39;s ultra-busy society.</p>

			<p>Once you understand this, you need to work to understand your audience&#39;s culture, making sure you can converse and deliver your message to people of different backgrounds and cultures within your own organization, in your country and even abroad.</p>

				<h3>Making a Great First Impression!</h3>

				<p class="skimmable">It takes just a quick glance, maybe three seconds, for someone to evaluate you when you meet for the first time. In this short time, the other person forms an opinion about you based on your appearance, your body language, your demeanor, your mannerisms, and how you are dressed.</p>

				<p>With every new encounter, you are evaluated and yet another person&#39;s impression of you is formed. These first impression can be nearly impossible to reverse or undo, making those first encounters extremely important, for they set the tone for the all the relationships that follows.</p>

				<p>So, whether they are in your career or social life, it&#39;s important to know how to create a good first impression. This article provides some useful tips to help you do this.</p>

				<h4>Be on Time</h4>

				<p>The person you are meeting for the first time is not interested in your &lsquo;good excuse&rsquo; for running late. Plan to arrive a few minutes early. And allow flexibility for possible delays in traffic or taking a wrong turn. Arriving early is much better that arriving late, hands down, and is the first step in creating a great first impression.</p>

				<h4>Be Yourself, Be at Ease</h4>

				<p>If you are feeling uncomfortable and on edge, this can make the other person ill at ease and that&#39;s a sure way to create the wrong impression. If you are calm and confident, so the other person will</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">113</span></div>

				<p>feel more at ease, and so have a solid foundation for making that first impression a good one. See our section on relaxation techniques to find out how to calm that adrenaline!</p>

				<h4>Present Yourself Appropriately</h4>

				<p>Of course physical appearance matters. The person you are meeting for the first time does not know you and your appearance is usually the first clue he or she has to go on.</p>

				<p>But it certainly does not mean you need to look like a model to create a strong and positive first impression. &#40;Unless you are interviewing with your local model agency, of course!&#41;</p>

				<p>No. The key to a good impression is to present yourself appropriately.</p>

				<p>They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and so the &lsquo;picture&rsquo; you first present says much about you to the person you are meeting. Is your appearance saying the right things to help create the right first impression?</p>

				<p>Start with the way you dress. What is the appropriate dress for the meeting or occasion? In a business setting, what is the appropriate business attire? Suit, blazer, casual? And ask yourself what the person you&#39;ll be meeting is likely to wear - if your contact is in advertising or the music industry, a pinstripe business suit may not strike the right note!</p>

				<p>For business and social meetings, appropriate dress also varies between countries and cultures, so it&#39;s something that you should pay particular attention to when in an unfamiliar setting or country. Make sure you know the traditions and norms.</p>

				<p>And what about your personal grooming? Clean and tidy appearance is appropriate for most business and social occasions. A good haircut or shave. Clean and tidy clothes. Neat and tidy make up. Make sure your grooming is appropriate and helps make you feel &lsquo;the part&rsquo;.</p>

				<p>Appropriate dressing and grooming help make a good first impression and also help you feel &lsquo;the part&rsquo;, and so feel more calm and confident. Add all of this up and you are well on your way to creating a good first impression.</p>

				<h4>A Word about Individuality</h4>

				<p>The good news is you can usually create a good impression without total conformity or losing your individuality. Yes, to make a good first impression you do need to &lsquo;fit in&rsquo; to some degree. But it all goes back to being appropriate for the situation. If in a business setting, wear appropriate business attire. If at a formal evening social event, wear appropriate evening attire. And express your individuality appropriately within that context.</p>

				<h4>A Winning Smile!</h4>

				<p>&lsquo;Smile and the world smiles too.&rsquo;* So there&#39;s nothing like a smile to create a good first impression. A warm and confident smile will put both you and the other person at ease. So smiling is a winner when it comes to great first impressions. But don&#39;t go overboard with this - people who take this too far can seem insincere and smarmy, or can be seen to be &lsquo;lightweights&rsquo;.</p>

				<p><em>&#40;*Author Unknown&#41;</em></p>

				<h4>Be Open and Confident</h4>

				<p>When it comes to making the first impression, body language as well as appearance speaks much louder than words.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">114</span></div>

				<p>Use your body language to project appropriate confidence and self-assurance. Stand tall, smile &#40;of course&#41;, make eye contact, greet with a firm handshake. All of this will help you project confidence and encourage both you and the other person feel better at ease.</p>

				<p>Almost everyone gets a little nervous when meeting someone for the first time, which can lead to nervous habits or sweaty palms. By being aware of your nervous habits, you can try to keep them in check. And controlling a nervous jitter or a nervous laugh will give you confidence and help the other person feel at ease. Again, see our section on relaxation techniques for help with this.</p>

				<h4>Small Talk Goes a Long Way...</h4>

				<p>Conversations are based on verbal give and take. It may help you to prepare questions you have for the person you are meeting for the first time beforehand. Or, take a few minutes to learn something about the person you meet for the first time before you get together. For instance, does he play golf? Does she work with a local charitable foundation?</p>

				<p>Is there anything that you know of that you have in common with the person you are meeting? If so, this can be a great way to open the conversation and to keep it flowing.</p>

				<h4>Be Positive</h4>

				<p>Your attitude shows through in everything you do. Project a positive attitude, even in the face of criticism or in the case of nervousness. Strive to learn from your meeting and to contribute appropriately, maintaining an upbeat manner and a smile.</p>

				<h4>Be Courteous and Attentive</h4>

				<p>It goes without saying that good manners and polite, attentive and courteous behavior help make a good first impression. In fact, anything less can ruin the one chance you have at making that first impression. So be on your best behavior!</p>

				<p>One modern manner worth mentioning is &lsquo;turn off your mobile phone&rsquo;. What first impression will you create if you are already speaking to someone other than the person you are meeting for the first time? Your new acquaintance deserves 100% of your attention. Anything less and you&#39;ll create a less than good first impression.</p>

				<h4>Key Points</h4>

				<p>You have just a few seconds to make a good first impression and it&#39;s almost impossible ever to change it. So it&#39;s worth giving each new encounter your best shot. Much of what you need to do to make a good impression is common sense. But with a little extra thought and preparation, you can hone your intuitive style and make every first impression not just good but great.</p>

			<section class="subsection" data-number="3" data-name="The Johari Window">
				<h3>The Johari Window</h3>
				<div class="header-caption">Creating better understanding between individuals and groups</div>

				<p class="skimmable">The Johari Window is a communication model that can be used to improve understanding between individuals within a team or in a group setting. Based on disclosure, self-disclosure and feedback, the Johari Window can also be used to improve a group&#39;s relationship with other groups</p>

				<p>Developed by <strong>Jo</strong>seph Luft and <strong>Har</strong>ry <strong>I</strong>ngham &#40;the word &lsquo;Johari&rsquo; comes from Joseph Luft and Harry Ingham&#41;, there are two key ideas behind the tool:</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">115</span></div>

				<ol>
					<li>That individuals can build trust between themselves by disclosing information about themselves; and</li>
					<li>That they can learn about themselves and come to terms with personal issues with the help of feedback from others.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>By explaining the idea of the Johari Window to your team, you can help team members understand the value of self-disclosure, and gently encourage people to give and accept feedback. Done sensitively, this can help people build more-trusting relationships with one another, solve issues and work more effectively as a team.</p>

				<h4>Explaining the Johari Window:</h4>

				<p>The Johari Window model consists of a foursquare grid &#40;think of taking a piece of paper and dividing it into four parts by drawing one line down the middle of the paper from top to bottom, and another line through the middle of the paper from side-to-side&#41;. This is shown in the diagram below:</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure1section9.2.png">
				</figure>

				<p>Using the Johari model, each person is represented by their own four-quadrant, or four-pane, window. Each of these contains and represents personal information - feelings, motivation - about the person, and shows whether the information is known or not known by themselves or other people.</p>

				<p>The four quadrants are:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Quadrant 1: Open Area</strong><br/>
					What is known by the person about him/herself and is also known by others.</li>
					<li><strong>Quadrant 2: Blind Area, or &lsquo;Blind Spot&rsquo;</strong><br/>
					What is unknown by the person about him/herself but which others know. This can be simple information, or can involve deep issues &#40;for example, feelings of inadequacy, incompetence, unworthiness, rejection&#41; which are difficult for individuals to face directly, and yet can be seen by others.</li>
					<li><strong>Quadrant 3: Hidden or Avoided Area</strong><br/>
					What the person knows about him/herself that others do not.</li>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">116</span></div>

					<li><strong>Quadrant 4: Unknown Area</strong><br/>
					What is unknown by the person about him/herself and is also unknown by others.</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Tip 1:</strong>
					<p>Don&#39;t be rash in your self-disclosure. Disclosing harmless items builds trust. However, disclosing information which could damage people&#39;s respect for you can put you in a position of weakness.</p>
				</div>

				<h4>Using the Tool:</h4>

				<p>The process of enlarging the open quadrant horizontally is one of feedback. Here the individual learns things about him- or her-self that others can see, but he or she can&#39;t.</p>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Tip 2:</strong>
					<p>Be careful in the way you give feedback. Some cultures have a very open and accepting approach to feedback. Others don&#39;t. You can cause incredible offence if you offer personal feedback to someone who&#39;s not used to it. Be sensitive, and start gradually.</p>
				</div>

				<p>If anyone is interested in learning more about this individual, they reciprocate by disclosing information in their hidden quadrant.</p>

				<p>For example, the first participant may disclose that he/she is a runner. The other participant may respond by adding that he/she works out regularly at the local gym, and may then disclose that the gym has recently added an indoor jogging track for winter runners.</p>

				<p>As your levels of confidence and self-esteem rises, it is easier to invite others to comment on your blind spots. Obviously, active and empathic listening skills are useful in this exercise.</p>

				<h4>The Johari Window in a Team Context</h4>

				<p>Keep in mind that established team members will have larger open areas than new team members. New team members start with smaller open areas because little knowledge about the new team member has yet been shared. The size of the Open Area can be expanded horizontally into the blind space, by seeking and actively listening to feedback from other group members.</p>

				<p>Group members should strive to assist a team member in expanding their Open Area by offering constructive feedback. The size of the Open Area can also be expanded vertically downwards into the hidden or avoided space by the sender&#39;s disclosure of information, feelings, etc about himself/herself to the group and group members.</p>

				<p>Also, group members can help a person expand their Open Area into the hidden area by asking the sender about himself/herself. Managers and team leaders play a key role here, facilitating feedback and disclosure among group members, and by providing constructive feedback to individuals about their own blind areas.</p>

				<h4>Key Points</h4>

				<p>In most cases, the aim in groups should be to develop the Open Area for every person.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">117</span></div>

				<p>Working in this area with others usually allows for enhanced individual and team effectiveness and productivity. The Open Area is the &lsquo;space&rsquo; where good communications and cooperation occur, free from confusion, conflict and misunderstanding.</p>

				<p>Self-disclosure is the process by which people expand the Open Area vertically. Feedback is the process by which people expand this area horizontally.</p>

				<p>By encouraging healthy self-disclosure and sensitive feedback, you can build a stronger and more effective team.</p>

			<section class="subsection" data-number="4" data-name="Business Story-Telling">
				<h3>Business Story-Telling</h3>
				<div class="header-caption">Using stories to inspire</div>

				<p class="skimmable">Think about this for a minute, because it may happen more often than you think. How many times have you stayed up late reading a novel that you &lsquo;couldn&#39;t&rsquo; put down, or watching a movie that you couldn&#39;t turn off? How many times have you pushed yourself harder after hearing the story of someone else&#39;s success, or changed your opinion after reading a convincing article in a magazine or newspaper?</p>

				<p>There&#39;s no doubt that stories can change the way we think, act, and feel. Leaders, especially, can use the power of a good story to influence and motivate their teams to new heights. Stories can inspire everything from understanding to action. They can create legends that an entire workplace culture can build upon, and they have the power to break down barriers and turn a bad situation into a good one. Stories can capture our imaginations and make things real in a way that cold, hard facts can&#39;t.</p>

				<p>Make no mistake - stories can be very, very powerful leadership tools. Great leaders know this, and many top CEOs today use stories to illustrate points and sell their ideas.</p>

				<p>So, do you want to be a persuasive motivator? If so, learn how to tell a good story. But how? When should you tell a story, and how do you know what kind of story to tell to get the results you want? This article summarizes our Expert Interview with Annette Simmons, author of &lsquo;Whoever Tells the Best Story Wins.&rsquo;</p>

				<h4>Types of Stories</h4>

				<p>Learn what kind of story to tell for different situations. There are six main types of story that you can use in the workplace:</p>

				<p><strong>1. &lsquo;Who I Am&rsquo; Stories</strong> - When you start leading a team, members of your new team sometimes make automatic judgments about who you are. They may see you as controlling, mean, or &lsquo;out to get them&rsquo; without really knowing you. If you tell a &lsquo;Who I Am&rsquo; story when you first become a team leader, you can give a powerful insight into what really motivates you. This can break down walls and help your team realize that you&#39;re a person just like them.</p>

				<p>Your goal with a &lsquo;Who I Am&rsquo; story should be to reveal some type of flaw about yourself or mistake that you&#39;ve made. Why? Because by revealing a flaw, you show your team that you trust them with this information. Revealing flaws can also make you more approachable, because it demonstrates that you&#39;re only human. &#40;Just make sure it&#39;s a small flaw!&#41;</p>

				<p>For example, the author often finds that when clients first meet her, they assume that her primary goal is to sell them copies of her book or more consulting time. She gets past this by explaining that her dad was a social worker who wanted her to help others &#40;while also being her own boss&#41; and so felt she should go to law school. She was so determined not to do this, that she moved to</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">118</span></div>

				<p>Australia. This story has the double benefit of emphasizing that she didn&#39;t grow up in privileged circumstances, and so actually has a background similar to that of many of her clients, and also that she might sometimes make slightly foolish decisions. After all, emigrating to another continent is a rather extreme way of getting out of going to law school!</p>

				<p><strong>2. &lsquo;Why I&#39;m Here&rsquo; Stories</strong> - These are very similar to &lsquo;Who I Am&rsquo; stories. The goal is to replace suspicion with trust, and help your team realize that you don&#39;t have any hidden agendas. Show that you&#39;re a good person, and that you want to work together with them to achieve a common goal.</p>

				<p>For example, a new member of the school board was appointed to the sub-committee responsible for the head teacher&#39;s performance management. In their first meeting, which looked at whether the head had met her stated objectives in the past year, the new member challenged the Head on several aspects of the proof presented. After the meeting, the new board member approached the Head, and explained &lsquo;I&#39;m sure you realize that my challenges are not personal. And I think you&#39;re doing great work. However, my duty as a board member is to ensure that the city&#39;s education budget is being spent wisely, and so it&#39;s my job to ensure that bonuses are only paid when there&#39;s a real justification for doing so.&rsquo; The Head reassured her that she understood this perfectly, and was, in fact, grateful for the rigor she had brought to the process.</p>

				<p><strong>3. Teaching Stories</strong> - It can be very hard to teach without demonstrating, and that&#39;s the whole purpose of Teaching Stories.</p>

				<p>There&#39;s no better example of this than Aesop&#39;s fables. Remember &lsquo;The Boy Who Cried Wolf&rsquo;? This story alone has taught millions of children not to yell for help unless there&#39;s a real need for it. Although it&#39;s simple, like most fables, it&#39;s done an effective job for centuries.</p>

				<p>Use Teaching Stories to make a lesson clear and to help people remember why they&#39;re doing something in the first place.</p>

				<p>The author tells a more recent example to emphasize the value of teaching stories. She was working with a nation wide chain of care homes for the elderly. Many of the staff in these homes are young and, with the best intentions, often use tones of voice that are more suitable for addressing young children than elderly people. The challenge was to get these young staff to remember to use respectful tones of voice. She achieved this by telling the story of her own grandmother, who suffered a stroke and was unable to speak. After some months, she gave up eating because she had decided she would rather die than live without dignity, because of the patronizing way in which her carers spoke to her.</p>

				<p><strong>4. Vision Stories</strong> - Tell these to inspire hope, especially when your team needs occasional reminders of why they&#39;re doing what they should be doing.</p>

				<p>Vision Stories are meant to stimulate action and raise morale. Find a story that reminds everyone what the ultimate goal is, and why it&#39;s important that everyone reaches that goal. This type of story should be told from your heart, with emotion.</p>

				<p>The author shares her own vision story, which is one of human beings saving the planet from ecological disaster by working together. She drew on the importance of embedding this collaborative approach in society when she was at the airport recently, and her plane was delayed for the third time. While it would have been tempting to take out her frustration on the airline staff, remembering the importance of helping others to work collaboratively helped her calm her emotions.</p>

				<p><strong>5. &lsquo;Values in Action&rsquo; Stories</strong> - When you see the word &lsquo;integrity,&rsquo; what do you think of? Honesty? Doing the right thing for the right reason?</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">119</span></div>

				<p>Every value can mean something different from person to person. If you want to pass on values to your team, start by defining what those values mean to you. So, if you want your team to demonstrate a high level of customer service, then tell a story that reveals exactly what customer service means to you.</p>

				<p>For example, a chain of opticians ran an advertising campaign that offered to replace glasses with a new style if customers didn&#39;t like the frames when they got them home. Now this led to the transaction costing the optician money in most cases. However, the manager at one store regularly told his staff about a customer who had taken advantage - most apologetically - of the offer, but then not only remained loyal to that optical chain for years, but also recommended the chain to her family and friends. As a result, the small loss on one transaction bought the chain many profitable purchases in the future.</p>

				<p><strong>6. &lsquo;I Know What You&#39;re Thinking&rsquo; Stories</strong> - The world of business involves frequent bargaining. The advantage of telling this type of story is that you can recognize another person&#39;s objections, and then show why those objections aren&#39;t applicable in this situation. You can show respect for the other point of view while convincing the person that you&#39;re right.</p>

				<p>For example, a saleswoman in children&#39;s shoe store convinces a mom to buy a pair of premium-priced shoes by explaining that if her child doesn&#39;t find his new shoes comfortable after a week, she can bring them back for an exchange or refund. This is the case even though the shoes would be worn and couldn&#39;t be resold. The saleswoman backs this up by telling of one customer who did that just last week, although she was the only customer whose child hadn&#39;t loved the shoes.</p>

				<h4>Tips</h4>

				<p>Keep these suggestions in mind when telling your stories:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Be authentic</strong> - The best storytellers talk from their hearts, so don&#39;t try to fake an emotion that you don&#39;t feel. Your listeners will probably see through this, and your story will crash and burn.</li>
					<li><strong>Pay attention to your audience</strong> - Stories that are too long are generally boring. Tell the story well, but don&#39;t go on forever.</li>
					<li><strong>Practice</strong> - Try to practice before you tell the story. Even if you tell it to yourself just once in front of a mirror or video camera, this can help you when you&#39;re in front of your real audience.</li>
					<li><strong>Create an experience</strong> - Remember that when you tell a story, you&#39;re creating an experience for your listeners. Don&#39;t just use sound &#40;words&#41;, but the other senses as well. <strong>Show</strong> your listeners the picture you&#39;re painting, don&#39;t just tell them.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>For example, it&#39;s easy to tell people that it&#39;s snowing outside. But if you want your listeners to really experience the snow, then describe how cold it is and the way the wind blows snow into your eyes. Tell them how you dream of a hot cup of cocoa after you&#39;re done shoveling snow in your driveway, and how your toes freeze because your boots aren&#39;t warm enough. Try to engage the five senses in every story: taste, touch, sight, hearing, and smell. They&#39;ll make your story come alive.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>

				<h4>Key Points</h4>

				<p>Stories can be powerful leadership tools - if they&#39;re told well.</p>

				<p>Know which kind of story to tell, and spend time brainstorming some good ideas for each type of situation. Remember, you&#39;re creating an experience for your listeners, so focus on using at least</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">120</span></div>

				<p>two or three senses when you tell your story. Create interest, and draw your listeners in. Show them what you&#39;re saying, don&#39;t just tell them.</p>

				<h3>Better Public Speaking and Presentation</h3>
				<div class="header-caption">Ensure your words are always understood</div>

				<p class="skimmable">Think of the last really memorable talk or presentation that you attended. Now, was that easy to do, or did you really have to rack your brains to remember one? Sadly, too many presentations are easy to forget. And that&#39;s a big problem because the only reason the presenter gave the talk was to communicate something to you!</p>

				<p>However, there are three basic things that you can do to ensure that your verbal messages are understood - and remembered - time and time again.</p>

				<p>Although somewhat obvious and deceptively simple, these are:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Understand the purpose of the presentation</li>
					<li>Keep the message clear and concise</li>
					<li>Be prepared</li>
					<li>Be vivid when delivering the message</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Understand What You Want to Achieve</h4>

				<p>Before you start working on your talk or presentation, it&#39;s vital that you really understand what you want to say, who you want to tell and why they might want to hear it. To do this, ask yourself: <strong>Who? What? How? When? Where? Why?</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Who</strong> are you speaking to? What are their interests, presuppositions and values? What do they share in common with others; how are they unique?</p>

				<p><strong>What</strong> do you wish to communicate? One way of answering this question is to ask yourself about the &lsquo;success criteria&rsquo;. How do you know if and when you have successfully communicated what you have in mind?</p>

				<p><strong>How</strong> can you best convey your message? Language is important here, as are the nonverbal cues discussed earlier. Choose your words and your nonverbal cues with your audience in mind. Plan a beginning, middle and end. If time and place allow, consider and prepare audio-visual aids.</p>

				<p><strong>When?</strong> Timing is important here. Develop a sense of timing, so that your contributions are seen and heard as relevant to the issue or matter at hand. There is a time to speak and a time to be silent. &lsquo;It&#39;s better to be silent than sing a bad tune.&rsquo;</p>

				<p><strong>Where?</strong> What is the physical context of the communication in mind? You may have time to visit the room, for example, and rearrange the furniture. Check for availability and visibility if you are using audio or visual aids.</p>

				<p><strong>Why?</strong> In order to convert hearers into listeners, you need to know why they should listen to you - and tell them if necessary. What disposes them to listen? That implies that you know yourself why you are seeking to communicate - the value or worth or interest of what you are going to say.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">221</span></div>

				<h4>Keep It Simple</h4>

				<p>When it comes to wording your message, less is more. You&#39;re giving your audience headlines. They don&#39;t need to and are usually not expecting to become experts on the subject as a result of hearing your talk.</p>

				<p>If you&#39;re using slides, limit the content of each one to a few bullet points, or one statement or a very simple diagram</p>

				<h4>Be Prepared</h4>

				<p>Preparation is underrated. In fact, it is one of the most important factors in determining your communication successes. When possible, set meeting times and speaking and presentation times well in advance, thus allowing yourself the time you need to prepare your communications, mindful of the entire communication process &#40;source, encoding, channel, decoding, receiver, feedback and context&#41;. By paying close attention to each of these stages and preparing accordingly, you ensure your communications will be more effective and better understood.</p>

				<p>Of course, not all communications can be scheduled. In this case, preparation may mean having a good, thorough understanding of the office goings-on, enabling you to communicate with the knowledge you need to be effective, both through verbal and written communications.</p>

				<h4>Unforgettable Delivery</h4>

				<p>Your delivery of your speech or presentation will make or break it, no matter how well you&#39;ve prepared and crafted your clear, concise message. Some useful tips for keeping your presentation vivid include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Use examples to bring your points to life</li>
					<li>Keep your body language up-beat - don&#39;t stay stuck behind a rostrum</li>
					<li>Don&#39;t talk to fast. Less is more here too. Pauses are effective.</li>
					<li>Use a variety of tones of voice</li>
					<li>Use visual aids.</li>
				</ul>

			<section class="subsection" data-number="6" data-name="Speaking to an Audience">
				<h3>Speaking to an Audience</h3>
				<div class="header-caption">Communicate complex ideas successfully</div>

				<p class="skimmable">Speaking to an audience can be fun and exciting. However, lack of preparation or not clearly defining the presentation&#39;s goals and its audience can make even the best-intended presentation a complete disaster.</p>

				<h4>Preparation - The Key to Successful Speaking...</h4>

				<p>To ensure your presentation is effective, first determine your objective. Ask yourself:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Why am I giving the presentation?</li>
					<li>What do I want the audience to take away from the presentation?</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Second, determine your audience. Their familiarity with the presentation topic will determine the level at which you present your speech.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">122</span></div>

				<h4>How to Structure Your Presentation</h4>

				<p>Once you have determined your presentation&#39;s objective and overall goal, as well as the audience, it&#39;s time to structure your presentation. You will need to start this process by determining the length of the presentation.</p>

				<p>Take the allotted time and break it into smaller segments, with each segment tackling a specific task &#40;all of which reflect the overall objective of the presentation&#41;. For example, the fist segment should be the presentation introduction. In this segment, you should give an overview of your presentation, or a short summary of your speech, explaining the topic, why you are covering this topic, and what you hope to accomplish.</p>

				<p>The next segment should tackle the first item on your agenda, with the following segment tackling the following item on your agenda, and so on.</p>

				<p>Once you have developed the introduction and outlined the following segments, spend some time thinking about the conclusion of the presentation. The introduction of the presentation and the conclusion of the presentation are the most important parts and should have the strongest impact.</p>

				<h4>Achieving Clarity and Impact</h4>

				<p>Keep your presentation short and simple. Your audience will not remember every point of your presentation, so highlight the most important parts. The longer the presentation, the higher the risk of boredom.</p>

				<p>When in doubt, use the &lsquo;tell &#39;em&rsquo; structure:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Tell them what you are going to tell them &#40;For instance, &lsquo;In this presentation I will show you...&rsquo;&#41;.</li>
					<li>Tell them the key points, expanding and illustrating each one, clearly and concisely.</li>
					<li>Tell them what you have told them &#40;For instance, &lsquo;In closing...&rsquo; or &lsquo;In summary...&rsquo;&#41; and conclude.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Reinforce Your Message with Visual Aids</h4>

				<p>Next, consider the use of visual aids. Slide projectors, data projectors, video machines and computers should be tested out beforehand to make sure they are operating correctly and that you know how to use them.</p>

				<p>Make sure you do not cram too much information onto any single visual. A good rule of thumb to follow is to keep each visual to six lines or less. Also, make sure any type or graphics are large enough the audience can see it clearly &#40;from all seats&#41; and make sure the colors used are easy on the eyes, taking into account the lighting.</p>

				<p>A sad fact is that much of your authority will be judged by the quality of your slides - you need to make sure that their design supports the style of your message.</p>

				<p>Overheads should be clearly marked and arranged in order beforehand. Flip charts should be prepared in advance when possible. When used during the presentation to take notes, make print large enough for all participants to see.</p>

				<p>When using these various visuals, do not turn your back to the audience. Position yourself so you can use the visuals while facing your audience.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">123</span></div>

				<h4>Arranging the Room</h4>

				<p>If possible, visit the room in which you will make the presentation well in advance. Determine seating &#40;circle seating encourages interaction, rows of seats discourages interaction, etc.&#41; and determine how the visual aids you choose will work. Consider lighting, space, even the temperature of the room. Consider placing notepads and pencils at each seat if participants need to take notes. Or, you may want to have glasses at each seat with a few pitchers of water if the presentation is going to last more than half of an hour. If you do this, make sure you allow time for bathroom breaks.</p>

				<p>While you do not need to memorize your entire presentation, make yourself very, very familiar with it through several practice runs. Rehearse the presentation in its entirety as often as you can before delivering it to a live audience. The more you rehearse, the more confident you will be and the more fluent you will seem to your audience - if you know your subject matter and have adequately prepared, you will be able to deliver your message loud and clear.</p>

				<p>When in doubt or nervous, stay focused on your purpose - helping your audience understand your message. Direct your thoughts to the subject at hand. The audience has come to hear your presentation and you will succeed!</p>

				<h4>Tips and Techniques</h4>

				<p>Tips to help make your presentation a smashing success:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Avoid too many statistics and confusing information in your presentation. Instead, put this information in a handout for participants to refer to at a later date.</li>
					<li>If you forget your words, pause for a moment and remember your objective. While the words may not come right back to you, this will help keep you on track and may even help you to think of additional thoughts and ideas your audience will benefit from hearing.</li>
					<li>Visualize yourself succeeding.</li>
					<li>Begin by breathing.</li>
					<li>Before the presentation, focus on the needs of the audience.</li>
					<li>Take a public speaking course at a local college or university. These are oftentimes offered as night courses and are usually very inexpensive, while providing you with important skills that will enhance your confidence in this area.</li>
					<li>Videotape yourself going through the presentation. All you need to do this is a video camera and a tripod. Then, run through the video and make changes according to your thoughts on the taped presentation.</li>
				</ul>

			<section class="subsection" data-number="8" data-name="Questioning Techniques">
				<h3>Questioning Techniques</h3>
				<div class="header-caption">Asking questions effectively</div>

				<p class="skimmable">Garbage in, garbage out, is a popular truth, often said in relation to computer systems: If you put the wrong information in, you&#39;ll get the wrong information out. The same principle applies to communications in general: If you ask the wrong questions, you&#39;ll probably get the wrong answer, or at least not quite what you&#39;re hoping for.</p>

				<p>Asking the right question is at the heart of effective communications and information exchange. By using the right questions in a particular situation, you can improve a whole range of communications skills: for example, you can gather better information and learn more; you can build stronger relationships, manage people more effectively and help others to learn too.</p>

				<p>So here are some common questioning techniques, and when &#40;and when not&#41; to use them:</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">125</span></div>

				<h4>Open and Closed Questions</h4>

				<p>A closed question usually receives a single word or very short, factual answer. For example, &lsquo;Are you thirsty?&rsquo; The answer is &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;No&rsquo;; &lsquo;Where do you live?&rsquo; The answer is generally the name of your town or your address.</p>

				<p>Open questions elicit longer answers. They usually begin with what, why, how. An open question asks the respondent for his or her knowledge, opinion or feelings. &lsquo;Tell me&rsquo; and &lsquo;describe&rsquo; can also be used in the same way as open questions. Here are some examples:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>What happened at the meeting?</li>
					<li>Why did he react that way?</li>
					<li>How was the party?</li>
					<li>Tell me what happened next.</li>
					<li>Describe the circumstances in more detail.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Open questions are good for:</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Developing an open conversation: &lsquo;What did you get up to on vacation?&rsquo;</li>
					<li>Finding our more detail: &lsquo;What else do we need to do to make this a success?&rsquo;</li>
					<li>Finding out the other person&#39;s opinion or issues: &lsquo;What do you think about those changes?&rsquo;</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Closed questions are good for:</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Testing your understanding, or the other person&#39;s: &lsquo;So, if I get this qualification, I will get a rise?&rsquo;</li>
					<li>Concluding a discussion or making a decision: &lsquo;Now we know the facts, are we all agreed this is the right course of action?&rsquo;</li>
					<li>Frame setting: &lsquo;Are you happy with the service from your bank?&rsquo;</li>
				</ul>

				<p>A misplaced closed question, on the other hand, can kill the conversation and lead to awkward silences, so are best avoided when a conversation is in full flow.</p>

				<h4>Funnel Questions</h4>

				<p>This technique involves starting with general questions, and then homing in on a point in each answer, and asking more and more detail at each level. It&#39;s often used by detectives taking a statement from a witness:</p>

				<ul class="noBullets">
					<li>&lsquo;How many people were involved in the fight?&rsquo;<br/>
						<em>&lsquo;About ten.&rsquo;</em></li>
						<br/>
					<li>&lsquo;Were they kids or adults?&rsquo;<br/>
						<em>&lsquo;Mostly kids.&rsquo;</em></li>
						<br/>
					<li>&lsquo;What sort of ages were they?&rsquo;<br/>
						<em>&lsquo;About fourteen or fifteen.&rsquo;</em></li>
						<br/>
					<li>&lsquo;Were any of them wearing anything distinctive?&rsquo;<br/>
						<em>&lsquo;Yes, several of them had red baseball caps on.&rsquo;</em></li>
						<br/>
					<li>&lsquo;Can you remember if there was a logo on any of the caps?&rsquo;<br/>
						<em>&lsquo;Now you come to mention it, yes, I remember seeing a big letter N.&rsquo;</em></li>
				</ul>

				<p>Using this technique, the detective has helped the witness re-live the scene and gradually focus on a useful detail. Perhaps he&#39;ll be able to identify young men wearing a hat like this from CCTV</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">126</span></div>

				<p>footage. It is unlikely he would have got this information if he&#39;s simply asked an open question such as &lsquo;Are there any details you can give me about what you saw?&rsquo;</p>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Tip:</strong>
					<p>When using funnel questioning, start with closed questions. As you progress through the tunnel, start using more open questions.</p>
				</div>

				<p><strong>Funnel questions are good for:</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Finding out more detail about a specific point: &lsquo;Tell me more about Option 2.&rsquo;</li>
					<li>Gaining the interest or increasing the confidence of the person you&#39;re speaking with: &lsquo;Have you used the IT Helpdesk?&rsquo;, &lsquo;Did they solve your problem?&rsquo;, &lsquo;What was the attitude of the person who took your call?&rsquo;</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Probing Questions</h4>

				<p>Asking probing questions is another strategy for finding out more detail. Sometimes it&#39;s as simple as asking your respondent for an example, to help you understand a statement they have made. At other times, you need additional information for clarification, &lsquo;When do you need this report by, and do you want to see a draft before I give you my final version?&rsquo;, or to investigate whether there is proof for what has been said, &lsquo;How do you know that the new database can&#39;t be used by the sales force?&rsquo;</p>

				<p>An effective way of probing is to use the 5 Whys method, which can help you quickly get to the root of a problem.</p>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Tip:</strong>
					<p>Use questions that include the word &lsquo;exactly&rsquo; to probe further: &lsquo;What exactly do you mean by fast-track?&rsquo;, &lsquo;Who, exactly, wanted this report?&rsquo;</p>
				</div>

				<p><strong>Probing questions are good for:</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Gaining clarification to ensure you have the whole story and that you understand it thoroughly.</li>
					<li>Drawing information out of people who are trying to avoid telling you something.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Leading Questions</h4>

				<p>Leading questions try to lead the respondent to your way of thinking. They can do this in several ways:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>With an assumption: &lsquo;How late do you think that the project will deliver?&rsquo;. This assumes that the project will certainly not be completed on time.</li>
					<li>By adding a personal appeal to agree at the end: &lsquo;Lori&#39;s very efficient, don&#39;t you think?&rsquo; or &lsquo;Option 2 is better, isn&#39;t it?&rsquo;</li>
					<li>Phrasing the question so that the &lsquo;easiest&rsquo; response is &lsquo;yes&rsquo; &#40;our natural tendency to prefer to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; than &lsquo;no&rsquo; plays an important part in the phrasing of referendum questions&#41;: &lsquo;Shall we all approve Option 2?&rsquo; is more likely to get a positive response than &lsquo;Do you want to approve option 2 or not?&rsquo;. A good way of doing this is to make it personal. For example, &lsquo;Would you like me to go ahead with Option 2?&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;Shall I choose Option 2?&rsquo;.</li>
					<li>Giving people a choice between two options, both of which you would be happy with, rather than the choice of one option or not doing anything at all. Strictly speaking, the choice of

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">127</span></div>
					
					&lsquo;neither&rsquo; is still available when you ask &lsquo;Which would you prefer of A or B&rsquo;, but most people will be caught up in deciding between your two preferences.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Note that leading questions tend to be closed.</p>

				<p><strong>Leading questions are good for:</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Getting the answer you want but leaving the other person feeling that they have had a choice.</li>
					<li>Closing a sale: &lsquo;If that answers all of your questions, shall we agree a price?&rsquo;</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Tip:</strong>
					<p>Use leading questions with care. If you use them in a self-serving way or one that harms the interests of the other person, then they can, quite rightly, be seen as manipulative and dishonest.</p>
				</div>

				<h4>Rhetorical Questions</h4>

				<p>Rhetorical questions aren&#39;t really questions at all, in that they don&#39;t expect an answer. They&#39;re really just statements phrased in question form: &lsquo;Isn&#39;t John&#39;s design work so creative?&rsquo;</p>

				<p>People use rhetorical questions because they are engaging for the listener - as they are drawn into agreeing &#40;&lsquo;Yes it is and I like working with such a creative colleague&rsquo;&#41; - rather than feeling that they are being &lsquo;told&rsquo; something like &lsquo;John is a very creative designer&rsquo;. &#40;To which they may answer</p>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Tip:</strong>
					<p>Rhetorical questions are even more powerful if you use a string of them. &lsuqo;Isn&#39;t that a great display? Don&#39;t you love the way the text picks up the colors in the photographs? Doesn&#39;t it use space really well? Wouldn&#39;t you love to have a display like that for our products?&rsquo;</p>
				</div>

				<p>&lsquo;So What?&rsquo;&#41;</p>

				<p><strong>Rhetorical questions are good for:</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Engaging the listener.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Using Questioning Techniques</h4>

				<p>You have probably used all of these questioning techniques before in your everyday life, at work and at home. But by consciously applying the appropriate kind of questioning, you can gain the information, response or outcome that you want even more effectively.</p>

				<p>Questions are a powerful way of:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Learning:</strong> Ask open and closed questions, and use probing questioning.</li>
					<li><strong>Relationship building:</strong> People generally respond positively if you ask about what they do or enquire about their opinions. If you do this in an affirmative way &lsquo;Tell me what you like best about working here&rsquo;, you will help to build and maintain an open dialogue.</li>
					<p><strong>Managing and coaching:</strong> Here, rhetorical and leading questions are useful too. They can help get people to reflect and to commit to courses of action that you&#39;ve suggested: &lsquo;Wouldn&#39;t it be great to gain some further qualifications?&rsquo;</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">128</span></div>

					<p><strong>Avoiding misunderstandings:</strong> Use probing questions to seek clarification, particularly when the consequences are significant. And to make sure you avoid jumping to conclusions, the Ladder of Inference tool can help too.</p>
					<li><strong>Diffusing a heated situation:</strong> You can calm an angry customer or colleague by using funnel questions to get them to go into more detail about their grievance. This will not only distract them from their emotions, but will often help you to identify a small practical thing that you can do, which is often enough to make them feel that they have &lsquo;won&rsquo; something, and no longer need to be angry.</li>
					<li><strong>Persuading people:</strong> No one likes to be lectured, but asking a series of open questions will help others to embrace the reasons behind your point of view. &lsquo;What do you think about bringing the sales force in for half a day to have their laptops upgraded?&rsquo;</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>More Tips:</strong>
					<p>Make sure that you give the person you&#39;re questioning enough time to respond. This may need to include thinking time before they answer, so don&#39;t just interpret a pause as a &lsquo;No comment&rsquo; and plow on.</p>
					<p>Skilful questioning needs to be matched by careful listening so that you understand what people really mean with their answers.</p>
					<p>Your body language and tone of voice can also play a part in the answers you get when you ask questions.</p>

				<h3>Active Listening</h3>
				<div class="header-caption">Hear what people are really saying</div>

				<p class="skimmable">Listening is one of the most important skills you can have. How well you listen has a major impact on your job effectiveness, and on the quality of your relationships with others.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>We listen to obtain information.</li>
					<li>We listen to understand.</li>
					<li>We listen for enjoyment.</li>
					<li>We listen to learn.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Given all this listening we do, you would think we&#39;d be good at it! In fact we&#39;re not. Depending on the study being quoted, we remember a dismal 25-50% of what we hear. That means that when you talk to your boss, colleagues, customers or spouse for 10 minutes, they only really hear 21&#47;2-5 minutes of the conversation.</p>

				<p>Turn it around and it reveals that when you are receiving directions or being presented with information, you aren&#39;t hearing the whole message either. You hope the important parts are captured in your 25-50%, but what if they&#39;re not?</p>

				<p>Clearly, listening is a skill that we can all benefit from improving. By becoming a better listener, you will improve your productivity, as well as your ability to influence, persuade negotiate. What&#39;s more, you&#39;ll avoid conflict and misunderstandings - all necessary for workplace success.</p>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<p>Good communication skills require a high level of self-awareness. By understanding your personal style of communicating, you will go a long way towards creating good and lasting impressions with others.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">129</span></div>

				<p>The way to become a better listener is to practice &lsquo;active listening&rsquo;. This is where you make a conscious effort to hear not only the words that another person is saying but, more importantly, to try and understand the total message being sent.</p>

				<p>In order to do this you must pay attention to the other person very carefully.</p>

				<p>You cannot allow yourself to become distracted by what else may be going on around you, or by forming counter arguments that you&#39;ll make when the other person stops speaking. Nor can you allow yourself to lose focus on what the other person is saying. All of these barriers contribute to a lack of listening and understanding.</p>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Tip:</strong>
					<p>If you&#39;re finding it particularly difficult to concentrate on what someone is saying, try repeating their words mentally as they say it - this will reinforce their message and help you control mind drift.</p>
				</div>

				<p>To enhance your listening skills, you need to let the other person know that you are listening to what he or she is saying. To understand the importance of this, ask yourself if you&#39;ve ever been engaged in a conversation when you wondered if the other person was listening to what you were saying. You wonder if your message is getting across, or if it&#39;s even worthwhile to continue speaking. It feels like talking to a brick wall and it&#39;s something you want to avoid.</p>

				<p>Acknowledgement can be something as simple as a nod of the head or a simple &lsquo;uh huh.&rsquo; You aren&#39;t necessarily agreeing with the person, you are simply indicating that you are listening. Using body language and other signs to acknowledge you are listening also reminds you to pay attention and not let your mind wander.</p>

				<p>You should also try to respond to the speaker in a way that will both encourage him or her to continue speaking, so that you can get the information if you need. While nodding and &lsquo;uh huhing&rsquo; says you&#39;re interested, an occasional question or comment to recap what has been said communicates that you understand the message as well.</p>

				<h4>Becoming an Active Listener</h4>

				<p>There are five key elements of active listening. They all help you ensure that you hear the other person, and that the other person knows you are hearing what they are saying.</p>

				<p><strong>1. Pay attention.</strong></p>

				<p>Give the speaker your undivided attention and acknowledge the message. Recognize that what is not said also speaks loudly.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Look at the speaker directly.</li>
					<li>Put aside distracting thoughts. Don&#39;t mentally prepare a rebuttal!</li>
					<li>Avoid being distracted by environmental factors.</li>
					<li>&lsquo;Listen&rsquo; to the speaker&#39;s body language.</li>
					<li>Refrain from side conversations when listening in a group setting.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>2. Show that you are listening.</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Use your own body language and gestures to convey your attention.</li>
					<li>Nod occasionally.</li>
					<li>Smile and use other facial expressions.</li>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">130</span></div>

					<li>Note your posture and make sure it is open and inviting.</li>
					<li>Encourage the speaker to continue with small verbal comments like yes, and uh huh.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>3. Provide feedback.</strong></p>

				<p>Our personal filters, assumptions, judgments, and beliefs can distort what we hear. As a listener, your role is to understand what is being said. This may require you to reflect what is being said and ask questions.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Reflect what has been said by paraphrasing. &lsquo;What I&#39;m hearing is...&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sounds like you are saying...&rsquo; are great ways to reflect back.</li>
					<li>Ask questions to clarify certain points. &lsquo;What do you mean when you say...&rsquo; &lsquo;Is this what you mean?&rsquo;</li>
					<li>Summarize the speaker&#39;s comments periodically.</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Tip:</strong>
					<p>If you find yourself responding emotionally to what someone said, say so, and ask for more information: &lsquo;I may not be understanding you correctly, and I find myself taking what you said personally. What I thought you just said is XXX; is that what you meant?&rsquo;</p>
				</div>

				<p><strong>4. Defer judgment.</strong></p>

				<p>Interrupting is a waste of time. It frustrates the speaker and limits full understanding of the message.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Allow the speaker to finish.</li>
					<li>Don&#39;t interrupt with counterarguments.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>5. Respond Appropriately.</strong></p>

				<p>Active listening is a model for respect and understanding. You are gaining information and perspective. You add nothing by attacking the speaker or otherwise putting him or her down.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Be candid, open, and honest in your response.</li>
					<li>Assert your opinions respectfully.</li>
					<li>Treat the other person as he or she would want to be treated.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Key Points</h4>

				<p>It takes a lot of concentration and determination to be an active listener. Old habits are hard to break, and if your listening habits are as bad as many people&#39;s are, then there&#39;s a lot of habit-breaking to do!</p>

				<p>Be deliberate with your listening and remind yourself constantly that your goal is to truly hear what the other person is saying. Set aside all other thoughts and behaviors and concentrate on the message. Ask question, reflect, and paraphrase to ensure you understand the message. If you don&#39;t, then you&#39;ll find that what someone says to you and what you hear can be amazingly different!</p>

				<p>Start using active listening today to become a better communicator and improve your workplace productivity and relationships.</p>

				<h3>Effective Email</h3>
				<div class="header-caption">How to communicate powerfully by email</div>

				<p class="skimmable">When you&#39;re trying to locate some information in an e-mail someone sent you a few weeks back, what helps you find it quickly? If the sender included the information you want in a long message covering lots of points, the chances are that it will take you time to find it. Worse, if the sender is someone you communicate with regularly, and he or she just pressed Reply to a previous message about a different point, the heading of the mail you need won&#39;t actually be related to the information you want.</p>

				<p>There are a few simple rules to ensure that your emails are read in the first place and stay useful to the recipient.</p>

				<h4>Subject Lines are Headlines</h4>

				<p>The headline in a newspaper does two things: It grabs your attention and informs you what the article is about so you can decide whether you want to read further. Email subject lines need to do the same thing. Use the subject line to inform the receiver of EXACTLY what the email is about in a few well-chosen words. You might include a call to action such as &lsquo;Please respond by 7 November&rsquo;, and if your message is one of a regular series of mails, such as a weekly project report, include the date in the subject line too.</p>

				<p>Because everyone gets emails they do not want &#40;spam&#41;, appropriate use of the subject line increases the chances your email will be read and not deleted without so much as a glance.</p>

				<p>Of course, just as it would be ridiculous to publish a newspaper without headlines, never leave the subject line blank.</p>

				<h4>Make One Point per Email</h4>

				<p>The beauty of email, compared with letters, is that it doesn&#39;t cost any more to send several mails than it does to send one. So, if you need to communicate with someone about several matters, write a separate email on each subject. That way your correspondent can reply to each one in the appropriate time-frame. One topic might only require a short reply that he or she can make straight away. Another topic might require more research. By writing separate emails, you get clearer answers.</p>

				<p>However, as with traditional business letters, the email should be clear and concise, with the purpose of the email detailed in the very first paragraph. Sentences should be kept short and to the point.</p>

				<p>The body of the email should contain all pertinent information &#40;see our articles on Writing Skills and on The Rhetorical Triangle&#41; and should be direct and informative.</p>

				<h4>Specify the Response You Want</h4>

				<p>Make sure to include any call to action you desire, such as a phone call or follow-up appointment. Then, make sure you include your contact information, including your name, title, and phone numbers. Do this even with internal messages: The easier you make it for someone else to respond, the more likely they are to do so.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">132</span></div>

				<h4>Be a Good Correspondent</h4>

				<p>If you regularly correspond using email, make sure to clean out your email inbox at least once each day. This is a simple act of courtesy and will also serve to encourage senders to return your emails in a timely manner.</p>

				<p>If a lengthy response is required to an email, but you don&#39;t have the time to pull together the information required now, send a holding reply saying that you have received the message, and indicating when you will respond fully.</p>

				<p>Always set your Out of Office agent when you are going to be away from your email for a day or more, whether on leave or because you&#39;re at meetings.</p>

				<h4>Internal Email</h4>

				<p>Internal email should be checked regularly throughout the working day and returned in a much quicker manner as it often involves timely projects, immediate updates, meeting notes, and so on. Nonetheless, internal emails, just like other emails, should not be informal. Remember, these are written forms of communication that can be printed out and viewed by others than those originally intended for. Always use your spell checker, and avoid slang.</p>

				<h3>Writing Skills</h3>
				<div class="header-caption">Getting your written message across clearly</div>

				<p class="skimmable">A colleague has just sent you an email relating to a meeting you&#39;3re having in one hour&#39;3s time. The email is supposed to contain key information that you need to present, as part of the business case for an important project.</p>

				<p>But there&#39;3s a problem: The email is so badly written that you can&#39;3t find the data you need. There are misspellings and incomplete sentences, and the paragraphs are so long and confusing that it takes you three times more than it should to find the information you want.</p>

				<p>As a result, you&#39;3re under-prepared for the meeting, and it doesn&#39;3t go as well as you want it to.</p>

				<p>Have you ever faced a situation similar to this? In today&#39;3s information overload world, it&#39;3s vital to communicate clearly, concisely and effectively. People don&#39;3t have time to read book-length emails, and they don&#39;3t have the patience to scour badly-constructed emails for &ldquo;buried&rdquo; points.</p>

				<p>The better your writing skills are, the better the impression you&#39;3ll make on the people around you - including your boss, your colleagues, and your clients. You never know how far these good impressions will take you!</p>

				<p>In this article, we&#39;3ll look at how you can improve your writing skills and avoid common mistakes.</p>

				<h4>Audience and Format</h4>

				<p>The first step to writing clearly is choosing the appropriate format. Do you need to send an informal email? Write a detailed report? Create advertising copy? Or write a formal letter?</p>

				<p>The format, as well as your audience, will define your &ldquo;writing voice&rdquo; - that is, how formal or relaxed the tone should be. For instance, if you write an email to a prospective client, should it have the same tone as an email to a friend?</p>

				<p>Definitely not.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">133</span></div>

				<p>Start by identifying who will read your message. Is it targeted at senior managers, the entire human resources team, or a small group of engineers? With everything you write, your readers, or recipients, should define your tone as well as aspects of the content.</p>

				<h4>Composition and Style</h4>

				<p>Once you know what you&#39;re writing, and for whom you&#39;re writing, you actually have to start writing.</p>

				<p>A blank, white computer screen is often intimidating. And it&#39;s easy to get stuck because you don&#39;t know how to start. Try these tips for composing and styling your document:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Start with your audience</strong> - Remember, your readers may know nothing about what you&#39;re telling them. What do they need to know first?</li>
					<li><strong>Create an outline</strong> - This is especially helpful if you&#39;re writing a longer document such as a report, presentation, or speech. Outlines help you identify which steps to take in which order, and they help you break the task up into manageable pieces of information.</li>
					<li><strong>Use AIDA</strong> - If you&#39;re writing something that must inspire action in the reader, follow the Attention-Interest-Desire-Action &#40;AIDA&#41; formula. These four steps can help guide you through the writing process.</li>
					<li><strong>Try some empathy</strong> - For instance, if you&#39;re writing a sales letter for prospective clients, why should they care about your product or sales pitch? What&#39;s the benefit for them? Remember your audience&#39;s needs at all times.</li>
					<li><strong>Use the Rhetorical Triangle</strong> - If you&#39;re trying to persuade someone to do something, make sure that you communicate why people should listen to you, pitch your message in a way that engages your audience, and present information rationally and coherently. Our article on the Rhetorical Triangle can help you make your case in the most effective way.</li>
					<li><strong>Identify your main theme</strong> - If you&#39;re having trouble defining the main theme of your message, pretend that you have 15 seconds to explain your position. What do you say? This is likely to be your main theme.</li>
					<li><strong>Use simple language</strong> - Unless you&#39;re writing a scholarly article, it&#39;s usually best to use simple, direct language. Don&#39;t use long words just to impress people.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Structure</h4>

				<p>Your document should be as &ldquo;reader friendly&rdquo; as possible. Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbering whenever possible to break up the text.</p>

				<p>After all, what&#39;s easier to read - a page full of long paragraphs, or a page that&#39;s broken up into short paragraphs, with section headings and bullet points? A document that&#39;s easy to scan will get read more often than a document with long, dense paragraphs of text.</p>

				<p>Headers should grab the reader&#39;s attention. Using questions is often a good idea, especially in advertising copy or reports, because questions help keep the reader engaged and curious.</p>

				<p>In emails and proposals, use short, factual headings and subheadings, like the ones in this article.</p>

				<p>Adding graphs and charts is also a smart way to break up your text. These visual aids not only keep the reader&#39;s eye engaged, but they can communicate important information much more quickly than text.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">134</span></div>

				<h4>Grammatical Errors</h4>

				<p>You probably don&#39;t need us to tell you that errors in your document will make you look unprofessional. It&#39;s essential to learn grammar properly, and to avoid common mistakes that your spell checker won&#39;t find.</p>

				<p>Here are some examples of commonly misused words:</p>

				<p><strong>Affect&#47;effect</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>&ldquo;Affect&rdquo; is a verb meaning to influence. &#40;Example: The economic forecast will affect our projected income.&#41;</li>
					<li>&ldquo;Effect&rdquo; is a noun meaning the result or outcome. &#40;Example: What is the effect of the proposal?&#41;</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Then&#47;than</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>&ldquo;Then&rdquo; is typically an adverb indicating a sequence in time. &#40;Example: We went to dinner, then we saw a movie.&#41;</li>
					<li>&ldquo;Than&rdquo; is a conjunction used for comparison. &#40;Example: The dinner was more expensive than the movie.&#41;</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Your&#47;you&#39;re</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>&ldquo;Your&rdquo; is a possessive. &#40;Example: Is that your file?&#41;</li>
					<li>&ldquo;You&#39;re&rdquo; is a contraction of "you are." &#40;Example: You&#39;re the new manager.&#41;</li>
					<li>Note: Also watch out for other common homophones &#40;words that sound alike but have different spellings and meanings&#41; - such as their&#47;they&#39;re&#47;there, to&#47;too&#47;two, and so on.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Its&#47;it&#39;s</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>&ldquo;Its&rdquo; is a possessive. &#40;Example: Is that its motor?&#41;</li>
					<li>&ldquo;It&#39;s&rdquo; is a contraction of &ldquo;It is.&rdquo; &#40;Example: It&#39;s often that heavy.&#41; &#40;Yes, it is this way around!&#41;</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Company&#39;s&#47;companies &#40;and other possessives versus plurals&#41;</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>&ldquo;Company&#39;s&rdquo; indicates possession. &#40;Example: The company&#39;s trucks hadn&#39;t been maintained properly.&#41;</li>
					<li>&ldquo;Companies&rdquo; is plural. &#40;Example: The companies in this industry are suffering.&#41;</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Tip:</strong>
					<p>Some of your readers - arguably an increasing number - won&#39;t be perfect at spelling and grammar. They may not notice if you make these errors. But don&#39;t use this as an excuse: there will usually be people, senior managers in particular, who WILL notice!</p>
					<p>Because of this, everything you write should be of a quality that every reader will find acceptable.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">135</span></div>

				<h4>Proofing</h4>

				<p>The enemy of good proofreading is speed. Many people rush through their documents, but this is how you miss mistakes. Follow these guidelines to check what you&#39;ve written:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Proof your headers and subheaders</strong> - People often skip these and focus on the text alone. Just because headers are big and bold doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re error free!</li>
					<li><strong>Read the document out loud</strong> - This forces you to go more slowly, so that you&#39;re more likely to catch mistakes.</li>
					<li><strong>Use your finger to follow text as you read</strong> - This is another trick that helps you slow down.</li>
					<li><strong>Start at the end of your document</strong> - Proofread one sentence at a time, working your way from the end to the beginning. This helps you focus on errors, not on content.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Key Points</h4>

				<p>More than ever, it&#39;s important to know how to communicate your point quickly and professionally. Many people spend a lot of time writing and reading, so the better you are at this form of communication, the more successful you&#39;re likely to be.</p>

				<p>Identify your audience before you start creating your document. And if you feel that there&#39;s too much information to include, create an outline to help organize your thoughts. Learning grammatical and stylistic techniques will also help you write more clearly; and be sure to proof the final document. Like most things, the more you write, the better you&#39;re going to be!</p>

				<h3>Charts and Graphs</h3>
				<div class="header-caption">Choosing the right format</div>

				<p class="skimmable">&lsquo;A picture is worth a thousand words.&rsquo; This is certainly true when you&#39;re presenting and explaining data. You can provide tables setting out the figures, and you can talk about numbers, percentages, and relationships forever. However, the chances are that your point will be lost if you rely on these alone. Put up a graph or a chart, and suddenly everything you&#39;re saying makes sense!</p>

				<p>Graphs or charts help people understand data quickly. Whether you want to make a comparison, show a relationship, or highlight a trend, they help your audience &lsquo;see&rsquo; what you are talking about.</p>

				<p>The trouble is there are so many different types of charts and graphs that it&#39;s difficult to know which one to choose. Click on the chart option in your spreadsheet program and you&#39;re presented with many styles. They all look smart, but which one is appropriate for the data you&#39;ve collected?</p>

				<p>Can you use a bar graph to show a trend? Is a line graph appropriate for sales data? When do you use a pie chart? The spreadsheet will chart anything you tell it to, whether the end result makes sense or not. It just takes its orders and executes them!</p>

				<p>To figure out what orders to give, you need to have a good understanding of the mechanics of charts, graphs and diagrams. We&#39;ll show you the basics using four very common graph types:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Line graph.</li>
					<li>Bar graph.</li>
					<li>Pie chart.</li>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">136</span></div>

					<li>Venn diagram.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>First we&#39;ll start with some basics.</p>

				<h4>X and Y Axes - Which is Which?</h4>

				<p>To create most charts or graphs, excluding pie charts, you typically use data that is plotted in two dimensions, as shown in Figure 1.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The horizontal dimension is the x-axis.</li>
					<li>The vertical dimension is the y-axis.</li>
				</ul>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure1section9.11.png">
				</figure>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Tip:</strong>
					<p>To remember which axis is which, think of the x-axis as going <strong>a</strong>long the corridor and the y-axis as going <strong>u</strong>p the stairs. The letter &lsquo;a&rsquo; comes before &lsquo;u&rsquo; in the alphabet just as &lsquo;x&rsquo; comes before &lsquo;y&rsquo;.</p>
				</div>
				
				<p>When you come to plot data, the known value goes on the x-axis and the measured &#40;or &lsquo;unknown&rsquo;&#41; value on the y-axis. For example, if you were to plot the measured average temperature for a number of months, you&#39;d set up axes as shown in Figure 2:</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure2section9.11.png">
				</figure>

				<p>The next issue you face is deciding what type of graph to use.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">137</span></div>

				<h4>Line Graphs</h4>

				<p>One of the most common graphs you will encounter is a line graph. Line graphs simply use a line to connect the data points that you plot. They are most useful for showing trends, and for identifying whether two variables relate to &#40;or &lsquo;correlate with&rsquo;&#41; one another.</p>

				<p>Trend data:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>How do sales vary from month to month?</li>
					<li>How does engine performance change as its temperature increases?</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Correlation:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>On average, how much sleep do people get, based on their age?</li>
					<li>Does the distance a child lives from school affect how frequently he or she is late?</li>
				</ul>

				<p>You can only use line graphs when the variable plotted along the x-axis is continuous - for example, time, temperature or distance.</p>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Note:</strong>
					<p>When the y-axis indicates a quantity or percent and the x-axis represents units of time, the line graph is often referred to as a time series graph.</p>
				</div>

				<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

				<p>ABC Enterprises&#39; sales vary throughout the year. By plotting sales figures on a line graph, as shown in Figure 3 , it&#39;s easy to see the main fluctuations during the course of a year. Here, sales drop off during the summer months, and around New Year.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure3section9.11.png">
				</figure>

				<p>While some seasonal variation may be unavoidable in the line of business ABC Enterprises is in, it may be possible to boost cash flows during the low periods through marketing activity and special offers.</p>

				<p>Line graphs can also depict multiple series. In this example you might have different trend lines for different product categories or store locations, as shown in Figure 4 below. It&#39;s easy to compare trends when they&#39;re represented on the same graph.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">138</span></div>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure4section9.11.png">
				</figure>

				<h4>Bar Graphs</h4>

				<p>Another type of graph that shows relationships between different data series is the bar graph. Here the height of the bar represents the measured value or frequency: The higher or longer the bar, the greater the value.</p>

				<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

				<p>ABC Enterprises sells three different models of its main product, the Alpha, the Platinum, and the Deluxe. By plotting the sales each model over a three year period, it becomes easy to see trends that might be masked by a simple analysis of the figures themselves. In Figure 5, you can see that, although the Deluxe is the highest-selling of the three, its sales have dropped off over the three year period, while sales of the other two have continued to grow. Perhaps the Deluxe is becoming outdated and needs to be replaced with a new model? Or perhaps it&#39;s suffering from stiffer competition than the other two?</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure5section9.11.png">
				</figure>

				<p>Of course, you could also represent this data on a multiple series line graph as shown in Figure 6.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">139</span></div>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure6section9.11.png">
				</figure>

				<p>Often the choice comes down to how easy the trend is to spot. In this example the line graph actually works better than the bar graph, but this might not be the case if the chart had to show data for 20 models rather than just three. It&#39;s worth noting, though, that if you can use a line graph for your data you can often use a bar graph just as well.</p>

				<p>The opposite is not always true. When your x-axis variables represent discontinuous data &#40;such as different products or sales territories&#41;, you can only use a bar graph.</p>

				<p>In general, line graphs are used to demonstrate data that is related on a continuous scale, whereas bar graphs are used to demonstrate discontinuous data.</p>

				<p>Data can also be represented on a horizontal bar graph as shown in Figure 7. This is often the preferred method when you need more room to describe the measured variable. It can be written on the side of the graph rather than squashed underneath the x-axis.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure7section9.11.png">
				</figure>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">140</span></div>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Note:</strong>
					<p>A bar graph is not the same as a histogram. On a histogram, the width of the bar varies according to the range of the x-axis variable &#40;for example, 0-2, 3-10, 11-20, 20-40 and so on&#41; and the area of the column indicates the frequency of the data. With a bar graph, it is only the height of the bar that matters.</p>
				</div>

				<h4>Pie Charts</h4>

				<p>A pie chart compares parts to a whole. As such it shows a percentage distribution. The entire pie represents the total data set and each segment of the pie is a particular category within the whole.</p>

				<p>So, to use a pie chart, the data you are measuring must depict a ratio or percentage relationship. You must always use the same unit of measure within a pie chart. Otherwise your numbers will mean nothing.</p>

				<p>The pie chart in Figure 8 shows where ABC Enterprise&#39;s sales come from.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure8section9.11.png">
				</figure>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">141</span></div>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Tip 1:</strong>
					<p>Be careful not to use too many segments in your pie chart. More than about six and it gets far too crowded. Here it is better to use a bar chart instead.</p>
					<strong>Tip 2:</strong>
					<p>If you want to emphasize one of the segments, you can detach it a bit from the main pie. This visual separation makes it stand out.</p>
					<strong>Tip 3:</strong>
					<p>For all their obvious usefulness, pie charts do have limitations, and can be misleading. Click here for a thoughtful argument against use of pie charts. &#40;Thanks to Anne Chappuis for the reference.&#41;</p>
				</div>

				<h4>Venn Diagrams</h4>

				<p>The last graph we will cover here is the Venn diagram. Devised by the mathematician John Venn in 1881, this is a diagram used to show overlaps between sets of data.</p>

				<p>Each set is represented by a circle. The degree of overlap between the sets is depicted by the overlap between circles.</p>

				<p>Figure 9 shows sales at Perfect Printing. There are three product lines: stationery printing, newsletter printing, and customized promotional items such as mugs.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure9section9.11.png">
				</figure>

				<p>By separating out the proportions of the business&#39; customers that buy each type of product, it becomes clear that the majority of the biggest group of customers &#40;55% of the total&#41; - those who have their company stationery printed - are only using Perfect Printing for stationery. It&#39;s possible that they don&#39;t realize that Perfect Printing could also print their company newsletters and promotional items. As a result, Perfect Printing should consider designing some marketing activity to promote these product lines to its stationery customers.</p>

				<p>Customers who get their newsletters printed by Perfect Printing, on the other hand, seem to be well aware that the company also offers stationery printing and promotional items.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">142</span></div>

				<p>A Venn diagram is a great choice to use when you are trying to convey the amount of commonality or difference between distinct groups.</p>

				<h4>Key Points</h4>

				<p>There are many chart and diagram formats you can choose from when representing information graphically. Selecting the right type starts with a good understanding of how each is created.</p>

				<p>When you are clear about the specific sort of data the main types can be used to represent, you will be much more comfortable using the different types of chart in your analysis. This will add great value and improve the clarity and effectiveness of your communication.</p>

				<div class="yellow-background">
					<div class="grey-header">Apply This to Your Life:</div>
					<p>Next time you are wading through piles of numbers or analyzing relationships between variables, stop and consider how you could summarize the information you are gathering.

				<h3>AIDA: Attention-Interest-Desire-Action</h3>
				<div class="header-caption">Inspiring action with your writing</div>

				<p><em>&lsquo;Free gift inside!&rsquo;<br/>
				&lsquo;Dear Jim, You have been specially selected...&rsquo;<br/>
				&lsquo;Calling all Parents.&rsquo;</em></p>

				<p class="skimmable">Every day we&#39;re bombarded with headlines like these that are designed to grab our attention. In a world full of advertising and information - delivered in all sorts of media from print to websites, billboards to radio, and TV to text messages - every message has to work extremely hard to get noticed.</p>

				<p>And it&#39;s not just advertising messages that have to work hard; every report you write, presentation you deliver, or email you send is competing for your audience&#39;s attention.</p>

				<p>As the world of advertising becomes more and more competitive, advertising becomes more and more sophisticated. Yet the basic principles behind advertising copy remain - that it must attract attention and persuade someone to take action. And this idea remains true simply because human nature doesn&#39;t really change. Sure, we become increasingly discerning, but to persuade people to do something, you still need to grab their attention, interest them in how your product or service can help them, and then persuade them to take the action you want them to take, such as buying your product or visiting your website.</p>

				<p>The acronym AIDA is a handy tool for ensuring that your copy, or other writing, grabs attention. The acronym stands for:</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">143</span></div>

				<ul>
					<li>Attention &#40;or Attract&#41;</li>
					<li>Interest</li>
					<li>Desire</li>
					<li>Action</li>
				</ul>

				<p>These are the four steps you need to take your audience through if you want them to buy your product or visit your website, or indeed to take on board the messages in your report.</p>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<p>A slightly more sophisticated version of this is AIDCA&#47;AIDEA, which includes an additional step of Conviction/Evidence between Desire and Action. People are so cynical about advertising messages that coherent evidence may be needed if anyone is going to act!</p>
				</div>

				<h4>How to Use the Tool</h4>

				<p>Use the AIDCA approach when you write a piece of text that has the ultimate objective of getting others to take action. The elements of the acronym are as follows:</p>

				<p><strong>1. Attention/Attract</strong></p>

				<p>In our media-filled world, you need to be quick and direct to grab people&#39;s attention. Use powerful words, or a picture that will catch the reader&#39;s eye and make them stop and read what you have to say next.</p>

				<p>With most office workers suffering from e-mail overload, action-seeking e-mails need subject lines that will encourage recipients to open them and read the contents. For example, to encourage people to attend a company training session on giving feedback, the email headline, &lsquo;How effective is YOUR feedback?&rsquo; is more likely to grab attention than the purely factual one of, &lsquo;This week&#39;s seminar on feedback&rsquo;.</p>

				<p><strong>2. Interest</strong></p>

				<p>This is one of the most challenging stages: You&#39;ve got the attention of a chunk of your target audience, but can you engage with them enough so that they&#39;ll want to spend their precious time understanding your message in more detail?</p>

				<p>Gaining the reader&#39;s interest is a deeper process than grabbing their attention. They will give you a little more time to do it, but you must stay focused on their needs. This means helping them to pick out the messages that are relevant to them quickly. So use bullets and subheadings, and break up the text to make your points stand out.</p>

				<p>For more information on understanding your target audience&#39;s interests and expectations, and the context of your message, read our article on the Rhetorical Triangle.</p>

				<p><strong>3. Desire</strong></p>

				<p>The Interest and Desire parts of AIDA go hand-in-hand: As you&#39;re building the reader&#39;s interest, you also need to help them understand how what you&#39;re offering can help them in a real way. The main way of doing this is by appealing to their personal needs and wants..</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">144</span></div>

				<p>So, rather than simply saying &lsquo;Our lunchtime seminar will teach you feedback skills&rsquo;, explain to the audience what&#39;s in it for them: &lsquo;Get what you need from other people, and save time and frustration, by learning how to give them good feedback.&rsquo;</p>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Feature and Benefits &#40;FAB&#41;</strong>
					<p>A good way of building the reader&#39;s desire for your offering is to link features and benefits. Hopefully, the significant features of your offering have been designed to give a specific benefit to members of your target market.</p>
					<p>When it comes to the marketing copy, it&#39;s important that you don&#39;t forget those benefits at this stage. When you describe your offering, don&#39;t just give the facts and features, and expect the audience to work out the benefits for themselves: Tell them the benefits clearly to create that interest and desire.</p>
					<p>Example: &lsquo;This laptop case is made of aluminum,&rsquo; describes a feature, and leaves the audience thinking &lsquo;So what?&rsquo; Persuade the audience by adding the benefits: &lsquo;giving a stylish look, that&#39;s kinder to your back and shoulders&rsquo;.</p>
					<p>You may want to take this further by appealing to people&#39;s deeper drives &lsquo;... giving effortless portability and a sleek appearance and that will be the envy of your friends and co-workers.&rsquo;</p>
				</div>

				<p><strong>4. Conviction</strong></p>

				<p>As hardened consumers, we tend to be skeptical about marketing claims. It&#39;s no longer enough simply to say that a book is a bestseller, for example, but readers will take notice if you state &#40;accurately, of course!&#41;, that the book has been in the New York Times Bestseller List for 10 weeks, for example. So try to use hard data where it&#39;s available. When you haven&#39;t got the hard data, yet the product offering is sufficiently important, consider generating some data, for example, by commissioning a survey.</p>

				<p>Finally, be very clear about what action you want your readers to take; for example, &lsquo;Visit www.mindtools.com now for more information&rsquo; rather than just leaving people to work out what to do for themselves.</p>

				<h4>Key Points</h4>

				<p>AIDA is a copywriting acronym that stands for:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Attract or Attention</li>
					<li>Interest</li>
					<li>Desire</li>
					<li>Action</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Using it will help you ensure that any kind of writing, whose purpose is to get the reader to do something, is as effective as possible. First it must grab the target audience&#39;s attention, and engage their interest. Then it must build a desire for the product offering, before setting out how to take the action that the writer wants the audience to take.</p>

				<h3>Running Effective Meetings</h3>

				<p class="skimmable">Meetings are wonderful tools for generating ideas, expanding on thoughts and managing group activity. But this face-to-face contact with team members and colleagues can easily fail without adequate preparation and leadership.</p>

				<h4>The Importance of Preparation</h4>

				<p>To ensure everyone involved has the opportunity to provide their input, start your meeting off on the right foot by designating a meeting time that allows all participants the time needed to adequately prepare.</p>

				<p>Once a meeting time and place has been chosen, make yourself available for questions that may arise as participants prepare for the meeting. If you are the meeting leader, make a meeting agenda, complete with detailed notes.</p>

				<p>In these notes, outline the goal and proposed structure of the meeting, and share this with the participants. This will allow all involved to prepare and to come to the meeting ready to work together to meet the goal&#40;s&#41; at hand.</p>

				<p>The success of the meeting depends largely on the skills displayed by the meeting leader. To ensure the meeting is successful, the leader should:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Issue an agenda.</li>
					<li>Start the discussion and encourage active participation.</li>
					<li>Work to keep the meeting at a comfortable pace - not moving too fast or too slow.</li>
					<li>Summarize the discussion and the recommendations at the end of each logical section.</li>
					<li>Ensure all participants receive minutes promptly.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>While these tips will help ensure your meeting is productive and well-received, there are other important areas that need to be touched on to make sure your meeting and negotiation skills are fine-tuned.</p>

				<h4>Managing a Meeting</h4>

				<p>Choosing the right participants is key to the success of any meeting. Make sure all participants can contribute and choose good decision-makers and problem-solvers. Try to keep the number of participants to a maximum of 12, preferably fewer. Make sure the people with the necessary information for the items listed in the meeting agenda are the ones that are invited.</p>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Tip:</strong>
					<p>Stop for a minute to consider the hourly cost to your organization of the people attending your meeting. You&#39;ll realise that calling a meeting is expensive, so it&#39;s important to ensure that every person attending and every minute of your meeting adds value. So don&#39;t invite people who won&#39;t participate but will simply report back to their boss or team &#40;sending a copy of the minutes will be a more effective way of achieving this&#41;. Equally, don&#39;t use meetings to tell people things that could be communicated just as effectively by email or memo.</p>
				</div>

				<p>If you are the leader, work diligently to ensure everyone&#39;s thoughts and ideas are heard by guiding the meeting so that there is a free flow of debate with no individual dominating and no extensive discussions between two people. As time dwindles for each item on the distributed agenda, you</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">146</span></div>

				<p>may find it useful to stop the discussion, then quickly summarize the debate on that agenda item and move on the next item on the agenda.</p>

				<p>When an agenda item is resolved or action is agreed upon, make it clear who in the meeting will be responsible for this. In an effort to bypass confusion and misunderstandings, summarize the action to be taken and include this in the meeting&#39;s minutes.</p>

				<h4>Time Keeping</h4>

				<p>Meetings are notorious for eating up people&#39;s time. Here are some ways of ensuring that time is not wasted in meetings:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Start on time.</li>
					<li>Don&#39;t recap what you&#39;ve covered if someone comes in late: doing so sends the message that it is OK to be late for meetings, and it wastes everyone else&#39;s valuable time.</li>
					<li>State a finish time for the meeting and don&#39;t over-run.</li>
					<li>To help stick to the stated finish time, arrange your agenda in order of importance so that if you have to omit or rush items at the end to make the finish time, you don&#39;t omit or skimp on important items.</li>
					<li>Finish the meeting before the stated finish time if you have achieved everything you need to.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Issuing Minutes</h4>

				<p>Minutes record the decisions of the meeting and the actions agreed. They provide a record of the meeting and, importantly, they provide a review document for use at the next meeting so that progress can be measured - this makes them a useful disciplining technique as individuals&#39; performance and non-performance of agreed actions is given high visibility.</p>

				<p>The style of the minutes issued depends on the circumstances - in situations of critical importance and where the record is important, then you may need to take detailed minutes. Where this is not the case, then minutes can be simple lists of decisions made and of actions to be taken &#40;with the responsible person identified&#41;. Generally, they should be as short as possible as long as all key information is shown - this makes them quick and easy to prepare and digest.</p>

				<p>It is always impressive if the leader of a meeting issues minutes within 24 hours of the end of the meeting - it&#39;s even better if they are issued on the same day.</p>

				<h3>Ice Breakers</h3>
				<div class="header-caption">Getting everyone to contribute at the start of a successful event</div>

				<p class="skimmable">Ice Breakers can be an effective way of starting a training session or team-building event. As interactive and often fun sessions run before the main proceedings, they help people get to know each other and buy into the purpose of the event.</p>

				<p>If an ice breaker session is well-designed and well-facilitated, it can really help get things off to a great start. By getting to know each other, getting to know the facilitators and learning about the objectives of the event, people can become more engaged in the proceedings and so contribute more effectively towards a successful outcome.</p>

				<p>But have you ever been to an event when the ice breaker session went badly? Just as a great ice breaker session can smooth the way for a great event, so a bad ice breaker session can be a recipe</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">147</span></div>

				<p>for disaster. A bad ice breaker session is at best simply a waste of time, or worse an embarrassment for everyone involved.</p>

				<p>As a facilitator, the secret of a successful icebreaking session is to keep it simple: Design the session with specific objectives in mind and make sure the session is appropriate and comfortable for everyone involved.</p>

				<p>This article helps you think through the objectives of your ice breaker session, and then suggests various types of ice breaker you might use. As a facilitator, make sure your ice breakers are remembered for the right reasons - as a great start to a great event!</p>

				<h4>When to Use Icebreakers</h4>

				<p>As the name suggests, an ice breaker session is designed to &lsquo;break the ice&rsquo; at an event or meeting. The technique is often used when people who do not usually work together, or may not know each other at all, meet for a specific, common purpose.</p>

				<p>Consider using an ice breaker when:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Participants come from different backgrounds.</li>
					<li>People need to bond quickly so as to work towards a common goal.</li>
					<li>Your team is newly formed.</li>
					<li>The topics you are discussing are new or unfamiliar to many people involved.</li>
					<li>As facilitator you need to get to know participants and have them know you better.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>So What&#39;s the &lsquo;Ice&rsquo;?</h4>

				<p>When designing your ice breaker, think about the &lsquo;ice&rsquo; that needs to be broken.</p>

				<p>If you are bringing together like-minded people, the &lsquo;ice&rsquo; may simply reflect the fact that people have not yet met.</p>

				<p>If you are bringing together people of different grades and levels in your organization for an open discussion, the &lsquo;ice&rsquo; may come from the difference in status between participants.</p>

				<p>If you are bringing together people of different backgrounds, cultures and outlooks for work within your community, then the &lsquo;ice&rsquo; may come from people&#39;s perceptions of each other.</p>

				<p>You&#39;ll need to handle these differences sensitively. Only focus on what&#39;s important to your event. &#40;Remember, you want to break some ice for your event, not uncover the whole iceberg, or bring about world peace!&#41;</p>

				<p>And as you move on to design and facilitate the event, it&#39;s always best to focus on similarities &#40;rather than differences&#41;, such as a shared interest in the event&#39;s outcome.</p>

				<h4>Designing Your Icebreaker</h4>

				<p>The key to a successful ice breaker is to make sure the ice breaker is specifically focused on meeting your objectives and appropriate to the group of people involved.</p>

				<p>Once you have established what the &lsquo;ice&rsquo; is, the next step is to clarify the specific objectives for your ice breaker session.</p>

				<p>For example, when meeting to solve problems at work, the ice breaker objectives may be:</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">148</span></div>

				<p><em>&lsquo;To establish a productive working environment for today&#39;s event with good participation from everyone involved, irrespective of their level or job role in the organization.&rsquo;</em></p>

				<p>With clear objectives, you can start to design the session. Ask yourself questions about how you will meet your objectives. For example:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>&lsquo;How will people become comfortable with contributing?&rsquo;</li>
					<li>&lsquo;How will you establish a level playing field for people with different levels and jobs?&rsquo;</li>
					<li>&lsquo;How will you create a common sense of purpose?&rsquo;</li>
					<li>and so on.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>These questions can be used as a check list once you have designed the ice breaker session:</p>

				<p><em>&lsquo;Will this ice breaker session help people feel comfortable... establish a level playing field... etc&rsquo;</em></p>

				<p>As a further check, you should also ask yourself how each person is likely to react to the session. Will participants feel comfortable? Will they feel the session is appropriate and worthwhile?</p>

				<h4>Example Ice Breakers</h4>

				<p>There are many types of ice breakers, each suited to different types of objectives. Here we look at a few of the more popular types of ice breakers and how they can be used.</p>

				<p><strong>Introductory Ice Breakers</strong></p>

				<p>Introductory ice breakers are used to introduce participants to each other and to facilitate conversation amongst the participants.</p>

				<p><strong><em>The Little Known Fact:</em></strong> Ask participants to share their name, department or role in the organization, length of service, and one little known fact about themselves.</p>

				<p>This &lsquo;little known fact&rsquo; becomes a humanizing element that can help break down differences such as grade &#47; status in future interaction.</p>

				<p><strong><em>True or False:</em></strong> Ask your participants to introduce themselves and make three or four statements about themselves, one of which is false. Now get the rest of the group to vote on which fact is false.</p>

				<p>As well as getting to know each other as individuals, this ice breaker helps to start interaction within the group.</p>

				<p><strong><em>Interviews:</em></strong> Ask participants to get into twos. Each person then interviews his or her partner for a set time while paired up. When the group reconvenes, each person introduces their interviewee to the rest of the group.</p>

				<p><strong><em>Problem Solvers:</em></strong> Ask participants to work in small groups. Create a simple problem scenario for them to work on in a short time. Once the group have analyzed the problem and prepared their feedback, ask each group in turn to present their analysis and solutions to the wider group.</p>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Tip:</strong>
					<p>Choose a fairly simple scenario that everyone can contribute to. The idea is not to solve a real problem but to &lsquo;warm up&rsquo; the group for further interaction or problem solving later in the event. The group will also learn each other&#39;s styles of problem-solving and interaction.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">149</span></div>

				<p><strong>Team-Building Ice Breakers</strong></p>

				<p>Team-building ice breakers are used to bring together individuals who are in the early stages of team building. This can help the people start working together more cohesively towards shared goals or plans.</p>

				<p><strong><em>The Human Web:</em></strong> This ice breaker focuses on how people in the group inter-relate and depend on each other.</p>

				<p>The facilitator begins with a ball of yarn. Keeping one end, pass the ball to one of the participants, and the person to introduce him- or her-self and their role in the organization. Once this person has made their introduction, ask him or her to pass the ball of yarn on to another person in the group. The person handing over the ball must describe how he/she relates &#40;or expects to relate&#41; to the other person. The process continues until everyone is introduced.</p>

				<p>To emphasis the interdependencies amongst the team, the facilitator then pulls on the starting thread and everyone&#39;s hand should move.</p>

				<p><strong><em>Ball Challenge:</em></strong> This exercise creates a simple, timed challenge for the team to help focus on shared goals, and also encourages people to include other people.</p>

				<p>The facilitator arranges the group in a circle and asks each person to throw the ball across the circle, first announcing his or her own name, and then announcing the name of the person to whom they are throwing the ball &#40;the first few times, each person throws the ball to someone whose name they already know.&#41; When every person in the group has thrown the ball at least once, it&#39;s time to set the challenge - to pass the ball around all group members as quickly as possible. Time the process, then ask the group to beat that timing. As the challenge progresses, the team will improve their process, for example by standing closer together. And so the group will learn to work as a team.</p>

				<p><strong><em>Hope, Fears and Expectations:</em></strong> Best done when participants already have a good understanding of their challenge as a team. Group people into 2s or 3s, and ask people to discuss their expectations for the event or work ahead, then what they fears and their hopes. Gather the group&#39;s response by collating 3-4 hopes, fears and expectation from pairing or threesome.</p>

				<p><strong>Topic exploration ice breakers</strong></p>

				<p>Topic exploration ice breakers can be used to explore the topic at the outset, or perhaps to change pace and re-energize people during the even.</p>

				<p><strong><em>Word association:</em></strong> This ice breaker helps people explore the breadth of the area under discussion. Generate a list of words related to the topic of your event or training. For example, in a health and safety workshop, ask participants what words or phrases come to mind relating to &lsquo;hazardous materials&rsquo;. Participants may suggest: &lsquo;danger,&rsquo; &lsquo;corrosive,&rsquo; &lsquo;flammable,&rsquo; &lsquo;warning,&rsquo; &lsquo;skull and crossbones,&rsquo; etc. Write all suggestions on the board, perhaps clustering by theme. You can use this opportunity to introduce essential terms and discuss the scope &#40;what&#39;s in and what&#39;s out&#41; of your training or event.</p>

				<p><strong><em>Burning questions:</em></strong> This ice breaker gives each person the opportunity to ask key questions they hope to cover in the event or training. Again you can use this opportunity to discuss key terminology and scope. Be sure to keep the questions and refer back to them as the event progresses and concludes.</p>

				<p><strong><em>Brainstorm:</em></strong> Brainstorming can be used as an ice breaker or re-energizer during an event. If people are getting bogged down in the detail during problem solving, for example, you can change pace easily by running a quick-fire brainstorming session. If you are looking for answers to customer service problems, try brainstorming how to create problems rather than solve them.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">150</span></div>

				<p>This can help people think creatively again and gives the group a boost when energy levels are flagging.</p>

				<h3>Facilitation</h3>
				<div class="header-caption">Guiding an event through to a successful conclusion</div>

				<p class="skimmable">So you&#39;ve been asked to facilitate a meeting. What does that mean exactly? Do you just ensure everyone&#39;s introduced, and maybe kick off with a quick ice breaker exercise? Is your main role simply to stand by the flip chart and note down all the ideas? What preparation do you need to do? How do you manage the event, and how exactly do you pull the whole thing together?</p>

				<p>In many types of group situation, and particularly in complex discussions or those where people have different views and interests, good facilitation can make the difference between success and failure.</p>

				<p>As a facilitator, you may need to call on a wide range of skills and tools, from problem solving and decision making, to team management and communications.</p>

				<h4>What Is a Facilitator?</h4>

				<p>The definition of facilitate is &lsquo;to make easy&rsquo; or &lsquo;ease a process&rsquo;. What a facilitator does is plan, guide and manage a group event to ensure that the group&#39;s objectives are met effectively, with clear thinking, good participation and full buy-in from everyone who is involved.</p>

				<p>To facilitate effectively, you must be objective. This doesn&#39;t mean you have to come from outside the organization or team, though. It simply means that, for the purposes of this group process, you will take a neutral stance. You step back from the detailed content and from your own personal views, and focus purely on the group process. &#40;The &lsquo;group process&rsquo; is the approach used to manage discussions, get the best from all members, and bring the event through to a successful conclusion. How you design this depends on many factors, and we&#39;ll explore this in a little more detail later in the article. The secret of great facilitation is a group process that flows - and with it will flow the group&#39;s ideas, solutions, and decisions too.&#41;</p>

				<p>Your key responsibility as a facilitator is to create this group process and an environment in which it can flourish, and so help the group reach a successful decision, solution or conclusion.</p>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Tip:</strong>
					<p>Facilitation can take a lot of mental effort, meaning that it can be difficult to think about and contribute content while facilitating. Neutrality is also important. So if you have an interest in the outcome, or have skills, experience, information or authority which is important for a successful outcome, then consider bringing in an external facilitator.</p>
				</div>

				<h4>What Does a Facilitator Do?</h4>

				<p>To facilitate an event well, you must first understand the group&#39;s desired outcome, and the background and context of the meeting or event. The bulk of your responsibility is then to:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Design and plan</strong> the group process, and select the tools that best help the group progress towards that outcome.</li>
					<li><strong>Guide and control</strong> the group process to ensure that:
						<ul>
							<li>There is effective participation.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">151</span></div>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<ul>
							<li>Participants achieve a mutual understanding;.</li>
							<li>Their contributions are considered and included in the ideas, solutions or decisions that emerge.</li>
							<li>Participants take shared responsibility for the outcome.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Ensure that outcomes, actions and questions are properly <strong>recorded and actioned</strong>, and appropriately dealt with afterwards.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>We look in more detail at most important of these areas below.</p>

				<h4>Design and Plan</h4>

				<p>With the group&#39;s objective firmly in mind, preparation for the meeting or event is all-important. Your job is to choose and design the right group process&#40;es&#41;, and develop an effective agenda for the occasion.</p>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Tip 1: Focus on Outcomes</strong>
					<p>Whether you&#39;re planning a straight-forward meeting, or a complex event over several sessions or days, it&#39;s important to keep in mind always the <strong>outcome</strong> - and how you are helping the group reach it.</p>
					<p>If the event spans multiple sessions and topics, make sure you are clear about both the desired outcome and process for each one. And make sure you know how the outcome of each session or topic contributes to the outcome of the event overall.</p>
					<strong>Tip 2: Involve your client!</strong>
					<p>If you&#39;ve been asked to facilitate an event by someone else, make sure you consult him or her carefully as to the final &lsquo;shape&rsquo; of the event. Even if they haven&#39;t been explicit about what they want, they probably have an idea of what they want, and will be unpleasantly surprised if this isn&#39;t delivered.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Two key aspects of the design and planning are choosing the right group process, and designing a realistic agenda.</p>

				<p><strong>Choose and design the group process</strong></p>

				<p>There are as many ways to design a group process as there are events to facilitate: It&#39;s quite an art! Group process design is also a huge topic in its own right, and something that professional facilitators learn through experience and training.</p>

				<p>Here we consider some of the basic options and principle. And there are many tools and techniques here at Mind Tools that will help you facilitate effectively &#40;see the Facilitators&#39; Toolbox below for more details&#41;. There are also many wonderful books and guides on the subject - we recommend that you consult some of these if you&#39;re new to facilitation, or if you&#39;re facing the challenge of facilitating a particularly difficult event.</p>

				<p>Here are some of the just some of the factors and options to consider:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Do you want an open discussion, or a structured process?</strong> An open discussion, well facilitated, may be the simplest option for your group process. But ask yourself whether you will be able to achieve the participation you need, and manage the discussion with the number of participants involved with this format. Can you cover the variety of topics needed? Can you generate enough ideas and solutions? And can you involve everyone, and get their buy-in?</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">152</span></div>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>What structured process should you choose?</strong> If you need to accommodate participation from a large group, consider smaller &lsquo;break-out&rsquo; groups. Are you concerned about getting enough participation? Then give people time in the agenda to think about and write down the things they want to contribute. If you want to get ideas flowing, then consider including a brainstorming session. More information about different structured processes can be found in the Facilitators&#39; Toolbox below.</li>
					<li><strong>Other factors to consider:</strong> You won&#39;t be able to change some constraints. However, you may be able to change others to optimize your process and agenda. As part of this, consider:
						<ul>
							<li>The number of participants.</li>
							<li>The nature of the topics under discussion.</li>
							<li>The type of involvement people need to have.</li>
							<li>The background and positions of the participants.</li>
							<li>How well they know the subject. and each other.</li>
							<li>The time you have available.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Remember, whatever group process you define, it&#39;s a question of keeping your focus on outcomes. Find the best way to achieve the objectives of the overall event.</p>

				<h4>Designing a realistic agenda</h4>

				<p>Designing the agenda goes hand in hand with designing the group process. As you iterate between designing the process and designing the agenda, the event starts to take shape. Among the factors to consider when planning the agenda are:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>In what order should the topics be presented?</li>
					<li>How will participants get to know each other?</li>
					<li>How will they gain a common understanding of the objectives?</li>
					<li>If an event is to be broken into separate sessions, how much time should be allocated to each item?</li>
					<li>Will all participants be involved each session?</li>
					<li>Or will some be in smaller, break-out groups?</li>
					<li>How and when will break-out groups&#39; feed back to the wider group?</li>
					<li>When will you recap and summarize?</li>
					<li>How will the outcomes of one session flow into the next?</li>
					<li>How will you achieve closure of the overall event?</li>
				</ul>

				<p>By the end of the design and planning stage, you should have a solid agenda, which focuses on outcomes, and provides a good flow and structure for the event.</p>

				<p><strong>Other design and planning considerations</strong></p>

				<p>In addition to process and agenda, you should also consider the following:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Information and materials</strong> - What do participants need to know before or at the event? How will this be provided and when?</li>
					<li><strong>Room arrangements</strong> - What room set-up will best encourage participation? Are separate rooms needed for break out groups?</li>
					<li><strong>Supplies</strong> - What supplies and props do you need? Pens, flip charts, post-it notes are just the starters - make sure you have everything you need for the agenda and process you&#39;ve planned. And make sure you have backups for things like data projectors, just in case these fail.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>With the agenda and group process in place, it&#39;s time to think about how you&#39;ll guide and control the proceedings. There&#39;s still some preparation to do for this, and then there&#39;s whole business of guiding and controlling the event itself.</p>

				<p>The final stage of preparation is to think about how you&#39;ll guide and control the meeting. This is where you prepare the ground rules for the event, polish your facilitation skills, and also consider some what-if scenarios: What if there is major disagreement? What if a solution does not emerge? and so on.</p>

				<p>At the meeting itself, as facilitator, you&#39;ll set the scene and ensure that participants are clear about the desired outcome, the agenda, the ground rules and expectations for the event. By doing this, you help everyone focus on the task at hand. At the start of the meeting, and throughout, your role is to use to ensure the meeting keeps progressing towards a successful outcome.</p>

				<p>To guide and control the meeting, you will need to:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Set the ground rules</strong> - What rules should participants follow in the meeting? How will people interact? How will you ensure that people respect each others ideas? How will questions be handled? You&#39;ll prepare some ground rules in advance, and propose and seek agreement to these at the start of the event.</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">154</span></div>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Set the scene</strong> - Here, you&#39;ll run through the objectives and agenda. Make sure everyone understands their role, and what the group is seeking to achieve.</li>
					<li><strong>Get things flowing</strong> - You&#39;ll make sure everyone introduces themselves, or perhaps use appropriate icebreakers to get the meeting off to a positive start. &#40;For more ideas on ice breaking exercises click here&#41;.</li>
					<li><strong>Keep up the momentum and energy</strong> - You might need to intervene as the proceedings and energy levels proceed. Make sure people remain focused and interested. &#40;If energy levels are beginning to flag, perhaps it&#39;s time to take a break?&#41;</li>
					<li><strong>Listen, engage and include</strong> - Even though, as facilitator, you&#39;re taking a neutral stance, you need to stay alert, listen actively, and remain interested and engaged. This sets a good example for other participants, and also means you are always ready to intervene in facilitative ways. Is everyone engaged? If not, how can you bring them in? How can you get better participation?</li>
					<li><strong>Monitor checkpoints, and summarize</strong> - Keep in control of the agenda, tell people what they&#39;ve achieved and what&#39;s next; Summarize often.</li>
					<li><strong>Intervene only if absolutely required.</strong></li>
				</ul>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Tip: Interventions</strong>
					<p>As a facilitator, there are many situations in which you may need to intervene. Rehearse when and how you&#39;ll do this. Keep the lightest of touch. And bear in mind the need to remain objective, keep focus on the desired outcomes, and generally maintain a positive flow.</p>
					<p>The most difficult types of intervention are those involving conflict, anger and disagreement. Remembering your role, it&#39;s important to focus on the needs of the group, whilst considering the feelings and position of both parties involved in any disagreement.</p>
				</div>

				<p>To keep the event flowing and positive:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Watch for and close any side conversations. These limit the ability of others to focus, and often people are exchanging ideas that should be brought to the group.</li>
					<li>Keep a close eye on the timing. Be flexible, and balance the need for participation with the need to keep things running efficiently.</li>
					<li>Learn what to do when a discussion isn&#39;t reaching a natural conclusion. Is more information needed? When and how will the discussion proceed? Park topics that cannot be concluded, and ensure that action time is scheduled to address these issues.</li>
					<li>Be on the lookout for people who aren&#39;t participating fully. Are they experiencing discomfort? What is the source of the discomfort? What can you do to bring them into the conversation?</li>
					<li>Pay attention to group behavior, both verbal and non-verbal. Some of the most damaging behavior is silent, so know how to spot it and stop it effectively.</li>
					<li>Step in and mediate immediately if there are obvious personal attacks. Effective facilitators look for the least intrusive intervention first, so reminding everyone of the ground rules is often a good place to start. Whatever the issue, you can&#39;t allow bad behavior to continue so be prepared to take the steps necessary to stop attacks.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Record and Action</h4>

				<p>Last but not least among the responsibilities of a facilitator is the recording of outputs, and of bringing these together, sharing them, and making sure they are actioned.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">155</span></div>

				<p>The key to successful recording of outputs from an event is to be clear about what will be recorded, how and by whom. Make sure people&#39;s responsibilities are 100% clear, whether they are yours or others&#39; involved.</p>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Tip:</strong>
					<p>When we think of a facilitator, it&#39;s the recording function part of their role that most often comes to mind. We see a person standing in front of an easel that is packed with paper, with felt pen in hand, and ready to write furiously when the ideas start flowing.</p>
					<p>While this is an important function, remember that, for the ideas to flow, the planning, and guiding and controlling functions must be attended to first. You can have all the paper in the world but if your meeting is not well planned, guided, and controlled, you could be facing an empty piece of paper at the end of the event.</p>
				</div>

				<p>When you are recording and actioning, here are some things to remember:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>You are responsible for making sure the participants hear, see, and understand the information that is presented and offered. Make sure you keep an accurate record of what&#39;s going on. If in doubt, record now and summarize later.</li>
					<li>Try to use words that the group chooses, and when in doubt, ask them to provide the words for you to record.</li>
					<li>Ensure all decisions and actions are recorded. You may want to use a scribe to do this, so that you can stay focused on the group and the process.</li>
					<li>As you record decisions and actions, check with the group that the information you&#39;re recording is a fair and accurate reflection of what&#39;s been discussed.</li>
					<li>Remind the group what has been discussed, and keep them focused and moving forward.</li>
					<li>If in doubt, ask for clarification before the discussion moves on.</li>
					<li>Make sure that responsibility for, and commitment to, action, is obtained and recorded when necessary.</li>
					<li>After the event, follow up to ensure that outstanding actions and issues are progressed, and that the proceedings are brought to a successful conclusion.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Key Points</h4>

				<p>To be an effective facilitator you must know when to take a leadership role, and when to be neutral and take a back seat. This is a difficult balance to maintain! The key to being proficient in the role is to plan and guide the proceedings effectively, and remain focused on the group process and outcomes, rather than specific content and opinions involved.</p>

				<p>Facilitation is an interesting, rewarding and important role to take on. When facilitating, take time to think about the process and agenda, and learn the skills you need to take the event through to a successful conclusion. Take pride in the role of facilitation, and enjoy watching the ideas, solutions and successful outcomes flow!</p>

			<section class="subsection" data-number="17" data-name="Win-Win Negotiation">
				<h3>Win-Win Negotiation</h3>
				<div class="header-caption">Finding a fair compromise</div>

				<p class="skimmable">Do you feel that someone is continually taking advantage of you? Do you seem to have to fight your corner aggressively, or ally with others, to win the resources you need? Or do you struggle to get what you want from people whose help you need, but over whom you have little direct authority? If so, you may need to brush up your win-win negotiation skills.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">156</span></div>

				<p>Effective negotiation helps you to resolve situations where what you want conflicts with what someone else wants. The aim of win-win negotiation is to find a solution that is acceptable to both parties, and leaves both parties feeling that they&#39;ve won, in some way, after the event.</p>

				<p>There are different styles of negotiation, depending on circumstances.</p>

				<p>Where you do not expect to deal with people ever again and you do not need their goodwill, then it may be appropriate to &lsquo;play hardball&rsquo;, seeking to win a negotiation while the other person loses out. Many people go through this when they buy or sell a house - this is why house-buying can be such a confrontational and unpleasant experience.</p>

				<p>Similarly, where there is a great deal at stake in a negotiation, then it may be appropriate to prepare in detail and legitimate &lsquo;gamesmanship&rsquo; to gain advantage. Anyone who has been involved with large sales negotiations will be familiar with this.</p>

				<p>Neither of these approaches is usually much good for resolving disputes with people with whom you have an ongoing relationship: If one person plays hardball, then this disadvantages the other person - this may, quite fairly, lead to reprisal later. Similarly, using tricks and manipulation during a negotiation can undermine trust and damage teamwork. While a manipulative person may not get caught out if negotiation is infrequent, this is not the case when people work together routinely. Here, honesty and openness are almost always the best policies.</p>

				<h4>Preparing for a successful negotiation...</h4>

				<p>Depending on the scale of the disagreement, some preparation may be appropriate for conducting a successful negotiation.</p>

				<p>For small disagreements, excessive preparation can be counter-productive because it takes time that is better used elsewhere. It can also be seen as manipulative because, just as it strengthens your position, it can weaken the other person&#39;s.</p>

				<p>However, if you need to resolve a major disagreement, then make sure you prepare thoroughly. Using our free worksheet, think through the following points before you start negotiating:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Goals:</strong> what do you want to get out of the negotiation? What do you think the other person wants?</li>
					<li><strong>Trades:</strong> What do you and the other person have that you can trade? What do you each have that the other wants? What are you each comfortable giving away?</li>
					<li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> if you don&#39;t reach agreement with the other person, what alternatives do you have? Are these good or bad? How much does it matter if you do not reach agreement? Does failure to reach an agreement cut you out of future opportunities? And what alternatives might the other person have?</li>
					<li><strong>Relationships:</strong> what is the history of the relationship? Could or should this history impact the negotiation? Will there be any hidden issues that may influence the negotiation? How will you handle these?</li>
					<li><strong>Expected outcomes:</strong> what outcome will people be expecting from this negotiation? What has the outcome been in the past, and what precedents have been set?</li>
					<li><strong>The consequences:</strong> what are the consequences for you of winning or losing this negotiation? What are the consequences for the other person?</li>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">157</span></div>

					<li><strong>Power:</strong> who has what power in the relationship? Who controls resources? Who stands to lose the most if agreement isn&#39;t reached? What power does the other person have to deliver what you hope for?</li>
					<li><strong>Possible solutions:</strong> based on all of the considerations, what possible compromises might there be?</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Style is critical...</h4>

				<p>For a negotiation to be &lsquo;win-win&rsquo;, both parties should feel positive about the negotiation once it&#39;s over. This helps people keep good working relationships afterwards. This governs the style of the negotiation - histrionics and displays of emotion are clearly inappropriate because they undermine the rational basis of the negotiation and because they bring a manipulative aspect to them.</p>

				<p>Despite this, emotion can be an important subject of discussion because people&#39;s emotional needs must fairly be met. If emotion is not discussed where it needs to be, then the agreement reached can be unsatisfactory and temporary. Be as detached as possible when discussing your own emotions - perhaps discuss them as if they belong to someone else.</p>

				<h4>Negotiating successfully...</h4>

				<p>The negotiation itself is a careful exploration of your position and the other person&#39;s position, with the goal of finding a mutually acceptable compromise that gives you both as much of what you want as possible. People&#39;s positions are rarely as fundamentally opposed as they may initially appear - the other person may have very different goals from the ones you expect!</p>

				<p>In an ideal situation, you will find that the other person wants what you are prepared to trade, and that you are prepared to give what the other person wants.</p>

				<p>If this is not the case and one person must give way, then it is fair for this person to try to negotiate some form of compensation for doing so - the scale of this compensation will often depend on the many of the factors we discussed above. Ultimately, both sides should feel comfortable with the final solution if the agreement is to be considered win-win.</p>

				<p>Only consider win-lose negotiation if you don&#39;t need to have an ongoing relationship with the other party as, having lost, they are unlikely to want to work with you again. Equally, you should expect that if they need to fulfill some part of a deal in which you have &lsquo;won,&rsquo; they may be uncooperative and legalistic about the way they do this.</p>

				<h3>Hofstede&#39;s Cultural Dimensions</h3>
				<div class="header-caption">Understanding workplace values around the world</div>

				<p class="skimmable">We know we are living in a global age. Technology has brought the world much closer together. This means that people of different cultures find themselves working together and communicating more and more.</p>

				<p>This is exciting and interesting, but it can also be frustrating and fraught with uncertainty. How do you relate to someone of another culture? What do you say, or not say, to start a conversation off right? Are there cultural taboos you need to be aware of?</p>

				<p>Building connections with people from around the world is just one dimension of cultural diversity. You also have issues like motivating people, structuring projects, and developing strategy.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">158</span></div>

				<p>What works in one location may or may not work somewhere else. The question is, &lsquo;How can I come to understand these cultural differences?&rsquo; Are we relegated to learning from our mistakes or are there generalized guidelines to follow?</p>

				<p>Fortunately, a psychologist named Dr Geert Hofstede asked himself this question in the 1970s. What emerged after a decade of research and thousands of interviews is a model of cultural dimensions that has become an internationally recognized standard.</p>

				<p>With access to people working for the same organization in over 40 countries of the world, Hofstede collected cultural data and analyzed his findings. He initially identified four distinct cultural dimensions that served to distinguish one culture from another. Later he added a fifth dimension and that is how the model stands today.</p>

				<p>He scored each country using a scale of roughly 0 to 100 for each dimension. The higher the score, the more that dimension is exhibited in society.</p>

				<h4>The Five Dimensions of Culture</h4>

				<p>Armed with a large database of cultural statistics, Hofstede analyzed the results and found clear patterns of similarity and difference amid the responses along these five dimensions. Interestingly, his research was done on employees of IBM only, which allowed him to attribute the patterns to national differences in culture, largely eliminating the problem of differences in company culture.</p>

				<p>The five dimensions are:</p>

				<p><strong>1. Power/Distance &#40;PD&#41;</strong> - This refers to the degree of inequality that exists - and is accepted - among people with and without power. A high PD score indicates that society accepts an unequal distribution of power and people understand &lsquo;their place&rsquo; in the system. Low PD means that power is shared and well dispersed. It also means that society members view themselves as equals.</p>

				<p>Application: According to Hofstede&#39;s model, in a high PD country like Malaysia &#40;104&#41;, you would probably send reports only to top management and have closed door meetings where only a select few, powerful leaders were in attendance.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure1section9.17.png">
				</figure>

				<p><strong>2. Individualism &#40;IDV&#41;</strong> - This refers to the strength of the ties people have to others within the community. A high IDV score indicates a loose connection with people. In countries with a high IDV score there is a lack of interpersonal connection and little sharing of responsibility, beyond family and perhaps a few close friends. A society with a low IDV score would have strong group cohesion, and there would be a large amount of loyalty and respect for members of the group. The group itself is also larger and people take more responsibility for each other&#39;s well being.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">159</span></div>

				<p>Application: Hofstede&#39;s analysis suggests that in the Central American countries of Panama and Guatemala where the IDV scores are very low &#40;11 and 6, respectively&#41;, a marketing campaign that emphasized benefits to the community or that tied into a popular political movement would likely be understood and well-received.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure2section9.17.png">
				</figure>

				<p><strong>3. Masculinity &#40;MAS&#41;</strong> - This refers to how much a society sticks with, and values, traditional male and female roles. High MAS scores are found in countries where men are expected to be tough, to be the provider, to be assertive and to be strong. If women work outside the home, they have separate professions from men. Low MAS scores do not reverse the gender roles. In a low MAS society, the roles are simply blurred. You see women and men working together equally across many professions. Men are allowed to be sensitive and women can work hard for professional success.</p>

				<p>Application: Japan is highly masculine with a score of 95 whereas Sweden has the lowest measured value &#40;5&#41;. According to Hofstede&#39;s analysis, if you were to open an office in Japan, you might have greater success if you appointed a male employee to lead the team and had a strong male contingent on the team. In Sweden, on the other hand, you would aim for a team that was balanced in terms of skill rather than gender.</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure3section9.17.png">
				</figure>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">160</span></div>

				<p><strong>4. Uncertainty/Avoidance Index &#40;UAI&#41;</strong> - This relates to the degree of anxiety society members feel when in uncertain or unknown situations. High UAI-scoring nations try to avoid ambiguous situations whenever possible. They are governed by rules and order and they seek a collective &lsquo;truth&rsquo;. Low UAI scores indicate the society enjoys novel events and values differences. There are very few rules and people are encouraged to discover their own truth.</p>

				<p>Application: Hofstede&#39;s Cultural Dimensions imply that when discussing a project with people in Belgium, whose country scored a 94 on the UAI scale, you should investigate the various options and then present a limited number of choices, but have very detailed information available on your contingency and risk plans. &#40;Note that there will be cultural differences between French and Dutch speakers in Belgium!&#41;</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="/contents/mindtools/images/figure4section9.17.png">
				</figure>

				<p><strong>5. Long Term Orientation &#40;LTO&#41;</strong> - This refers to how much society values long-standing - as opposed to short term - traditions and values. This is the fifth dimension that Hofstede added in the 1990s after finding that Asian countries with a strong link to Confucian philosophy acted differently from western cultures. In countries with a high LTO score, delivering on social obligations and avoiding &lsquo;loss of face&rsquo; are considered very important.</p>

				<p>Application: According to Hofstede&#39;s analysis, people in the United States and United Kingdom have low LTO scores. This suggests that you can pretty much expect anything in this culture in terms of creative expression and novel ideas. The model implies that people in the US and UK don&#39;t value tradition as much as many others, and are therefore likely to be willing to help you execute the most innovative plans as long as they get to participate fully. &#40;This may be surprising to people in the UK, with its associations of tradition!&#41;</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">161</span></div>

				<p>For a list of scores by dimension per country and more detailed information about Hofstede&#39;s research, visit his website.</p>

				<div class="grey-background">
					<strong>Note:</strong>
					<p>Hofstede&#39;s analysis is done by country. While this is valid for many countries, it does not hold in the countries where there are strong subcultures that are based on ethnicity of origin or geography. In Canada, for instance, there is a distinct French Canadian culture that has quite a different set of norms compared to English-speaking Canada. And in Italy, masculinity scores would differ between North and South.</p>
				</div>

				<h4>Key Points</h4>

				<p>Cultural norms play a large part in the mechanics and interpersonal relationships at work. When you grow up in a culture you take your norms of behavior for granted. You don&#39;t have to think about your reactions, preferences, and feelings.</p>

				<p>When you step into a foreign culture, suddenly things seem different. You don&#39;t know what to do or say. Using Hofstede&#39;s Cultural Dimensions as a starting point, you can evaluate your approach, your decisions, and actions based on a general sense of how the society might think and react to you.</p>

				<div class="pagebreak"><span class="pageNumber">162</span></div>

				<p>Of course, no society is homogenous and there will be deviations from the norms Hofstede found, however, with this as your guide you won&#39;t be going in blind. The unknown will be a little less intimidating and you&#39;ll get a much-needed boost of confidence and security from studying this cultural model.</p>

				<div class="yellow-background">
					<div class="grey-header">Apply This to Your Life:</div>
					<p>Take some time to review the scores by country for the various cultural dimensions Hofstede identified. Pay particular attention to the countries from which the people you deal with on a day-by-day basis come.</p>
					<p>In light of these scores, think about some interactions you&#39;ve had with people in other countries. Does your conversation or association make more sense given this newly found insight?</p>
					<p>Challenge yourself to learn more about one culture in particular. If your work brings you in contact with people from another country, use that country as your point of reference. Apply Hofstede&#39;s scores to what you discover and determine the accuracy and relevance for you.</p>
					<p>The next time you are required to work with a person from a different culture, use Hofstede&#39;s scores and make notes about your approach, what you should be prepared to discuss, and why you feel the way you do. Afterward, evaluate your performance and do further research and preparation for the next time.</p>
					<p>Above all, make cultural sensitivity a daily part of your life. Learn to value the differences between people and vow to honor and respect the things that make each nation of people unique.</p>
