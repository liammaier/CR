				Overview: Infectious Diseases Spreading

			<p>
				West Nile virus.  Hantavirus. Lyme disease. All are infectious diseases spreading in animals,
				and in humans. Is our interaction with the environment somehow responsible for the increase in incidence of these diseases?

					Pathogens, or disease-causing microbes, rarely cause extinctions in the species they infect. There are a
					few examples, however, where a pathogen may have resulted in extinction of a species. Frogs in El Cope,
					Panama, affected by a fungus called chytridiomycosis are a case-in-point. One frog species there which
					lived along riverbanks disappeared completely within one month.

				A joint National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health program--Ecology and Evolution of
				Infectious Diseases (EEID)-- supports efforts to understand the underlying ecological and biological mechanisms
				behind human-induced environmental changes and the emergence and transmission of infectious diseases. Projects
				funded through the EEID program and other NSF programs allow scientists to study how large-scale environmental
				events--such as habitat destruction, invasions of non-native species and pollution—alter the risks of emergence
				of viral, parasitic and bacterial diseases in humans and animals.
			</p>

			<p>
				Researchers supported in the EEID program are advancing basic theory related to infectious diseases and applying
				that knowledge to improve our understanding of how pathogens spread through populations at a time of increasing global change.
			</p>

			<p>
				The benefits of research on the ecology of infectious diseases include development of theories of how diseases
				are transmitted, improved understanding of unintended health effects of development projects; increased capacity
				to forecast disease outbreaks and knowledge of how infectious diseases emerge and reemerge.

					Disease transmission is a complex process that involves the disease organism, disease vectors,
					disease hosts and the predators of those hosts. It links relatively pristine areas with human
					habitations and human-dominated areas.

				"Virtually all the world's terrestrial and aquatic communities have undergone dramatic changes in biodiversity
				due primarily to habitat transformations such as deforestation and agricultural intensification, invasions of
				exotic species, chemical contamination and climate-change events," said Sam Scheiner, EEID program director at
				NSF. "The coincidence of broad-scale environmental changes with the emergence of infectious diseases may point
				to underlying and predictable ecological relationships."
			</p>

			<p>
				Examples of studies funded by the EEID program include research on the origin and spread of the aspergillus-gorgonian
				coral disease and how climate and environment may have worked as facilitators of the disease; effects of human-induced
				change on the ecology of human pathogens in North Carolina’s Neuse River estuary, which is polluted by excess nutrients
				from human activities; the microbial community ecology of tick-borne human pathogens; plague as a model for disease
				dynamics; ecological reasons for rodent-borne disease outbreaks; and how social organization influences an infectious
				disease outbreak.
