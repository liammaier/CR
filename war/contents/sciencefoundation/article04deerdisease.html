				Researchers funded through the EEID program recently found that chronic wasting disease (CWD) can be
				transmitted through environments contaminated by whole carcasses or by excrement of animals infected
				with the pathogen that causes CWD.  CWD is rampant in Western states like Colorado.
			</p>

			<p>
				"Diseases like CWD are poorly understood and of rising concern," said Sam Scheiner, EEID program director
				at NSF. "This new knowledge will substantially alter how we manage the disease in wild and domestic animals."
			</p>

			<p>
				CWD is a fatal neurological ailment of elk, white-tailed deer and mule deer.  Researchers believe the disease
				is caused by an aberrant prion protein that misfolds in the brain, destroying brain tissue as it progresses.
				The disease is always fatal and there is no known cure or treatment.
			</p>

			<p>
				Although live deer and elk still seem the most likely way for CWD to spread geographically, environmental
				sources could contribute to maintaining and prolonging local epidemics, even when all infected animals are
				eliminated, said biologist Tom Hobbs of Colorado State University. "Through the EEID program, we hope to
				develop models that will predict the behavior of the disease, shedding light on how potentially complex
				these epidemics may be in natural populations."

				Further information about CWD is available on the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance Web site.
