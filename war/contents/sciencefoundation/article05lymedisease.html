				Lyme Disease on the Rise
			</h1>

			<p>
				Lyme disease incidence is rising in the United States and is in fact far more common than West Nile virus
				and other insect-borne diseases.  Forest fragmentation could explain the increase.
			</p>

			<p>
				Areas of patchy woods, which are very common in cities and suburban and rural areas, may have higher populations
				of Lyme-disease carrying ticks than forest fragments, which generally have fewer species than continuous habitat.
				This is because some species thrive in smaller places.
			</p>

			<p>
				White-footed mice, for example, are more abundant in forest fragments in some parts of the country, likely because
				fewer predators and competitors remain there. These mice are particularly abundant in patches smaller than about
				five acres, which could spell trouble for people living nearby: the mice are the main carriers of Lyme disease-causing
				bacteria. In the eastern and central United States, Lyme disease is contracted via blacklegged ticks that feed on
				infected mice, then transmit the bacteria when the ticks bite people. As a result, says biologist Felicia Keesing
				of Bard College in Annandale, New York, Lyme disease is concentrated in areas where people live near forests with
				blacklegged ticks.
			</p>

			<p>
				Keesing, scientist Richard Ostfeld of the Cary Institute in New York and other researchers found that smaller
				forest fragments had more infected ticks, which could translate to more Lyme disease. Forest patches that were
				smaller than three acres had an average of three times as many ticks as did larger fragments, and seven times
				more infected ticks. As many as 80 percent of the ticks in the smallest patches were infected, the highest rate
				the scientists have seen. These ticks may also be infected with other emerging diseases--Babesiosis, Anaplasmosis
				and Powassan encephalitis--therefore, forest fragmentation might also be contributing to other serious illnesses,
				Ostfeld says.
			</p>

			<p>
				"Our results suggest that efforts to reduce the risk of Lyme disease should be directed toward decreasing
				fragmentation of deciduous forests of the northeastern United States, particularly in areas with a high
				incidence of Lyme disease," says Keesing. "The creation of forest fragments smaller than five acres should
				especially be avoided."
