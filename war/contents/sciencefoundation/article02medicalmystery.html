				Medical Mystery Solved
			</h1>

			<p>
				When young, otherwise healthy people in the remote Four Corners area of Arizona and New Mexico began dying
				of a mysterious, acute respiratory disease in the spring of 1993, scientists wondered at the cause.
			</p>

			<p>
				Tests of the victims’ blood yielded surprising results: the people had become infected with a previously undetected
				kind of hantavirus.  Named for the Hantaan River in Korea, hantaviruses were known to spread from rodents to humans
				in Asia and Europe, but until the Four Corners outbreak, the microbes had only been seen outside of the United States.

				For answers as to how the virus spread in the Four Corners, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control turned
				to scientists Robert Parmenter of the Sevilleta (SEV) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in New
				Mexico, and Terry Yates of the University of New Mexico.  Their research at the LTER site revealed that
				the hantavirus outbreak could be blamed on El Niño, a periodic pattern of change in the global circulation
				of oceans and atmosphere.  Massive rains associated with the 1991-1992 El Niño had substantially boosted
				plant productivity after several years of drought. A banner year for plants was followed by a banner year
				for rodents. More mice meant that more humans stood a greater chance of exposure to infected rodents as
				people moved among barns and did spring cleaning of cabins and trailers.
			</p>

			<p>
				The deadly hantavirus wasn’t new to New Mexico.  The virus had been in the rodents all along.  It was the
				change in climate conditions that triggered the fatal outbreak in humans.  Such knowledge likely saved
				lives in 1998, when another active El Niño prompted health authorities to warn residents in the American
				Southwest to use caution when entering areas favored by mice.
